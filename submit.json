Mitigation of biodiversity loss requires science that integrates both ecological and evolutionary responses of populations and communities to rapid environmental change, and can identify the conditions that allow the recovery of declining populations. This special issue focuses on evolutionary rescue (ER), the idea that evolution might occur sufficiently fast to arrest population decline and allow population recovery before extinction ensues. ER emphasizes a shift to a perspective on evolutionary dynamics that focuses on short time-scales, genetic variants of large effects and absolute rather than relative fitness. The contributions in this issue reflect the state of field; the articles address the latest conceptual developments, and report novel theoretical and experimental results. The examples in this issue demonstrate that this burgeoning area of research can inform problems of direct practical concern, such as the conservation of biodiversity, adaptation to climate change and the emergence of infectious disease. The continued development of research on ER will be necessary if we are to understand the extent to which anthropogenic global change will reduce the Earth's biodiversity."}}

Identifying candidate maintenance and reservoir species is therefore a central component of disease management. The term maintenance species implies that if all species but the putative maintenance species were removed, then the pathogen would still persist. In the absence of field manipulations, this statement inherently requires a causal or mechanistic model to assess. However, we lack a systematic understanding of (i) how often conclusions are made about maintenance and reservoir species without reference to mechanistic models (ii) what types of biases may be associated with these conclusions and (iii) how explicitly invoking causal or mechanistic modelling can help ameliorate these biases. Filling these knowledge gaps is critical for robust inference about pathogen persistence and spillover in multihost–parasite systems, with clear implications for human and wildlife health. To address these gaps, we performed a literature review on the evidence previous studies have used to make claims regarding maintenance or reservoir species. We then developed multihost–parasite models to explore and demonstrate common biases that could arise when inferring maintenance potential from observational prevalence data. Finally, we developed new theory to show how model-driven inference of maintenance species can minimize and eliminate emergent biases. In our review, we found that 83% of studies used some form of observational prevalence data to draw conclusions on maintenance potential and only 6% of these studies combined observational data with mechanistic modelling. Using our model, we demonstrate how the community, spatial and temporal context of observational data can lead to substantial biases in inferences of maintenance potential. Importantly, our theory identifies that model-driven inference of maintenance species elucidates other streams of observational data that can be leveraged to correct these biases. Model-driven inference is an essential, yet underused, component of multidisciplinary studies that make inference about host reservoir and maintenance species. Better integration of wildlife disease surveillance and mechanistic models is necessary to improve the robustness and reproducibility of our conclusions regarding maintenance and reservoir species."}}

Recently, however, motherless protein-coding genes have been found to have emerged de novo from ancestral non-coding DNAs. How these genes originated is not well addressed to date. Here we identified 24 hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes with precise origination timing in vertebrate phylogeny. Strand-specific RNA-Seq analyses were performed in five rhesus macaque tissues (liver, prefrontal cortex, skeletal muscle, adipose, and testis), which were then integrated with public transcriptome data from human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque. On the basis of comparing the RNA expression profiles in the three species, we found that most of the hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes encoded polyadenylated non-coding RNAs in rhesus macaque or chimpanzee with a similar transcript structure and correlated tissue expression profile. According to the rule of parsimony, the majority of these hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes appear to have acquired a regulated transcript structure and expression profile before acquiring coding potential. Interestingly, although the expression profile was largely correlated, the coding genes in human often showed higher transcriptional abundance than their non-coding counterparts in rhesus macaque. The major findings we report in this manuscript are robust and insensitive to the parameters used in the identification and analysis of de novo genes. Our results suggest that at least a portion of long non-coding RNAs, especially those with active and regulated transcription, may serve as a birth pool for protein-coding genes, which are then further optimized at the transcriptional level."}}

In particular, neither the strongest immune responses nor the lowest parasite densities necessarily maximize host fitness. 3. Here, we propose that ecoimmunologists should routinely endeavour to measure three intertwined parameters: host fitness, parasite density, and relevant immune responses. We further propose that analyses of relationships among these traits would benefit from the statistical machinery used for analyses of phenotypic plasticity and/or methods that are robust to the bi-directional causation inherent in host-parasite relationships. For example, analyses of how host fitness depends upon parasite density, which is an evolutionary ecological definition of tolerance, would benefit from these more robust methods. 4. Together, these steps promote rigorous quantification of the fitness consequences of immune responses. Such quantification is essential if ecoimmunologists are to decipher causes of immune polymorphism in nature and predict trajectories of natural selection on immune defense."}}

Although a variety of approaches model structured population dynamics, they are limited to specific types of spatially structured populations and lack a unifying framework. Here, we propose a unified network-­based framework sufficiently novel in its flexibility to capture a wide variety of spatiotemporal processes including metapopulations and a range of migratory patterns. It can accommodate different kinds of age structures, forms of population growth, dispersal, nomadism and migration, and alternative life-­history strategies. Our objective was to link three general elements common to all spatially structured populations (space, time and movement) under a single mathematical framework. To do this, we adopt a network modeling approach. The spatial structure of a population is represented by a weighted and directed network. Each node and each edge has a set of attributes which vary through time. The dynamics of our network-­based population is modeled with discrete time steps. Using both theoretical and real-­ world examples, we show how common elements recur across species with disparate movement strategies and how they can be combined under a unified mathematical framework. We illustrate how metapopulations, various migratory patterns, and nomadism can be represented with this modeling approach. We also apply our network-­based framework to four organisms spanning a wide range of life histories, movement patterns, and carrying capacities. General computer code to implement our framework is provided, which can be applied to almost any spatially structured population. This framework contributes to our theoretical understanding of population dynamics and has practical management applications, including understanding the impact of perturbations on population size, distribution, and movement patterns. By working within a common framework, there is less chance that comparative analyses are colored by model details rather than general principles."}}

A direct relationship was found between reproductive status, which was established by external examination of the genitalia, and body weight. No such relationship was established between reproductive status and forearm length. A strong direct relationship was found between reproductive status and an index of body condition (body weight/forearm length). Three of the males examined had distended epididymides, suggesting they were filled with spermatozoa, and that the bats concerned had recently undergone spermatogenesis.\n            \n            Reproductive status also varied between maternity roosts.

In addition to decreasing energy expenditure during the day, they typically alter foraging patterns as well. It is well known that various environmental conditions influence both torpor and foraging patterns, but studies of these factors often have focussed on one element in isolation thus it is not known how the two behaviours are collectively influencing temperate bats. The objective of our study was to assess how reproductive condition and environmental factors concurrently affect energy balance in female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). We equipped pregnant and lactating bats in southwest Saskatchewan, Canada with temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. While transmitters were active, skin temperature data were collected and foraging patterns were determined using triangulation. Of the various environmental and physiological parameters used to model torpor characteristics, roost type was the most important factor. Bats roosting in trees used deeper and longer torpor bouts than those roosting in buildings. Lactating bats had a tendency to forage for longer durations than pregnant bats, and often made more foraging trips. When taken together, we found that foraging duration and torpor duration were not directly related during pregnancy, but exhibited an inverse relationship during lactation. This provides support for the hypothesis that there are physiological trade-offs for reproductive bats and suggests that how bats compensate is not entirely predictable based on current environmental conditions."}}

The new species (Myotis handleyi, sp. nov.) can be distinguished from other South American congeners by the following set of traits: dorsal fur long, silky, and bicolored with burnished tips; skull long; rostrum long and broad; frontals moderately to steeply sloping; sagittal crest absent or very low; plagiopatagium broadly attached to the foot at the level of the base of the toes; fringe of hairs along the trailing edge of uropatagium absent; and fur on uropatagium not reaching knees. We review Colombian and Venezuelan samples of Myotis, covering all of the currently recognized species known from these countries. Based on our analyses, we provide a sketch of the taxonomic diversity of the genus in Colombia and Venezuela, along with a key to their identification. Among other conclusions, we elevate M. nigricans caucensis to the species level; confirm that populations of M. nigricans from the opposite sides of the Andes represent the same taxon; retain J.A. Allen’s names M. esmeraldae, M. bondae, and M. maripensis in the synonymy of M. nigricans; and document clinal variation in size along an altitudinal gradient for M. nigricans, with larger specimens from higher elevations.

Success of management depends greatly on the capacity to determine where and how interventions should take place, so models predicting how animals use landscapes are important to plan them. Bats are quite distinctive in the way they use space for foraging because (i) most are colonial central-place foragers and (ii) exploit scattered and distant resources, although this increases flying costs. To evaluate how important distances to resources are in modelling foraging bat habitat suitability, we radio-tracked two cave-dwelling species of conservation concern (Rhinolophus mehelyi and Miniopterus schreibersii) in a Mediterranean landscape. Habitat and distance variables were evaluated using logistic regression modelling. Distance variables greatly increased the performance of models, and distance to roost and to drinking water could alone explain 86 and 73% of the use of space by M. schreibersii and R. mehelyi, respectively. Land-cover and soil productivity also provided a significant contribution to the final models. Habitat suitability maps generated by models with and without distance variables differed substantially, confirming the shortcomings of maps generated without distance variables. Indeed, areas shown as highly suitable in maps generated without distance variables proved poorly suitable when distance variables were also considered. We concluded that distances to resources are determinant in the way bats forage across the landscape, and that using distance variables substantially improves the accuracy of suitability maps generated with spatially explicit models. Consequently, modelling with these variables is important to guide habitat management in bats and similarly mobile animals, particularly if they are central-place foragers or depend on spatially scarce resources."}}

By multiplying together the average annual prey capture rates of the predators, assessed from their energetic food requirements and direct observations of prey intake rates, the British populations of the predators and the contribution to the diet made by bats, the annual number of bats which die each year as a result of predation was estimated. The total losses of bats to predation might amount to about 201 400 bats/annum. The most significant predators are Tawny Owl (\n              c.\n              168 850 bats/annum), Barn Owl (c. 8800 bats/ annum), Long‐eared Owl (c. 10 200 bats/annum) and Kestrels (c. 8400 bats/annum). This predation by avian predators would account for about 11 % of the annual mortality of British bats. An assessment of the biases involved in this calculation suggests it is probably a minimum estimate. Despite the apparent low representation of bats in the diets of predatory birds, the effects of this predation on bat behaviour and population dynamics cannot be ignored."}}

Here, we studied the fuel choice of migratory Pipistrellus nathusii (approximate weight: 8 g) by analysing the stable carbon isotope ratio (δ(13)C(V-PDB)) of breath and potential energy sources. Breath δ(13)C(V-PDB) was intermediate between δ(13)C(V-PDB) of insect prey and adipocyte triacylglycerols, suggesting a mixed-fuel use of P. nathusii during autumn migration. To clarify the origin of oxidized fatty acids, we performed feeding experiments with captive P. nathusii. After an insect diet, bat breath was enriched in (13)C relative to the bulk and fat portion of insects, but not deviating from the non-fat portion of insects, suggesting that bats oxidized exogenous proteins and carbohydrates, but not exogenous fatty acids. A feeding experiment with (13)C-labelled substrates confirmed these findings. In conclusion, migratory P. nathusii oxidized dietary proteins directly from insects captured en route in combination with endogenous fatty acids from adipocytes, and replenished their body reserves by routing dietary fatty acids to their body reserves."}}

Growing evidence is biased towards the comparison of populations from discrete categories of land uses, ignoring the role of landscape emerging properties on the phenotype selection of wild fauna. Across the largest urban–rural gradient of the Colombian Orinoquia, we measured ecomorphological traits of 216 individuals of the flat-faced fruit-eating bat Artibeus planirostris. We did this to evaluate the scale of effect at which landscape transformation better predicts changes in phenotype and abundance of an urban-tolerant species. Forest percentage at 1.25 km was the main predictor affecting negatively bat abundance and positively its wing aspect ratio and body mass. Landscape variables affected forearm length at all spatial scales, this effect appeared to be sex-dependent, and the most important predictor, forest percentage at 0.5 km, had a negative effect on this trait. Our results indicate that landscape elements and spatial scale interact to shape ecomorphological traits and the abundance of A. planirostris. Interestingly, the scale of effect coincided at 1.25 km among all biological responses, suggesting that species’ abundance can be linked to the variation on phenotype under different environmental filters across landscape scenarios."}}

These taxa—Mormoops blainvillei, Pteronotus parnellii, and P. quadridens—roost predominantly in hot cave chambers where temperatures may reach 40° C and humidity is close to 100%. We tested the hypothesis that mormoopid bat extirpations in this region were due to climatic changes and the loss of suitable cave environments due to flooding caused by sea level rise associated with the late Pleistocene to Holocene (ca. 10 ka) climate change transition. Ecological niche models (ENMs) were developed to estimate the current, mid-Holocene, and Last Glacial Maximum distributions of these three bat species and to assess whether suitable climatic habitat for these taxa had been stable across time in the Caribbean. Additionally, we examined the importance of karst formations (where hot caves typically form) as a predictor for the distributions of Caribbean mormoopid bats. Our results show that mormoopid bat distributions in the Caribbean have remained relatively stable over time with climate ENMs indicating up to a 19% expansion in the amount of suitable habitat from late Pleistocene to the present. Presence of karst was a good predictor when used alone or when combined as karst-climate ENMs. Fossil evidence shows that some populations of mormoopids became extirpated as recently as 3.6 ka. These data, taken together with our conclusion that suitable climate habitat for mormoopid bats existed in the Caribbean beyond late Pleistocene to Holocene transition, suggest that these bats may have survived this climate change event by roosting outside their characteristic hot cave environment."}}

Considering the geographic morphometric variation and the molecular divergence previously documented in genus Noctilio, we analyze two-dimensional geometric configurations of cranial characters to assess if the amount of morphological variation or the existence of morphological discontinuities within Noctilio species is compatible with the possible existence of several species, as well as their relationships in a combined phylogenetic reconstruction. The shape and size variation of cranial characters supports differences among two of three molecular lineages previously reported in N. albiventris—one distributed in Central America and North of South America, and the other distributed in South America. We also recover differences between the two mitochondrial clades for N. leporinus, one distributed from Mexico to the west side of the Andes and the Greater Antilles, and the other to the eastern side of the Andes and the Lesser Antilles. Based on the combined phylogeny, we recover the paraphyly of N. albiventris, composed of two morphologically differentiated taxa, and the monophyly of N. leporinus, composed of two morphologically divergent lineages. The latitudinal position and environmental variables correlate with cranial variation and support the geographic pattern of differentiation in the evolutionary history of Noctilio."}}

We hypothesized that social instability, especially in the breeding groups and especially in P. vampyrus, would result in elevated glucocorticoids and that social facilitation of breeding and/or male-male competition would result in persistently higher levels of testosterone in breeding males. Seasonal rhythms in all measures were also predicted, and the glucocorticoid stress response was expected to vary by sex, season, and group type. Nearly all animals responded to group formation with elevated glucocorticoids, but, for breeding animals (especially aggressive male P. vampyrus), these responses persisted over time. In both species, breeding group formation resulted in elevated testosterone in males. Glucocorticoids, testosterone, testes volume, and body mass generally peaked in the breeding season in males (late summer and early autumn), but the seasonal glucocorticoid peak in females occurred in late winter and early spring. All animals responded to restraint stress with elevations in glucocorticoids that largely did not differ by sex, time of year, reproductive condition, group type, or, in lactating females, the presence of her pup. Changes in both behavior and physiology were more evident in P. vampyrus than in P. pumilus, and we believe that their underlying social differences influenced their responses to group formation and to the changing seasonal environment. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Phase I: With increased walking on savannas, early human ancestors inhaled crustal dust, fecal aerosols, and spores; carrion scavenging introduced new infectious pathogens. Phase II: Domestic fire exposed early Homo to novel toxins from smoke and cooking. Phases III and IV: Neolithic to preindustrial Homo sapiens incurred infectious pathogens from domestic animals and dense communities with limited sanitation. Phase V: Industrialization introduced novel toxins from fossil fuels, industrial chemicals, and tobacco at the same time infectious pathogens were diminishing. Thereby, pathogen-driven causes of mortality were replaced by chronic diseases driven by sterile inflammogens, exogenous and endogenous.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the control of viral replication in bats are not understood and there is little information available on any aspect of antiviral immunity in bats. Massively parallel sequencing of the bat transcriptome provides the opportunity for rapid gene discovery. Although the genomes of one megabat and one microbat have now been sequenced to low coverage, no transcriptomic datasets have been reported from any bat species. In this study, we describe the immune transcriptome of the Australian flying fox, Pteropus alecto, providing an important resource for identification of genes involved in a range of activities including antiviral immunity.\\n\\nRESULTS: Towards understanding the adaptations that have allowed bats to coexist with viruses, we have de novo assembled transcriptome sequence from immune tissues and stimulated cells from P. alecto. We identified about 18,600 genes involved in a broad range of activities with the most highly expressed genes involved in cell growth and maintenance, enzyme activity, cellular components and metabolism and energy pathways. 3.5% of the bat transcribed genes corresponded to immune genes and a total of about 500 immune genes were identified, providing an overview of both innate and adaptive immunity. A small proportion of transcripts found no match with annotated sequences in any of the public databases and may represent bat-specific transcripts.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first reported bat transcriptome dataset and provides a survey of expressed bat genes that complement existing bat genomic data. In addition, these data provide insight into genes relevant to the antiviral responses of bats, and form a basis for examining the roles of these molecules in immune response to viral infection."}}

Wildlife extinction rates are estimated to be 100–1000 times greater than the historical norm, and up to 50% of higher taxonomic groups are critically endangered. While many types of environmental changes threaten the survival of species all over the planet, infectious disease has rarely been cited as the primary cause of global species extinctions. There is substantial evidence, however, that diseases can greatly impact local species populations by causing temporary or permanent declines in abundance. More importantly, pathogens can interact with other driving factors, such as habitat loss, climate change, overexploitation, invasive species and environmental pollution to contribute to local and global extinctions. Regrettably, our current lack of knowledge about the diversity and abundance of pathogens in natural systems has made it difﬁcult to establish the relative importance of disease as a signiﬁcant driver of species extinction, and the context when this is most likely to occur. Here, we review the role of infectious diseases in biological conservation. We summarize existing knowledge of diseaseinduced extinction at global and local scales and review the ecological and evolutionary forces that may facilitate disease-mediated extinction risk. We suggest that while disease alone may currently threaten few species, pathogens may be a signiﬁcant threat to already-endangered species, especially when disease interacts with other drivers. We identify control strategies that may help reduce the negative effects of disease on wildlife and discuss the most critical challenges and future directions for the study of infectious diseases in the conservation sciences."}}

We compared the activity of bats in three forest management areas across four stand ages of managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in western Poland. Stand ages included clear-cut stands, young (2–5 year) stands, middle-aged (41–60 year) stands, and mature (> 80 years) stands. We sampled bat activity by walking transects with a broadband ultrasound Pettersson D-1000X detector. Across our study area, highest bat activity was in clear-cut and young stands and lowest in mature stands. Bat species adapted to foraging in open habitats had high activity in clear and young stands, while those adapted to closed habitats had high activity in middle-aged and mature stands. Our results suggest that the presence of mature pine forests is important for closed-habitat foragers, including rare and threatened bat species, and active management to increase mature forest areas is important. At the same time, a mosaic of different growth stages of stands can support high activity of open- and edgehabitat foragers."}}

Flowers of the African sausage tree Kigelia africana are visited by bats and bush babies during the night and by birds during the day. We studied floral traits (phenophases, scent, color, and nectar chemistry) and the visitation frequency and pollination effectiveness of different flower visitors to determine whether K. africana is functionally specialized for bat pollination. We found that flower opening corresponds with bat activity, flowers emit scent dominated by aliphatic esters and alcohols, and that nectar is produced in copious amounts accessible to bats. Pollen deposition on stigmas was twenty-fold greater per visit by bats than it was per visit by birds, likely a result of the close morphological fit between snouts of bats and the flowers. However, bat visits appear to be rare at some sites and the delayed senescence of flowers that are open throughout the morning provides an opportunity for additional pollination by birds. We conclude that K. africana is primarily adapted for bat pollination, but is also able to exploit other animals for pollination."}}

The present study determined the breeding system and legitimate pollinators of Oroxylum indicum Vent, in Songkhla and Patthalung Provinces, Thailand. Oroxylum indicum exhibits steady-state flowering, with one or two flowers per inflorescence opening each night. Flowers open in the evening and drop off shortly after midnight, while its bilabiate stigma is highly sensitive, and quickly close upon being touched. Oroxylum indicum is self-incompatible. Hand-cross pollination and open pollination yielded the highest pollination success (47.7% and 31.2% respectively, n = 7 trees). About 900 pollen grains are needed for initiating fruit set. It is confirmed that a fruit bat, Eonycteris spelaea, is the legitimate pollinator. Bats are responsible for all pollen load and the pollen load from only one visit is generally sufficient to initiate fruit set. Although Eonycteris spelaea is effective, it is an inefficient pollinator. Compared with plant species pollinated by multiple animal species, the likelihood of pollination failure resulting from the decline in populations of Eonycteris spelaea will be much more intense in Oroxylum indicum."}}

The possible role of E. gambianus as a reservoir host of zoonotic diseases underlines the need to better understand the species movement patterns. So far, neither observational nor phylogenetic studies have identified the dispersal range or behavior of this species. Comparative analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear markers from 20 localities across the known distribution of E. gambianus showed population panmixia, except for the populations in Ethiopia and southern Ghana (Accra and Ve-Golokwati). The Ethiopian population may be ancestral and is highly divergent to the species across the rest of its range, possibly reflecting isolation of an ancient colonization along an east-west axis. Mitochondrial haplotypes in the Accra population display a strong signature of a past bottleneck event; evidence of either an ancient or recent bottleneck using microsatellite data, however, was not detected. Demographic analyses identified population expansion in most of the colonies, except in the female line of descent in the Accra population. The molecular analyses of the colonies from Ethiopia and southern Ghana show gender dispersal bias, with the mitochondrial DNA fixation values over ten times those of the nuclear markers. These findings indicate free mixing of the species across great distances, which should inform future epidemiological studies."}}

Diet was similar across sites and Coleoptera was the main prey item by percentage volume (75%), followed by Hemiptera (13%). Carabidae and Scarabidae were the most frequent coleopterans found in the diet. Direct observations (n = 3) were made of bats ﬂying short distances from perches along forest trails to prey on Cicadidae (c. 20 mm in length) located on tree trunks. There were differences in the composition of faecal samples collected form netted bats and pellets collected under feeding perches, with the latter consisting of more Blattoptera (Blattellidae ‘cockroaches’). Hipposideros commersoni appears to have a unique foraging behaviour and diet among Malagasy microchiropterans and its preference for certain Coleoptera and other large invertebrates may account for reported seasonal variation in body fattening and activity."}}

Additionally, bonneted bats in Florida have a broader palate than bats from populations in South America. Given these differences, the correct name for both Pleistocene and Recent Florida bonneted bats is Eumops ﬂoridanus (Allen, 1932). We found no geographic variation in Recent populations of Florida Eumops and little secondary sexual variation. We describe and review the distribution, morphometrics, systematics, ecology, and taxonomic history of the species, which is restricted to southern Florida.

Wild animals are constantly exposed to variations in the availability of food resources and they need to balance their energy budget to fight against pathogens. We examined the effect of food restriction in the fish eating Myotis (Myotis vivesi), a species of bat that experiences periods in which foraging is limited due to ambient conditions. We tested the hypothesis that acute food restriction (∼65% restriction for 1 night) would reduce the caloric response to lipopolysaccharidae (LPS) injection compared to bats fed ad libitum. We also measured a proxy for body temperature (Tskin) and expected reduced fever development when food intake was limited. Bats on the restricted diet had similar resting metabolic rate, total caloric cost and Tskin after the LPS challenge than when fed ad libitum. However, there was a delay in the metabolic and pyrogenic responses when bats were on the restricted diet. The effect of acute food restriction in delaying the hyperthermia development in fish eating Myotis might be of importance for its capacity to fight pathogens. Similar to other bats, the fish eating Myotis can fast for several consecutive days by entering torpor and future work is warranted to understand the effect of long periods of food restriction on bat immune response."}}

One phylum (Proteobacteria), one class (Gammaproteobacteria), three orders (Pseudomonadales, Lactobacillales, Bacillales), four families (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae), and five genera (Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Carnobacterium, an unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter) accounted for 50% of sequences. There were no significant differences in the relative abundances of any phyla between bat species, but various differences were noted at lower taxonomic levels, such as Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.007, most abundant in M. blythii), Pseudomonadaceae (P = 0.007, most abundant in Rhinolophus hipposideros) and Chlamydiaceae (P = 0.04, most abundant in Myotis myotis). There were significant differences in richness between species in both adults and juveniles/ subadults, but there was no impact of sex on any alpha diversity index. When only adults are considered, there were significant differences in community membership between M. blythii and M. emarginatus (P = 0.011), and M. blythii and R. hipposideros (P = 0.004). There were also significant differences in community structure between M. blythii and M. emarginatus (P = 0.025), and M. blythii and R. hipposideros (P = 0.026).

According to the original description, M. aelleni is closest morphologically to M. chiloensis (Waterhouse, 1840), but can be distinguished based on the tricolored dorsal hairs and skull size and shape. The taxonomic status of M. aelleni has been questioned but the species is still treated as valid. Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of the type series of M. aelleni, and series of M. chiloensis, including the neotype, we recognize M. aelleni as a junior synonym of M. chiloensis.

Knowledge of the bat species that maintain rabies is a crucial first step in reducing this public health problem. In North America, several bat species are known to be rabies virus reservoirs but the role of bats of the Myotis genus has been unclear due to the scarcity of laboratory confirmed cases and the challenges encountered in species identification of poorly preserved diagnostic submissions by morphological traits alone. This study has employed a collection of rabid bat specimens collected across Canada over a 25 year period to clearly define the role of particular Myotis species as rabies virus reservoirs. The virus was characterised by partial genome sequencing and host genetic barcoding, used to confirm species assignment of specimens, proved crucial to the identification of certain bat species as disease reservoirs. Several variants were associated with Myotis species limited in their Canadian range to the westernmost province of British Columbia while others were harboured by Myotis species that circulate across much of eastern and central Canada. All of these Myotis-associated viral variants, except for one, clustered as a monophyletic MYCAN clade, which has emerged from a lineage more broadly distributed across North America; in contrast one distinct variant, associated with the long-legged bat in Canada, represents a relatively recent host jump from a big brown bat reservoir. Together with evidence from South America, these findings demonstrate that rabies virus has emerged in the Myotis genus independently on multiple occasions and highlights the potential for emergence of new viralhost associations within this genus."}}

Here, we describe a new species of Icaronycteris based on two articulated skeletons discovered in the American Fossil Quarry northwest of Kemmerer, Wyoming. The relative stratigraphic position of these fossils indicates that they are the oldest bat skeletons recovered to date anywhere in the world. Phylogenetic analysis of Eocene fossil bats and living taxa places the new species within the family Icaronycteridae as sister to Icaronycteris index, and additionally indicates that the two Green River archaic bat families (Icaronycteridae and Onychonycteridae) form a clade distinct from known Old World lineages of archaic bats. Our analyses found no evidence that Icaronycteris? menui (France) nor I. sigei (India) belong to this clade; accordingly, we therefore remove them from Icaronycteridae. Taken in sum, our results indicate that Green River bats represent a separate chiropteran radiation of basal bats, and provide additional support for the hypothesis of a rapid radiation of bats on multiple continents during the early Eocene."}}

These three viruses, in addition to two older CoV zoonoses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) are believed to be originally derived from wild bat reservoir species. We review the molecular biology of the bat-derived Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera, highlighting features that contribute to their potential for cross-species emergence, including the use of well-conserved mammalian host cell machinery for cell entry and a unique capacity for adaptation to novel host environments after host switching. The adaptive capacity of coronaviruses largely results from their large genomes, which reduce the risk of deleterious mutational errors and facilitate range-expanding recombination events by offering heightened redundancy in essential genetic material. Large CoV genomes are made possible by the unique proofreading capacity encoded for their RNA-dependent polymerase. We find that bat-borne SARS-related coronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, the source clade for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, present a particularly poignant pandemic threat, due to the extraordinary viral genetic diversity represented among several sympatric species of their horseshoe bat hosts. To date, Sarbecovirus surveillance has been almost entirely restricted to China. More vigorous field research efforts tracking the circulation of Sarbecoviruses specifically and Betacoronaviruses more generally is needed across a broader global range if we are to avoid future repeats of the COVID-19 pandemic."}}

The mouthparts of nymphal and adult A. delacruzi are compatible with scavenging feeding because the hypostome is small and toothless. How a single blood meal of a larva provides energy for several molts as well as for oviposition by females is not known. Adults of A. delacruzi possibly feed upon an unknown food source in bat guano, a substrate on which nymphal and adult stages are always found. Guano produced by insectivorous bats contains twice the amount of protein and 60 times the amount of iron as beef. In addition, bacteria and chitin-rich fungi proliferate on guano. Comparative data on the transcriptome of the salivary glands of A. delacruzi is nonexistent and would help to understand the physiological adaptations of salivary glands that accompany different sources of food as well as the steps taken by the Acari toward haematophagy, believed to have evolved from scavenging dead animals. Annotation of the transcriptome of salivary glands from female instars of A. delacruzi collected on guano categorized 5.7% of the clusters of expressed genes as putative secreted proteins. They included abundantly expressed TIL-domain-containing proteins (possible anti-microbials), an abundantly expressed protein similar to a serum amyloid found in the sialotranscriptomes of Ornithodoros spp., a savignygrin, a family of mucin/peritrophin/cuticle-like proteins, anti-microbials and an HIV envelope-like glycoprotein also found in soft ticks. When comparing the transcriptome of A. delacruzi with those of bloodfeeding female soft and hard ticks some notable differences were observed; they consisted of the following transcripts over- or under-represented or absent in the sialotranscriptome of A. delacruzi that may reﬂect its source of food: ferritin, mucins with chitin-binding domains and TIL-domain-containing proteins versus lipocalins, basic tail proteins, metalloproteases, glycine-rich proteins and Kunitz protease inhibitors, respectively."}}

Until now, there has been no consensus about how landscape degradation affects the diversity and distribution of Neotropical bats. Some studies demonstrate population declines and species loss in impacted areas, although the magnitude and generality of these effects on bat community structure are unclear. Empirical fragmentation thresholds predict an accentuated drop in biodiversity, and species richness in particular, when less than 30% of the original amount of habitat in the landscape remains. In this study, we tested whether bat species richness demonstrates this threshold response, based on 48 sites distributed across 12 landscapes with 9–88% remaining forest in Brazilian cerrado-f­orest formations. We also examined the degree to which abundance was similarly affected within four different feeding guilds. The threshold value for richness, below which bat diversity declines precipitously, was estimated at 47% of remaining forest. To verify if the response of bat abundance to habitat loss differed among feeding guilds, we used a model selection approach based on Akaike’s information criterion. Models accounted for the amount of riparian forest, semideciduous forest, cerrado, tree plantations, secondary forest, and the total amount of forest in the landscape. We demonstrate a nonlinear effect of the contribution of tree plantations to frugivores, and a positive effect of the amount of cerrado to nectarivores and animalivores, the groups that responded most to decreases in amount of forest. We suggest that bat assemblages in interior Atlantic Forest and cerrado regions of southeastern Brazil are impoverished, since we found lower richness and abundance of different groups in landscapes with lower amounts of forest. The relatively higher threshold value of 47% suggests that bat communities have a relatively lower resistance to habitat degradation than other animal groups. Accordingly, conservation and restoration strategies should focus on increasing the amount of native vegetation of landscapes so as to enhance species richness of bats."}}

To explore interactions between pollinators and floral traits of the genus\n              Burmeistera\n              , I filmed floral visitors and measured pollen deposition for 10 species in six cloud forest sites throughout northern Ecuador. Nine species were primarily bat‐pollinated (84–100% of pollen transfer); another (\n              B. rubrosepala\n              ) was exclusively hummingbird‐pollinated. According to a principal components analysis of 11 floral measurements, flowers of\n              B. rubrosepala\n              were morphologically distinct. Floral traits of all species closely matched traditional ornithophilous and chiropterophilous pollination syndromes; flowers of\n              B. rubrosepala\n              were bright red, lacked odor, opened in the afternoon, and had narrow corolla apertures and flexible pedicels, which positioned them below the foliage. Flowers of the bat‐pollinated species were dull‐colored, emitted odor, opened in the evening, and had wide apertures and rigid pedicels, which positioned them beyond the foliage. Aperture width appeared most critical to restricting pollination; hummingbirds visited wide flowers without contacting the reproductive parts, and bats did not visit the narrow flowers of\n              B. rubrosepala\n              . Aperture width may impose an adaptive trade‐off that favors the high degree of specialization in the genus. Other floral measurements were highly variable amongst bat‐pollinated species, including stigma exsertion, calyx lobe morphology, and pedicel length. Because multiple species of\n              Burmeistera\n              often coexist, such morphological diversity may reduce pollen competition by encouraging pollinator fidelity and/or spatially partitioning pollinator's bodies."}}

The distribution of DPP4 in the respiratory tract tissues of humans and camels reflects MERS-CoV tropism. Apart from dromedary camels, insectivorous bats are suggested as another natural reservoir for MERS-like-CoVs. In order to gain insight on the tropism of these viruses in bats, we studied the DPP4 distribution in the respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues of two frugivorous bat species (Epomophorus gambianus and Rousettus aegyptiacus) and two insectivorous bat species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Eptesicus serotinus). In the frugivorous bats, DPP4 was present in epithelial cells of both the respiratory and the intestinal tract, similar to what has been reported for camels and humans. In the insectivorous bats, however, DPP4 expression in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract was almost absent. The preferential expression of DPP4 in the intestinal tract of insectivorous bats, suggests that transmission of MERS-like-CoVs mainly occurs via the fecal-oral route. Our results highlight differences in the distribution of DPP4 expression among MERS-CoV susceptible species, which might influence variability in virus tropism, pathogenesis and transmission route."}}

The hypothesis was tested on an ecologically diverse bat assemblage in northern tropical Australia that consisted of 23 species (5 families, 14 genera). Peak frequency of signals of bats within the echolocation assemblage ranged from 19.8 to 157 kHz but was greatest between 20 and 50 kHz. A strong positive relationship existed between peak call frequency and percentage of moths in the diet for a sample of 16 bats from the assemblage representing 13 genera (R2 = 0.54, p = 0.001). The relationship remained strong when the three species with low-intensity calls were excluded. When the two species with high duty cycle, constant-frequency signals were removed, the relationship was weaker but still significant. In contrast to previous research, eared moths constituted only 54% of moth captures in light traps at bat foraging grounds, and eared moths were significantly larger than non-eared individuals. These results show that the pattern of moth predation by tropical bats is similar to that already established for bat faunas in subtropical and temperate regions."}}

Understanding past responses and extent of niche conservatism in climatic tolerance can help predict future consequences. We use an integrated approach to determine the genetic consequences of past and future climate changes on a bat species, Plecotus austriacus. Glacial refugia predicted by palaeo-modelling match those identiﬁed from analyses of extant genetic diversity and model-based inference of demographic history. Former refugial populations currently contain disproportionately high genetic diversity, but niche conservatism, shifts in suitable areas and barriers to migration mean that these hotspots of genetic diversity are under threat from future climate change. Evidence of population decline despite recent northward migration highlights the need to conserve leading-edge populations for spearheading future range shifts."}}

Habitat diversity was quantified by Simpson's index based on the total areas of five vegetation types on each island. Island area varied over two orders of magnitude (13–1510 km\n              2\n              ) and habitat diversity varied between 1 and 3·7 equivalents of equally abundant habitat types.\n            \n            \n              2.\n               Because the Lesser Antilles consist of an inner arc of high, volcanic islands and an outer arc of low‐lying islands formed of uplifted marine sediments, correlations between area and elevation (\n              r\n              2\n               = 0·32) and between area and habitat diversity (\n              r\n              2\n               = 0·40) were weak. Habitat diversity was, however, strongly correlated with maximum island elevation (\n              r\n              2\n               = 0·85).\n            \n            \n              3.\n               Simple correlations of species richness with island area were significant for all four faunal groups, and simple correlations of species richness with elevation and habitat were significant for all groups except bats. In multiple regressions of species richness on area and habitat diversity together, area was a significant effect for birds and bats, and habitat diversity was a significant effect for birds, butterflies, and reptiles and amphibians.\n            \n            \n              4.\n               These results suggest that the four Lesser Antillean taxonomic groups differ in their responses to area and habitat diversity. For butterflies and for reptiles and amphibians, the relationship of species richness to area is probably a fortuitous consequence of a relationship between habitat diversity and area. Bird species richness responds independently to both habitat diversity and area, and bat species richness is influenced by area but not by habitat diversity.\n            \n            \n              5.\n               We suggest that this variation is related to differences in several biological traits of the different faunal groups. Strong habitat‐diversity effects are likely in taxa with high degrees of habitat specialization, populations large enough to have a low probability of stochastic extinction, life‐cycles that include a resistant resting stage that reduces vulnerability to catastrophic extinction, or a combination of these traits. In contrast, strong area effects are likely in taxa with weak habitat specialization, low population density, or both.\n            \n            \n              6.\n               At least in Lesser Antillean birds, it is unlikely that immigration depends on island size. Therefore, the species–area relationship for birds is probably generated by island‐size‐dependent extinction. Among the four taxonomic groups we studied, only butterflies are likely to show a ‘rescue effect’ stemming from frequent between‐island movement of individuals, as only butterflies exhibited low levels of endemism and lacked a unique area effect for species richness.\n            \n            \n              7.\n               Considered in concert, these taxon‐specific differences demonstrate that both biological characteristics of organisms and geographical features of island groups mediate the relative contribution of island area and habitat diversity to variation in species richness."}}

The model uses parallel bandpass filters spaced over this band to generate envelopes that individually can have much lower bandwidth than the bat’s ultrasonic sonar sounds and still achieve fine delay resolution. Because fine delay separations are inside the integration time of the model’s filters (∼250–300 μs), resolving them means using interference patterns along the frequency dimension (spectral peaks and notches). The low bandwidth content of the filter outputs is suitable for relay of information to higher auditory areas that have intrinsically poor temporal response properties. If implemented in fully parallel analog-digital hardware, the model is computationally extremely efficient and would improve resolution in military and industrial sonar receivers."}}

Using thermal infrared cameras, we identified hot spots along the flanks of free-ranging Brazilian free-tailed bats, ventral to the extended wings. These hot spots are absent in syntopic cave myotis (Myotis velifer), a species that forages over relatively short distances, and does not engage in long-distance migration. We hypothesized that the hot spots, or “radiators,” on Brazilian free-tailed bats may be adaptations for migration, particularly in this long-distance, high-flying species. We examined the vasculature of radiators on Brazilian free-tailed bats with transillumination to characterize the unique arrangements of arteries and veins that are positioned perpendicular to the body in the proximal region of the wing. We hypothesized that these radiators aid in maintaining heat balance by flushing the uninsulated thermal window with warm blood, thereby dissipating heat while bats are flying under warm conditions, but shunting blood away and conserving heat when they are flying in cooler air at high altitudes. We also examined fluid-preserved specimens representing 122 species from 15 of 18 chiropteran families and radiators appeared present only in species in the family Molossidae, including both sedentary and migratory species and subspecies. Thus, the radiator appears to be a unique trait that may facilitate energy balance and water balance during sustained dispersal, foraging, and long-distance migration."}}

This clade of insectivorous bats is widely distributed in the Neotropical Region and has recently gone through a taxonomic update which increased more than twice its diversity. Using six molecular markers of 15 Pteronotus lineages ranging from Mexico to Central Brazil, we reconstruct a time-calibrated tree and infer molecular evolutionary rates for this bat genus. In addition, estimates of range evolution across phylogeny were obtained through statistical model testing among six different biogeographic models. The origin of the genus Pteronotus occurred approximately 16 million years ago (Ma), with initial cladogenesis events being evenly distributed across the phylogeny. Divergence between most closely related species is recent, falling in the Pleistocene period less than 2.6 Ma. Mainland lineages present congruent patterns of north versus south continent splitting while insular clades differ in their time of arrival in the Caribbean Islands. Temporal and geographic range estimates for early nodes of Pteronotus phylogeny suggest a central role of Neogene tectonic reorganizations of Central America in the group diversiﬁcation process. Also, South American colonization by Pteronotus occurred early in the genus history. Founder-event speciation was an important mode of lineage splitting in Pteronotus, with two independent dispersal jumps having occurred to the Greater Antilles. Finally, Pleistocenic sea-level variation and climatic oscillations are possibly associated with divergence between sister-species and recent ages of MRCA for Pteronotus species."}}

This study provides information on the time of emergence and return of an endemic Malagasy fruit bat, Rousettus madagascariensis, in a cave located in the Réserve Spéciale d’Ankarana, northern Madagascar. Individuals were captured in a narrow passage between the roost and cave exit and capture time for each individual was noted. Variation according to sex, age, and body condition, as well as the influence of season, and the sunset and sunrise time were analyzed. During the dry season, individuals started to emerge at 1913 hours and returned to the cave generally by 0505 hours; the duration of time outside the cave during the dry season was higher in adult females (0952 hours) followed by subadult males (0937 hours), sub-adult females (0931 hours), and adult males (0910 hours). During the wet season, individuals exited at 1926 hours and returned at 0351 hours; as in the dry season, adult females spent more time outside the cave (0833 hours), than sub-adult females (0800 hours), and adult males (0752 hours). The period of emergence varied according to the age and sex classes, and time of predawn return associated with the previous nocturnal activity. The period of return was influenced by season, and age and sex classes. Such information is useful to quantify shifts in bat ecology, especially for endemic species with limited distribution or those playing an important role in ecosystem services."}}

In addition to roost sites, there are nectar and fruit sources available in diverse situations across the urban gradient. Phyllostomid bats that thrive in urbanized situations are behaviorally plastic generalists and rely on patches of ornamental or feral plants as food sources. Herein we report on G. soricina and its food sources at an urbanized site in Southeastern Brazil. This small phyllostomid bat consumes nectar from landscaping ornamental plants, besides consuming the soft pulp along with the tiny seeds of pioneer trees and shrubs. In addition to these natural sources, the bat exploits hummingbird feeders to consume the sugared water. Ingested small seeds are defecated in flight, the bat acting as a disperser of pioneer plants that favor cleared areas. Glossophaga soricina role as flower-pollinator and seed-disperser at Neotropical urban areas merits further attention due both to the maintenance of urban biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services."}}

Our objectives were to determine winter roost use by tricolored bats in an area devoid of subterranean roosts, determine roost microclimates to relate them to growth requirements of the fungal causal agent of WNS, and determine habitat factors influencing winter tree selection. From November to March 2017–2019, we used radiotelemetry to track 15 bats to their day roosts in the upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina and recorded microclimates in accessible tree cavities and bridges. We also characterized habitat and tree characteristics of 24 used trees and 153 random, available trees and used discrete choice models to determine selection. Roost structures included I-beam bridges, cavities in live trees, and foliage. Bridges were warmer and less humid than cavities. Roost temperatures often were amenable to fungal growth (&lt; 19.5°C) but fluctuated widely depending on ambient temperatures. Bats used bridges on colder days (8.7°C ± 5.0 SD) and trees on warmer days (11.3°C ± 5.4). Bats selected low-decay trees closer to streams in areas with high canopy closure and cavity abundance. Bats also appeared to favor hardwood forests and avoid pine forests. Our results suggest that access to multiple roost microclimates might be important for tricolored bats during winter, and forest management practices that retain live trees near streams and foster cavity formation in hardwood forests likely will benefit this species. Our results also suggest tricolored bats using bridge and tree roosts might be less susceptible to WNS than bats using subterranean hibernaculum roosts. Thus, forests in areas without subterranean hibernacula in the southeastern United States that support bats during winter might represent important refugia from WNS for multiple species."}}

Allen, 1864)) in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta to test the hypothesis that different costs of torpor result in different patterns of thermoregulation and roosting behaviour for reproductive and nonreproductive females. We radio-tracked bats to monitor body temperatures and locate roosts. We took roost measurements and inserted temperature data loggers to measure roost microclimate. Bats entered torpor frequently, but nonreproductive females spent longer periods in torpor, had lower minimum body temperatures, and entered deep torpor more often than reproductive females did, supporting the hypothesis that entering torpor is more costly for reproductive individuals. Roosts were located mainly in rock fields on steep, open, south-facing slopes. Reproductive females roosted in crevices between rocks located above or on the surface of the ground. Roosts warmed rapidly and reached warm daytime temperatures. Females roosted alone during pregnancy but formed small colonies within roosts during lactation when ambient conditions were cooler. Clustering may reduce thermoregulatory costs for both adults and young. Nonreproductive females roosted mainly alone in crevices in the ground. These roosts had cooler, more stable microclimates, allowing females to enter deeper bouts of torpor and remain torpid longer."}}

More than 80% of the energy consumed during flight generates heat as a by-product, and thus it is expected that bat wings should dissipate large amounts of heat to prevent hyperthermia. We measured rectal (Tr) and surface (Ts) temperatures of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) as they emerged from and returned to their daytime roosts and calculated sensible heat transfer for different body regions (head, body, wings, and tail membrane). Bats’ Tr decreased from 36.8°C during emergence flights to 34.4°C during returns, and Ts scaled positively with ambient temperature (Ta). Total radiative heat loss from bats was significantly greater for a radiative sink to the night sky than for a sink with temperature equal to Ta. We found that free-ranging Brazilian free-tailed bats, on average, do not dissipate heat from their wings by convection but instead dissipate radiative heat (L) to the cloudless night sky during flight ( W). However, within the range of Ta measured in this study, T. brasiliensis experienced net heat loss between evening emergence and return flights. Regional hypothermia reduces heat loss from wings that are exposed to potentially high convective fluxes. Additional research is needed to establish the role of wings in evaporative cooling during flight in bats."}}

Here I review developments categorised broadly into six headings: measuring diversity among individuals; inbreeding; selection and drift; identiﬁcation of individuals; measuring diﬀerentiation (demes, populations, MUs, ESUs, species, hybrids); and other molecular biological approaches.

Hunting at the roost is prohibited at Berenty but P. rufus is trapped at night in the area surrounding the reserve, where it feeds on sisal. At Amborabao, the bats roost in a sacred forest and hunting is forbidden. At Sainte Luce, the forest is highly degraded and the bats are hunted frequently, despite efforts to engage the local community in forest conservation. Questionnaires with people living near the roosts revealed the flying foxes were regarded as pests of litchis in Amborabao and Sainte Luce. Berenty is the only site where tourists are able to observe roosting P. rufus. The role of sacred forests and local taboos (fady) is very relevant for P. rufus conservation and might be the only practical mechanism in sites where legislation on hunting and land use is not being enforced."}}

Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of  a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions may occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as  the A/H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e., the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (in particular blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases."}}

Much wildlife health work focuses on the detection and response to infectious or parasitic diseases; this perspective has been reinforced by the focus of the One Health initiative on wildlife as sources of emerging infections. The definition of health as “the absence of disease” lags 70 yr behind modern concepts of human health and emerging concepts of wildlife health in terms of vulnerability, resilience, and sustainability. Policies, programs, and research that focus on the integration of wildlife health with natural resource conservation, ecosystem restoration, and public health need a working definition of health that recognizes the major threats to fish and wildlife are the result of many other drivers besides pathogens and parasites, including habitat loss, globalization of trade, land-use pressure, and climate change. A modern definition of wildlife health should emphasize that 1) health is the result of interacting biologic, social, and environmental determinants that interact to affect capacity to cope with change; 2) health cannot be measured solely by what is absent but rather by characteristics of the animals and their ecosystem that affect their vulnerability and resilience; and 3) wildlife health is not a biologic state but rather a dynamic social construct based on human expectations and knowledge."}}

We investigated use of torpor by free-ranging adult male pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) at the northern limit of their range in the semiarid Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, Canada. We predicted that males would use torpor frequently during the active season and that ambient temperature (Ta) as well as nutritional condition (body condition index [BCI]) would affect torpor use. We expected roost microclimate to be conducive to daily heterothermy given that roosts had cool morning temperatures that increased in the afternoon. We used temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters to measure skin temperature (Tskin) of 8 bats from June to August 2003. Seven individuals used torpor each day (n ¼ 54 tracking days) but not at night. Torpor duration increased as mean daytime Ta decreased albeit the relationship differed between individuals. There was no signiﬁcant effect of individual on the relationship between minimum Tskin during torpor and Ta. BCI was signiﬁcantly and inversely correlated with torpor bout duration. Mean daytime temperatures in rock crevice roosts approached 308C and ﬂuctuated less than Ta."}}

We conducted a field experiment to investigate how sickness behavior affects individual connectedness over time using a dynamic social network created from high-resolution proximity data. After capturing adult female vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from a roost, we created “sick” bats by injecting a random half of bats with the immune-challenging substance, lipopolysaccharide, while the control group received saline injections. Over the next 3 days, we used proximity sensors to continuously track dyadic associations between 16 “sick” bats and 15 control bats under natural conditions. Compared to control bats, “sick” bats associated with fewer bats, spent less time near others, and were less socially connected to more well-connected individuals (sick bats had on average a lower degree, strength, and eigenvector centrality). High-resolution proximity data allow researchers to flexibly define network connections (association rates) based on how a particular pathogen is transmitted (e.g., contact duration of &gt;1 vs. &gt;60 min, contact proximity of &lt;1 vs. &lt;10 m). Therefore, we inspected how different ways of measuring association rates changed the observed effect of LPS. How researchers define association rates influences the magnitude and detectability of sickness effects on network centrality. When animals are sick, they often encounter fewer individuals. We tracked this unintentional “social distancing” effect hour-by-hour in a wild colony of vampire bats. Using bat-borne proximity sensors, we compared changes in the social network connectedness of immune-challenged “sick” bats versus “control” bats over time. “Sick” bats had fewer encounters with others and spent less time near others. Associations changed dramatically by time of day, and different measures of association influenced the sickness effect estimates."}}

Some studies suggested that bats became nocturnal because of overheating when flying in daylight. This is because—in contrast to feathered wings of birds—dark and naked wing membranes of bats efficiently absorb short-wave solar radiation. We hypothesized that bats face elevated flight costs during daylight flights, since we expected them to alter wing-beat kinematics to reduce heat load by solar radiation. To test this assumption, we measured metabolic rate and body temperature during short flights in the tropical short-tailed fruit bat\n              Carollia perspicillata\n              at night and during the day. Core body temperature of flying bats differed by no more than 2°C between night and daytime flights, whereas mass-specific CO\n              2\n              production rates were higher by 15 per cent during daytime. We conclude that increased flight costs only render diurnal bat flights profitable when the relative energy gain during daytime is high and risk of predation is low. Ancestral bats possibly have evolved dark-skinned wing membranes to reduce nocturnal predation, but a low degree of reflectance of wing membranes made them also prone to overheating and elevated energy costs during daylight flights. In consequence, bats may have become trapped in the darkness of the night once dark-skinned wing membranes had evolved."}}

Tropical high-altitude alpine and montane forest ecosystems and their biodiversity are particularly sensitive to temperature increases under climate change, but they are also subject to accelerated pressures from land conversion and degradation due to a growing human population. We studied the combined effects of anthropogenic land-use change, past and future climate changes and mountain range isolation on the endemic Ethiopian Highlands long-eared bat, Plecotus balensis, an understudied bat that is restricted to the remnant natural high-altitude Afroalpine and Afromontane habitats. We integrated ecological niche modelling, landscape genetics and model-based inference to assess the genetic, geographic and demographic impacts of past and recent environmental changes. We show that mountain range isolation and historic climates shaped population structure and patterns of genetic variation, but recent anthropogenic land-use change and habitat degradation are associated with a severe population decline and loss of genetic diversity. Models predict that the suitable niche of this bat has been progressively shrinking since the last glaciation period. This study highlights threats to Afroalpine and Afromontane biodiversity, squeezed to higher altitudes under climate change while losing genetic diversity and suffering population declines due to anthropogenic land-use change. We conclude that the conservation of tropical montane biodiversity requires a holistic approach, using genetic, ecological and geographic information to understand the effects of environmental changes across temporal scales and simultaneously addressing the impacts of multiple threats."}}

We quantified the value and benefit distribution of bat pollination in the production of a major fruit crop in Mexico (pitayas, Stenocereus queretaroensis). We used exclusion experiments to quantify the effect of bat pollinators on crop yield and quality. We then used yield analysis to assess the market value of pollination services, combined with value chain analysis to assess the distribution of these economic benefits among actors. Bat pollination services to pitaya production are worth approximately US$2,500 per ha through increases in both fruit yield and size, with bats contributing around 40% of gross income across producers. Participation in the pitaya value chain provides a key seasonal source of cash income at a time of low agricultural activity, supporting livelihoods and household activities of the rural poor. However, the commercialisation of the pitaya has concentrated economic benefits with privileged groups who have access to land and markets. Our novel approach to valuing pollination services is transferable to other crops and pollinator species to demonstrate disaggregated socio-economic consequences of losing pollinators."}}

Habitat suitability modelling has been used traditionally to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution but can also be applied to address conservation needs at ﬁner scales. We studied the ability of presence-only species distribution modelling to predict patterns of habitat selection at broad and ﬁne spatial scales for one of the rarest mammals in the UK, the grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus). Models were constructed with Maxent using broad-scale distribution data from across the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) and ﬁne-scale radio-tracking data from bats at one colony. Fine-scale model predictions were evaluated with radio-tracking locations from bats from a distant colony, and compared with results of traditional radio-tracking data analysis methods (compositional analysis of habitat selection). Broad-scale models indicated that winter temperature, summer precipitation and land cover were the most important variables limiting the distribution of the grey long-eared bat in the UK. Fine-scale models predicted that proximity to unimproved grasslands and distance to suburban areas determine foraging habitat suitability around maternity colonies, while compositional analysis also identiﬁed unimproved grasslands as the most preferred foraging habitat type. This strong association with unimproved lowland grasslands highlights the potential importance of changes in agricultural practices in the past century for wildlife conservation. Hence, multi-scale models offer an important tool for identifying conservation requirements at the ﬁne landscape level that can guide national-level conservation management practices."}}

These pathogens are occasionally transmitted from bats to wildlife, livestock, and to humans, directly or through other bridging (intermediate) hosts. Due to their public health relevance, zoonotic viruses are a primary focus of research attention. In contrast, other emerging pathogens of bats, such as bacteria, are vastly understudied despite their ubiquity and diversity. Here, we describe the currently known host ranges and geographic distributional patterns of potentially zoonotic bacterial genera in bats, using published presence-absence data of pathogen occurrence. We identify apparent gaps in our understanding of the distribution of these pathogens on a global scale. The most frequently detected bacterial genera in bats are Bartonella, Leptospira, and Mycoplasma. However, a wide variety of other potentially zoonotic bacterial genera are also occasionally found in bats, such as Anaplasma, Brucella, Borrelia, Coxiella, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Neorickettsia, and Rickettsia. The bat families Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Pteropodidae are most frequently reported as hosts of bacterial pathogens; however, the presence of at least one bacterial genus was confirmed in all 15 bat families tested. On a spatial scale, molecular diagnostics of samples from 58 countries and four overseas departments and island states (French Guiana, Mayotte, New Caledonia, and Réunion Island) reported testing for at least one bacterial pathogen in bats. We also identified geographical areas that have been mostly neglected during bacterial pathogen research in bats, such as the Afrotropical region and Southern Asia. Current knowledge on the distribution of potentially zoonotic bacterial genera in bats is strongly biased by research effort towards certain taxonomic groups and geographic regions. Identifying these biases can guide future surveillance efforts, contributing to a better understanding of the ecoepidemiology of zoonotic pathogens in bats."}}

Movements between traps and roost sites were normally about 1 km, with the maximum distance recorded being 4.8 km for a female N. geoffroyi. Different species of eucalypts were used as roost sites in proportion to their occurrence in the forest. However, large trees over 80 cm d.b.h. were favoured. There was no tendency to avoid roost sites close to the ground. Spaces used as roost sites had one dimension little greater than the bat itself. Five types of roost sites were distinguished: in fissures, inside burnt-out boles, in hollows, under bark and on the ground. Individuals changed roost sites frequently but roosts used by any one individual were in the same general vicinity. The factors associated with production of roost sites in trees were: large size, overmaturity, death, rot and fire. No bats were found to roost in regenerated forest. Patches of mature forest will need to be retained to ensure a shortage of roosts does not occur as more areas of mature forest are converted to production forest."}}

An assumed linear increase of fatalities with installed capacity would expand my estimate of bat fatalities across the USA from 0.89 million in 2012 to 1.11 million in 2014 and to 1.72 million in 2019. However, this assumed linear relationship could have been invalidated by shifts in turbine size, tower height, fatality search interval during monitoring, and regional variation in bat fatalities. I tested for eﬀects of these factors in fatality monitoring reports through 2014. I found no signiﬁcant relationship between bat fatality rates and wind turbine size. Bat fatality rates increased with increasing tower height, but this increase mirrored the increase in fatality rates with shortened fatality search intervals that accompanied the increase in tower heights. Regional weighting of mean project-level bat fatalities increased the national-level estimate 17% to 1.3 (95% CI: 0.15–3.0) million. After I restricted the estimate’s basis to project-level fatality rates that were estimated from fatality search intervals <10 days, my estimate increased by another 71% to 2.22 (95% CI: 1.77–2.72) million bat fatalities in the USA’s lower 48 states in 2014. Project-level fatality estimates based on search intervals <10 days were, on average, eight times higher than estimates based on longer search intervals. Shorter search intervals detected more small-bodied species, which contributed to a larger all-bat fatality estimate."}}

We determined the δ13C and δ15N for cave crickets, cockroaches, spiders, guano of a hematophagous bat, and leaf litter found on the ground near the cave entrance. The δ13C and δ15N for the cricket and cockroaches showed that bat guano was not the only food item for these arthropods. They had intermediate δ13C and δ15N between bat guano and leaf litter, which means that they consumed additional food resources other than guano in their diet, independent of distribution of guano deposits in the cave.The spiders, predators with great mobility, seemed to not have a preferential diet item since their isotope signals indicated they hunt both crickets and cockroaches. The δ13C of the bat guano (−15.4‰) indicated that the diet of these hematophagous bats relied on animals fed with C4 plants. The conversion of native savanna vegetation of which the debris is mostly from C3 plants, to pasture, based on C4 African grass, a remarkably common land use transformation in the region, is indirectly inﬂuencing the diet of hematophagous bats, which basically relied on exotic fauna. The C and N stable isotope ratios showed that the arthropods inside the cave do not rely solely on bat guano for their diet, but interact directly with the external environment, through litter debris, indicating a signiﬁcant exchange of energy and matter between the cave environment and the surrounding area."}}

Speciation and TE activity bursts could be strongly related in mammals, in which simple gradualistic models of differentiation do not account for the currently observed species variability. In order to test this hypothesis, we designed two parameters: the Density of insertion (DI) and the Relative rate of speciation (RRS). DI is the ratio between the number of TE insertions in a genome and its size, whereas the RRS is a conditional parameter designed to identify potential speciation bursts. Thus, by analyzing TE insertions in mammals, we defined the genomes as “hot” (high DI) and “cold” (low DI). Then, comparing TE activity among 29 taxonomical families of the whole Mammalia class, 16 intra-order pairs of mammalian species, and four superorders of Eutheria, we showed that taxa with high rates of speciation are associated with “hot” genomes, whereas taxa with low ones are associated with “cold” genomes. These results suggest a remarkable correlation between TE activity and speciation, also being consistent with patterns describing variable rates of differentiation and accounting for the different time frames of the speciation bursts."}}

Further increasing temperatures and aridity might consequently exceed their thermoregulatory capacities. Here, we describe two novel modes of torpor, a response usually associated with cold or resource bottlenecks, as efficient mechanisms to counter heat. We conducted a field study on the Malagasy bat Macronycteris commersoni resting in foliage during the hot season, unprotected from environmental extremes. On warm days, the bats alternated between remarkably short micro-torpor bouts and normal resting metabolism within a few minutes. On hot days, the bats extended their torpor bouts over the hottest time of the day while tolerating body temperatures up to 42.9°C. Adaptive hyperthermia combined with lowered metabolic heat production from torpor allows higher heat storage from the environment, negates the need for evaporative cooling and thus increases heat tolerance. However, it is a high-risk response as the torpid bats cannot defend body temperature if ambient temperature increases above a critical/lethal threshold. Torpor coupled with hyperthermia and micro-torpor bouts broaden our understanding of the basic principles of thermal physiology and demonstrate how mammals can perform near their upper thermal limits in an increasingly warmer world."}}

We performed ridge regressions predicting mortality and infection as a function of traits, phylogenetic eigenvectors and separately host receptor sequences. We found that mortality from Ebolavirus had a strong association to life history characteristics and phylogeny. In contrast, infection status related not just to life history and phylogeny, but also to fruit consumption which suggests that geographic overlap of frugivorous mammals can lead to spread of virus in the wild. Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) receptor sequences predicted infection statuses of bats included in our study with very high accuracy, suggesting that characterizing NPC1 in additional species is a promising avenue for future work. We combine the predictions from our mortality and infection status models to differentiate between species that are infected and also die from Ebolavirus versus species that are infected but tolerate the virus (possible reservoirs of Ebolavirus). We therefore present the first comprehensive estimates of Ebolavirus reservoir statuses for all known terrestrial mammals in Africa."}}

N. lasiopterus keeps to opportunistic foraging by using easily accessible and properly sized food objects. Having analyzed 129 fecal samples, we singled out 10 categories of food objects belonging to six orders of insects. The representatives of Lepidoptera constitute the major part of the ration. Their abundance rates undergo asynchronous changes relative to each other. Homoptera and Neuroptera are found more rarely in the feces. Orthoptera and Diptera are extremely rare. Besides insects, bird feathers were found in 14 faecal samples of N. lasiopterus. They made up from 60 to 90% of the total fecal mass."}}

Due to this characteristic they play a relevant ecological role in the niches they inhabit. These mammals spread infectious diseases from enzootic to domestic foci. Rabbies, SARS, fungi, ebola and trypanosomes are the most common pathogens these animals may host. We conducted intensive sampling of bats from the phyllostomidae, vespertilionidae and emballonuridae families in six localities from Casanare department in eastern Colombia. Blood-EDTA samples were obtained and subsequently submitted to analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers in order to conduct barcoding analyses to discriminate trypanosome species. The ﬁndings according to the congruence of the three molecular markers suggest the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi (51%), T. c. marinkellei (9%), T. dionisii (13%), T. rangeli (21%), T. evansi (4%) and T. theileri (2%) among 107 positive bat specimens. Regarding the T. cruzi DTUs, we observed the presence of TcI (60%), TcII (15%), TcIII (7%), TcIV (7%) and TcBAT (11%) being the ﬁrst evidence to our concern of the foreseen genotype TcBAT in Colombia. These results allowed us to propose reliable hypotheses regarding the ecology and biology of the bats circulating in the area including the enigmatic question whether TcBAT should be considered a novel DTU. The epidemiological and evolutionary implications of these ﬁndings are herein discussed."}}

The current study investigates an ascending right turn of a\n              Hipposideros pratti\n              bat and elucidates on the kinematic features and aerodynamic mechanisms used to effectuate the manoeuvre. The wing kinematics captured by a three-dimensional motion capture system is used as the boundary condition for the aerodynamic simulations featuring immersed boundary method. Results indicate that the bat uses roll and yaw rotations of the body to different extents synergistically to generate the centripetal force to initiate and sustain the turn. The turning moments are generated by drawing the wing inside the turn closer to the body, by introducing phase lags in force generation between the wings and redirecting force production to the outer part of the wing outside of the turn. Deceleration in flight speed, an increase in flapping frequency, shortening of the upstroke and thrust generation at the end of the upstroke were observed during the ascending manoeuvre. The bat consumes about 0.67 W power to execute the turning-ascending manoeuvre, which is approximately two times the power consumed by similar bats during level flight. Upon comparison with a similar manoeuvre by a\n              Hipposideros armiger\n              bat (Windes\n              et al\n              . 2020\n              Bioinspir.

For many European species, the Mediterranean peninsulas of Iberia, Italy and the Balkans acted as glacial refugia and the source of range recolonization, and as a result, they contain disproportionately high levels of diversity. As these areas are particularly threatened by future climate change, it is important to understand how past climatic changes affected their biodiversity. We use an integrated approach, combining markers with different evolutionary rates and combining phylogenetic analysis with approximate Bayesian computation and species distribution modelling across temporal scales. We relate phylogeographic processes to patterns of genetic variation in Myotis escalerai, a bat species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We found a distinct population structure at the mitochondrial level with a strong geographic signature, indicating lineage divergence into separate glacial refugia within the Iberian refugium. However, microsatellite markers suggest higher levels of gene ﬂow resulting in more limited structure at recent time frames. The evolutionary history of M. escalerai was shaped by the effects of climatic oscillations and changes in forest cover and composition, while its future is threatened by climatically induced range contractions and the role of ecological barriers due to competition interactions in restricting its distribution. This study warns that Mediterranean peninsulas, which provided refuge for European biodiversity during past glaciation events, may become a trap for limited dispersal and ecologically limited endemic species under future climate change, resulting in loss of entire lineages."}}

Despite this, roosting ecology of bats is poorly understood and much of the basic information is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the availability and occupation patterns of four roost types (trees, caves, termite nests and tents) used by bats at Tirimbina Biological Reserve (TBR), Costa Rica. To accomplish our aim, we systematically surveyed both sides of established trails and transects, looking for understory roosts. Potential roosts were examined for bat presence in order to establish occupation. Roost availability and density were estimated using traveled distances (km) and inspected area (10 m for trees/caves and 15 m for tents/termite nests) of each trail or transect sampled. For the tent roosts, data on taxonomic information of plant modified, type of architecture, condition and construction achievement were also recorded. The area surveyed represented 45.4 % of the total area of the TBR (345 ha). Tents were the most common roost (56.6 % of all roosts, N = 223), followed by trees (24.4 %, N = 96), termite nests (18.8 %, N = 74) and caves (0.2 %, N = 1). We detected only 27 roosts occupied by bats (6.8 % of all roosts, 0.17 occupied roosts/ha). Caves showed the highest occupation rate (100 %, N = 1), followed by trees (17.7 %, N = 17), tents (3.6 %, N = 8) and termite nests (1.3 %, N = 1). We found the roosts for 10 species, representing 33.9 % of the bat fauna documented at the reserve (62 species). Density of roosts per bat species varied between 0.017-0.138 roosts/ha. Phyllostomidae was the best-represented family with Micronycteris microtis representing the most common species encountered. Four distinct tent architectures were documented. Bifid architecture was the most common (133 tents), followed by Conical (47 tents), Apical (27 tents) and Inverted Boat (16 tents). Most of the tents found were healthy (76.7 %, N = 171) and totally constructed (88.8 %, N = 198). Our study demonstrated that occupied bat roosts are difficult to find in the forest. When compared to the roost availability, the low occupation rates suggested that, at least in our study area, roosts might not be a limiting resource. Nevertheless, to confirm this hypothesis, information about fidelity and selection process of the species is fundamental for understanding to what extent these roosts meet the requirements to be inhabited or modified. Worldwide conservation efforts on bats should focus on understanding roosting ecology, especially due to anthropogenic pressures that are continuously reducing the availability of roosts, which undoubtedly contributes to the risk of extinction for specialized and sensitive species.

During the summers of 2001 to 2004 we conducted fieldwork in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, situated on the northern end of Colorado's Front Range, to address questions of roost selection by the big brown bat (\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              ). The city has experienced its greatest growth in the past half century, with its population increasing by 30% in the last decade. Similar growth in new buildings has occurred, with the number of new housing permits issued annually doubling in the past decade. We located 142 roosts using radiotelemetry or by citizen calls in response to a newspaper article and flyers. To determine characteristics of roost selectivity by bats, we compared variables for known maternity roosts and randomly selected buildings at microhabitat and landscape scales using logistic regression; we used an information theoretic approach to determine which variables were most important. We considered 44 and 100 buildings in the microhabitat and landscape scale analyses, respectively. At the microhabitat scale maternity roosts had exit points with larger areas that were higher from the ground and had warmer average temperatures than randomly selected buildings. At the landscape scale distances to similarly categorized roosts were smaller, and urbanization variables such as lower building density, higher street density, and lower traffic count density were most important. Results for variables important to urban‐roosting big brown bats were often analogous to studies that characterized maternity roosts found in tree snags and rock crevices. In addition, changes in the landscape, not only in the form of anthropogenic structures but also in water availability and vegetation structure such as riparian forests, may have led to population increases and range expansions of the big brown bat. Because big brown bats appear to selectively choose specific combinations of characteristics found at maternity roosts, not all available structures can be considered suitable and exclusion from established maternity roosts may negatively impact bat populations."}}

In this study, we aimed to contribute to the understanding and conservation of the bat fauna of the Pasuncha region (Pacho, Cundinamarca, Colombia) by making a species inventory, installing artificial shelters as a conservation strategy, and implementing education programs addressing human-bat interaction. We recorded eight species for the region: Artibeus lituratus, Carollia brevicaudum, Carollia castanea, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira erythromos (fruit eaters); Glossophaga soricina (nectarivorous-polynivorous); Eptesicus brasliensis (insectivore), and Desmodus rotundus (sanguinivorous). We found C. brevicaudum, C. perspicillata, and G. soricina using abandoned houses as refuges and measured the basic population characteristics of the species at the Roble & Nogal reserve. Based on the biotic and abiotic information, we designed, built, and installed a bat box for fruit eaters and nectarivorous-polynivorous species. We also implemented an environmental education project focused on citizen science to encourage changes in the community’s perceptions and behavior toward bats whose results were reflected in a series of illustrative brochures produced jointly with the community."}}

Yet, the combination of different sources of demographic data into one statistical model holds promise. We applied Bayesian integrated population modeling to demographic data from a colony of the endangered greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). Available data were the number of subadults and adults emerging from the colony roost at dusk, the number of newborns from 1991 to 2005, and recapture data of subadults and adults from 2004 and 2005. Survival rates did not differ between sexes, and demographic rates remained constant across time. The greater horseshoe bat is a long-lived species with high survival rates ( first year: 0.49 [SD 0.06]; adults: 0.91 [SD 0.02]) and low fecundity (0.74 [SD 0.12]). The yearly average population growth was 4.4% (SD 0.1%) and there were 92 (SD 10) adults in the colony in year 2005. Had we analyzed each data set separately, we would not have been able to estimate fecundity, the estimates of survival would have been less precise, and the estimate of population growth biased. Our results demonstrate that integrated models are suitable for obtaining crucial demographic information from limited data."}}

Because of its noninvasive and less time-consuming nature, many studies of recent years solely rely on this information to establish a species inventory. eDNA metabarcoding has been shown to be an efficient method in aquatic ecosystems, especially for fish. However, detection efficiency is not clear for mammals. Using the existing literature, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate if eDNA metabarcoding allows greater detection success compared to conventional surveys (such as field surveys, camera traps, etc.). Although only 28 articles were retrieved, showing the lack of comparative studies, still representing more than 900 taxa detected, we found that detection success was method dependent, but most importantly varies on the taxonomy of the targeted taxa. eDNA metabarcoding performed poorly for bats compared to the traditional mist nests. However, strong detection overlaps were found between conventional surveys and eDNA for large-bodied mammals such as ungulates, primates, and carnivores. Overall, we argue that using both molecular and field approaches can complement each other and can maximize the most accurate biodiversity assessment and there is much room for metabarcoding optimization to reach their full potential compared to traditional surveys."}}

We use resampling to show the variation in species accumulation curves caused by the order of trapping periods. Averaged species accumulation curves calculated by randomly assigning the order of trapping periods are smooth curves that are a better estimate of species richness and a more useful tool for determining the trapping effort required to adequately survey a site. We extend this concept of randomly resampling the trapping period to show that randomizing the number of individuals caught for each species over the number of collection periods (e.g. days) can provide an accurate estimate of the averaged species accumulation curve. This is particularly useful as it enables an accurate estimation of the proportion of the total number of species caught in an area during a survey from information on the number of individuals caught for each species and the number of trapping periods, and is not dependent on having knowledge of the trapping period in which each individual was caught. This calculation also enables an assessment to be made of the adequacy of fauna surveys to report a species inventory in environmental impact assessments when only a species list and relative abundance data are provided."}}

Seroprevalence was higher in adult females (17.9%, n = 2,332) than males (9.4%, n = 128; P = 0.007) or volant juveniles (10.2%, n = 738; P<0.0001). Seroprevalence was lowest in a drought year with local insecticide use and highest in the year with normal conditions, suggesting that environmental stress may suppress RVNA production in big brown bats. Seroprevalence also increased with age of bat, and varied from 6.2 to 26.7% among adult females at five roosts sampled each year for five years. Seroprevalence of adult females at 17 other roosts sampled for 1 to 4 years ranged from 0.0 to 47.1%. Using logistic regression, the only ranking model in our candidate set of explanatory variables for serological status at first sampling included year, day of season, and a year by day of season interaction that varied with relative drought conditions. The presence or absence of antibodies in individual bats showed temporal variability. Year alone provided the best model to explain the likelihood of adult female bats showing a transition to seronegative from a previously seropositive state. Day of the season was the only competitive model to explain the likelihood of a transition from seronegative to seropositive, which increased as the season progressed. We found no rabies viral RNA in oropharyngeal secretions of 261 seropositive bats or in organs of 13 euthanized seropositive bats. Survival of seropositive and seronegative bats did not differ. The presence of RVNA in serum of bats should not be interpreted as evidence for ongoing rabies infection."}}

This forest presents remarkable climatic variation throughout the year, especially in precipitation. This variation makes it necessary for the animals that live here to adapt according mainly to food availability. We analyze a bat assemblage in terms of its species richness and guild composition in an agro dry forest landscape. We describe how the presence, abundance and guilds of different bat species varies through time and closely relates to rainfall pattern, distinctly affecting nectarivorous, frugivorous, insectivorous or hematophagous. We propose that the species that make up the assemblage of bats at this site probably make local movements periodically, using the area only temporarily. We emphasize that, given the movement of species during the year, the maintenance of natural elements such as forest patches and wetlands within ago-landscapes is mandatory in order to achieve a regional conservation strategies."}}

Stressors from unsustainable human land use changes are suspected to dramatically exacerbate the probability of zoonotic spillover of pathogens from their natural reservoir hosts to humans, both by increasing viral load (and shedding) and the interface between wildlife with livestock, pets and humans. Given their known role as reservoir hosts, bats continue to be investigated for their possible role as the origins of many viral outbreaks. However, the participation of bat-associated ectoparasites in the spread of potential pathogens requires further work to establish. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of viruses, viral genes and other viral sequences obtained from bat ectoparasites from studies over the last four decades. This review summarizes research ﬁndings of the seven virus families in which these studies have been performed, including Paramyxoviridae, Reoviridae, Flaviviridae, Peribunyaviridae, Nairoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Filoviridae. We highlight that bat ectoparasites, including dipterans and ticks, are often found to have medically important viruses and may have a role in the maintenance of these pathogens within bat populations."}}

Assessing genotyping success and genetic variability in three mouse-eared bat species from non-invasive genetic sampling","journal_title":"Hystrix, the Italian Journal of Mammalogy","journal_volume":"27","journal_issue":"2","journal_pages":"150–157","description":"In the last century bat populations signiﬁcantly declined mainly due to habitat fragmentation and degradation. As management-dependent species, bats need appropriate monitoring programs for the implementation of sound conservation strategies. However, bats’ small size, high mobility, elusiveness and nocturnal lifestyle make them diﬃcult to survey. Non-Invasive Genetic Sampling (NIGS) may oﬀer safe and cost-eﬀective solutions, but requires well-planned sampling strategies, informative molecular markers and reliable laboratory protocols. Here we developed a NIGS protocol for species and individual identiﬁcation of three mouse-eared bats, the Geoﬀroy’s bat ( Myotis emarginatus), the long-ﬁngered bat (Myotis capaccinii) and the Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii). Species identiﬁcation was accomplished by mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequencing of reference tissue (n=49) and droppings (n=285) from Central-Northern Italy. In addition, we optimized a multiplex panel of seven microsatellites suitable for species and individual identiﬁcation of the three species from droppings. We obtained a good success with mtDNA sequencing (245/285; 86%) and microsatellite genotyping (129/245; 53%). All microsatellites were successfully ampliﬁed with low error rates, and were polymorphic in the three Myotis species, with probabilities of identity 0.001 and observed heterozygosities of Ho=0.48 in M. emarginatus, 0.62 in M. capaccinii and 0.71 in M. daubentonii. Our protocol represents a useful tool for population genetic studies on mouse-eared bats that could likely be extended to other bat species and provide useful information to implement eﬀective conservation plans."}}

Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi- Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.</p></section>"}}

However, the modes of transmission, the level of viral replication, tissue tropism and viral shedding pattern remains to be described. Captive-bred R. aegyptiacus, including adult males, females and pups were exposed to MARV by different inoculation routes. Blood, tissues, feces and urine from 9 bats inoculated by combination of nasal and oral routes were all negative for the virus and ELISA IgG antibody could not be demonstrated for up to 21 days post inoculation (p.i.). In 21 bats inoculated by a combination of intraperitoneal/subcutaneous route, viremia and the presence of MARV in different tissues was detected on days 2-9 p.i., and IgG antibody on days 9-21 p.i. In 3 bats inoculated subcutaneously, viremia was detected on days 5 and 8 (termination of experiment), with virus isolation from different organs. MARV could not be detected in urine, feces or oral swabs in any of the 3 experimental groups. However, it was detected in tissues which might contribute to horizontal or vertical transmission, e.g. lung, intestines, kidney, bladder, salivary glands, and female reproductive tract. Viremia lasting at least 5 days could also facilitate MARV mechanical transmission by blood sucking arthropods and infections of susceptible vertebrate hosts by direct contact with infected blood. All bats were clinically normal and no gross pathology was identified on post mortem examination. This work confirms the susceptibility of R. aegyptiacus to infection with MARV irrespective of sex and age and contributes to establishing a bat-filovirus experimental model. Further studies are required to uncover the mode of MARV transmission, and to investigate the putative role of R. aegyptiacus as a reservoir host."}}

We compared pinna gain, directionality of hearing and interaural intensity differences (IID) in echolocating and non-echolocating bats, in species using different echolocation strategies and in species that depend upon prey-generated sounds to locate their targets. In the Pteropodidae, two echolocating species had slightly higher directionality than a non-echolocating species. The ears of phyllostomid and vespertilionid species showed moderate directionality. In the Mormoopidae, the ear directionality of Pteronotus parnellii clearly matched the dominant spectral component of its echolocation calls, unlike the situation in three other species. Species in the Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Rhinopomatidae and two vespertilionids that use narrow-band search-phase echolocation calls showed increasingly sharp tuning of the pinna to the main frequency of their signals. Similar tuning was most evident in Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae, species specialized for ﬂutter detection via Doppler-shifted echoes of high-duty-cycle narrowband signals. The large pinnae of bats that use prey-generated sounds to ﬁnd their targets supply high sound pressure gain at lower frequencies. Increasing domination of a narrow spectral band in echolocation is reﬂected in the passive acoustic properties of the external ears (sharper directionality). The importance of IIDs for lateralization and horizontal localization is discussed by comparing the behavioural directional performance of bats with their bioacoustical features."}}

Behaviors that affect contact rates among hosts could be important for viral diversiﬁcation because more frequent intra- and inter-speciﬁc contacts among hosts should increase the potential for viral diversiﬁcation within host populations. We used published data on bats to test the contact-rate hypothesis. We predicted that species forming large conspeciﬁc groups, that share their range with more heterospeciﬁcs (i.e., sympatry), and with mating systems characterized by high contact rates (polygynandry: multi-male/multi-female), would host higher viral richness than species with small group sizes, lower sympatry, or low contact-rate mating systems (polygyny: single male/multifemale). Consistent with our hypothesis and previous research, viral richness was positively correlated with conspeciﬁc group size although the relationship plateaued at group sizes of approximately several hundred thousand bats. This pattern supports epidemiological theory that, up to a point, larger groups have higher contact rates, greater likelihood of acquiring and transmitting viruses, and ultimately greater potential for viral diversiﬁcation. However, contrary to our hypothesis, there was no effect of sympatry on viral richness and no difference in viral richness between mating systems. We also found no residual effect of host phylogeny on viral richness, suggesting that closely related species do not necessarily host similar numbers of viruses. Our results support the contact-rate hypothesis that intra-speciﬁc viral transmission can enhance viral diversiﬁcation within species and highlight the inﬂuence of host group size on the potential of viruses to propagate within host populations."}}

Although Amazonia encompasses the greatest diversity of reservoir species, the outsized viral population diversity (virome) has yet to be investigated. Here, through a metagenomic approach, we identified 10,991 viral sequences in the saliva and feces of two bat species, Desmodus rotundus (hematophagous), trapped in two different caves surrounded by primary lowland forest, and Molossus molossus (insectivorous), trapped in forest and urban habitats. These sequences are related to 51 viral families known to infect a wide range of hosts (i.e., bacteria, plants, insects and vertebrates). Most viruses detected reflected the diet of bat species, with a high proportion of plant and insect-related viral families for M. molossus and a high proportion of vertebrate-related viral families for D. rotundus, highlighting its influence in shaping the viral diversity of bats. Lastly, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships for five vertebrate-related viral families (Nairoviridae, Circoviridae, Retroviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae). The results showed highly supported clustering with other viral sequences of the same viral family hosted by other bat species, highlighting the potential association of viral diversity with the host's diet. These findings provide significant insight into viral bat diversity in French Guiana belonging to the Amazonian biome and emphasize that habitats and the host's dietary ecology may drive the viral diversity in the bat communities investigated."}}

In the present study, we investigated vocalization development at a maternity roost of M. emarginatus in Kerend Cave in western Iran by sequential measurement of acoustic parameters in known-age neonates using mark-recapture sampling. Newborn pups of M. emarginatus produced both short and isolation calls. Duration of short calls of 1-day-old pups was on average 7.56 ± 0.05 ms and decreased during postnatal development to reach an adult-like duration of 2.78 ± 0.13 ms in the third week. Myotis emarginatus emitted various types of isolation calls, including classic, UP-tailFM and CF-tail during postnatal growth. As bat pups grew, both short and isolation calls changed in their spectro-temporal structure. Discriminant function analyses showed that each bat pup has a vocal signature that facilitates mother-infant communication. The current study reveals that M. emarginatus pups are highly vocal at birth, but gradually elaborate their sounds with an increase in peak, start and end frequencies as well as with a decrease in call duration throughout the postnatal growth period."}}

We collected data on echolocation, wing morphology, diet, and habitat use of sympatric Rhinolophus mehelyi and R. euryale. We compared our results with literature data collected in allopatry with similar protocols and at the same time of the year (breeding season).\nResults: Echolocation frequencies recorded in sympatry for R. mehelyi (mean = 106.8 kHz) and R. euryale (105.1 kHz) were similar to those reported in allopatry (R. mehelyi 105–111 kHz; R. euryale 101–109 kHz). Wing parameters were larger in R. mehelyi than R. euryale for both sympatric and allopatric conditions. Moths constitute the bulk of the diet of both species in sympatry and allopatry, with minor variation in the amounts of other prey. There were no inter-specific differences in the use of foraging habitats in allopatry in terms of structural complexity, however we found inter-specific differences between sympatric populations: R. mehelyi foraged in less complex habitats. The subtle inter-specific differences in echolocation frequency seems to be unlikely to facilitate dietary niche partitioning; overall divergences observed in diet may be explained as a consequence of differential prey availability among foraging habitats. Inter-specific differences in the use of foraging habitats in sympatry seems to be the main dimension for niche partitioning between R. mehelyi and R. euryale, probably due to letter differences in wing morphology.\nConclusions: Coexistence between sympatric sibling horseshoe bats is likely allowed by a displacement in spatial niche dimension, presumably due to the wing morphology of each species, and shifts the niche domains that minimise competition. Effective measures for conservation of sibling/similar horseshoe bats should guarantee structural diversity of foraging habitats."}}

As such they are likely to play key ecological roles as regulators of invertebrate populations and pollinators of forests. Although somewhat contradictory, current evidence suggest that logging impacts on the species richness and activity of insectivorous bats when forest structural complexity and the number of available roosting hollows are reduced. Inconsistent results concerning impact on species richness stem from methodological problems with bat surveys. \"Rare\" species are often recorded in low numbers, preventing habitat preferences and disturbance impacts from being determined. Radio-telemetry has demonstrated that roosts in hollows of mature trees are a critical resource for many species of bats due to species specific requirements. However, it is not yet possible to state whether bat populations are directly limited by the availability of hollows in areas where a mosaic of logged and unlogged forest exists. Although data on foraging areas are extremely limited, some species appear to be flexible, capable of flying across open areas and exploiting those rich in invertebrates. Some species (e.g., Vespadelus) show a high degree of site attachment, possibly indicating a susceptibility to logging, however, the extent of site fidelity for most species is unknown. As pollinators, megachiropteran bats are likely to play a key role in maintaining the genetic diversity currently present in eucalypts by facilitating long-distance movement of pollen. Areas that are productive in nectar and pollen have a high conservation value for these bats and many other nectarivores, however, the age at which important nectar-producing trees flower is generally not known. The extent to which wildlife prescriptions, such as habitat trees and mosaics of small reserves, mitigate these impacts on bat species requires urgent research."}}

It is also listed as a priority site for survey work. The current study undertook mist-netting, roost and observation surveys of the bat fauna of Danjugan Island, oﬀ the west coast of Negros Occidental, to inventory the bat species present and to provide baseline ecological information to identify key areas of conservation concern. Eight species – ﬁve megachiropterans and three microchiropterans – were recorded over the course of the study, representing over 10% of the total Philippine bat fauna. Four of the species are new records for the island, and three are IUCN Red Listed. The results show that the island provides important caveand tree-roosting areas for the local populations of several endemic and globally endangered species and sub-species. Already designated with reserve status, and with an environmental education programme established within the local communities, the island may be considered of national and global importance for bat conservation. Recommendations are given for future management."}}

We investigated the role of wild meat in food security in Madagascar, where consumption is poorly understood in urban areas and at regional scales. Using semi-structured interviews (n = 1339 heads-ofhouseholds, 21 towns), we aimed to: (1) quantify the amount and purpose of, (2) understand the drivers of, and (3) examine changes in wild meat consumption. Few respondents preferred wild meat (8 ± 3%) but most had eaten it at least once in their lifetime (78 ± 7%). Consumption occurred across ethnic groups, in urban and rural settings. More food insecure areas reported higher rates of wild meat consumption in the 6–8 months prior to interviews. Consumption was best explained by individual preferences and taboos. Less than 1% of respondents had increased consumption during their lifetimes. Wild meat prices showed no change from 2005–2013. Most consumption involved wild pigs and smaller-sized animals, though they were consumed less in the years following the 2009 coup. These data illustrate the differences between urban and rural communities, the occasions in which wild meat is used a source of food security, and provide evidence that some taxa are not hunted sustainably in Madagascar."}}

Due to its restricted distribution, habitat specificity, and diet re­ quirements, E. alba has been strongly affected by habitat loss and fragmentation during the last decade. In this study, we developed the first genomic resource for this species; we assembled and analyzed in detail the complete mitochondrial genome of E. alba. The mitogenome of E. alba is 16,664 bp in length and is comprised of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and a putative Control Region (CR) 1,232 bp in length. Gene arrangement in the mitochondrial chromosome of E. alba is identical to that reported before in other species of co-familiar bats. All PCGs are under purifying selection, with atp8 experiencing the least selective pressure. In all PCGs, codons ending with adenine are preferred over others ending in thymine and cytosine. Except tRNA-Serine 1, all tRNAs exhibit a cloverleaf secondary structure. The CR of E. alba exhibits three domains commonly described in other mammals, including bats; extended terminal associated sequences (ETAS), central, and conserved sequence block (CSB). A ML phylogenetic reconstruction of the family Phyllos­ tomidae based on all 13 mitochondrial PCGs confirms the monophyletic status of the subfamily Sternoderma­ tinae and indicates the close relationship between E. alba and the genus Artibeus. This is the first genomic resource developed for E. alba and represents the first step to improving our understanding of the genomic underpinnings involved in the evolution of specialization as well as acclimatization and adaptation to local and global change of specialist bats."}}

There are a few studies on this bat in Colombia, mostly on colony size, diet, ectoparasite records, and activity patterns in the Andean and Caribbean regions. Here, we provide information on the prevalence of chiggerfleas, Hectopsylla pulex (Haller, 1880), on M. molossus, along with molecular data on the flea, and its distribution in Colombia. In addition, we describe the size and sex ratio of the infested bat colony, located in the central Andes of Colombia. The bat colony was represented by ca. 45 individuals, of which 33 were captured. The colony had more females (25 individuals) than males (8 individuals). A total of four Pallas’s mastiff bats had chiggerfleas, H. pulex, most of which were attached to the bat’s faces and ears. The composition of the colony (sex ratio) and the observed activity times match those reported for other colonies of the species in Colombia. The cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, and the 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene obtained from H. pulex represent the second and first available sequences for the species, respectively.

During the dry season, E. helvum roosts in at least one large colony (ca. 500 000 individuals) in the southern forest zone of Ivory Coast. Following the birth of young in February, males and females move into the savanna zones, and the progressive establishment and decline of colonies along a south–north axis indicates that E. helvum migrates at least to the Niger River basin by the middle of the wet season (July). During the dry season, both M. torquata and N. veldkampi are absent from savanna sites, but are common in the forest zone. With the onset of the rainy season in March, catch rates of both species increase first at a southern Guinea savanna site and subsequently at a savanna site 400 km to the north, indicating that both species migrate at least to the southern Sudanese savanna zone during the wet season. Both sexes of N. veldkampi migrate, but the migration of M. torquata is restricted to the immature male cohorts. I argue that the high amplitude of the seasonal fluctuations in fruit abundance at savanna sites creates a wet-season surplus of food which results in low intra- and inter-specific competition levels at these sites relative to the forest zone. This may provide the conditions leading to the observed annual migrations."}}

For extensive surveys of potential pathogens in straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in Zambia, a total of 107 spleen samples of E. helvum in 2006 were inoculated onto Vero E6 cells. The cell culture inoculated with one of the samples (ZFB06-106) exhibited remarkable cytopathic changes. Based on the ultrastructural property in negative staining and cross-reactivity in immunofluorescence assays, the virus was suspected to be an adenovirus, and tentatively named E. helvum adenovirus 06-106 (EhAdV 06-106). Analysis of the full-length genome of 30,134 bp, determined by next-generation sequencing, showed the presence of 28 open reading frames. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that EhAdV 06-106 represented a novel bat adenovirus species in the genus Mastadenovirus. The virus shared similar characteristics of low G + C contents with recently isolated members of species Bat mastadenoviruses E, F and G, from which EhAdV 06-106 diverged by more than 15% based on the distance matrix analysis of DNA polymerase amino acid sequences. According to the taxonomic criteria, we propose the tentative new species name \"Bat mastadenovirus H\". Because EhAdV 06-106 exhibited a wide in vitro cell tropism, the virus might have a potential risk as an emerging virus through cross-species transmission."}}

Depending on species, these wingless flies exhibit either high specialism or generalism toward their hosts, which may in turn have important consequences in terms of their associated microbial community structure. Bats have been hypothesized to be reservoirs of numerous infectious agents, some of which have recently emerged in human populations. Thus, bat flies may be important in the epidemiology and transmission of some of these bat-borne infectious diseases, acting either directly as arthropod vectors or indirectly by shaping pathogen communities among bat populations. In addition, bat flies commonly have associations with heritable bacterial endosymbionts that inhabit insect cells and depend on maternal transmission through egg cytoplasm to ensure their transmission. Some of these heritable bacteria are likely obligate mutualists required to support bat fly development, but others are facultative symbionts with unknown effects. Here, we present bacterial community profiles that were obtained from seven bat fly species, representing five genera, parasitizing bats from the Malagasy region. The observed bacterial diversity includes Rickettsia, Wolbachia, and several Arsenophonus-like organisms, as well as other members of the Enterobacteriales and a widespread association of Bartonella bacteria from bat flies of all five genera. Using the well-described host specificity of these flies and data on community structure from selected bacterial taxa with either vertical or horizontal transmission, we show that host/vector specificity and transmission mode are important drivers of bacterial community structure."}}

Methods that make such assessments more standardized, efficient, and reliable are highly desirable. This paper proposes a new connectivity-based habitat model for bats (PREBAT), which could be used as a tool for impact assessments. Using data that was specifically collected for this purpose, the performance of PREBAT is critically analyzed and discussed. For this study, 50 sites within an area of 850 km2 in eastern Sweden were inventoried for four nights each using automatic ultrasound recorders to get an empiric measure of bat occurrence that could be compared with PREBAT predictions. The correlation between the predicted values from PREBAT and the observed bat activity (number of recordings) or species richness was tested using generalized linear mixed models. Predicted values of PREBAT are significantly correlated to the number of species that regularly (more than one night) occur at a given site, but not to the total number of species. PREBAT performed also much better at predicting the activity of forest-living species than overall bat activity, which makes PREBAT particularly suitable for predicting conflicts for those species. This study proposes a new habitat model for bats that takes spatial connectivity between habitat patches into account.

In this study we describe the kinematics of locomotion in both species, and the kinetics of locomotion in M. tuberculata. We sought to determine whether these bats move terrestrially the way other quadrupeds do, or whether they possess altogether different patterns of movement on the ground than are observed in quadrupeds that do not ﬂy. Using high-speed video analyses of bats moving on a treadmill, we observed that both species possess symmetrical lateral-sequence gaits similar to the kinematically deﬁned walks of a broad range of tetrapods. At high speeds, D. rotundus use an asymmetrical bounding gait that appears to converge on the bounding gaits of small terrestrial mammals, but with the roles of the forelimbs and hindlimbs reversed. This gait was not performed by M. tuberculata."}}

With many species specialized in frugivory, phyllostomids represent major partners of ﬂeshy-fruited plants in the mutualism of seed dispersal. Here we present dietary data from two subtropical rainforests of Argentina, where fruit diversity is low and thus offer unique opportunities to test hypotheses of diet selection originally proposed for species-rich tropical assemblages. Particularly, we tested whether frugivorous phyllostomids exhibit pronounced dietary specialization in core plant taxa where fruit offer is greatly reduced as compared to tropical rainforests. We analyzed dietary overlap and niche breadth of subtropical frugivorous bats on the basis of >1000 dietary records plus >500 samples from a previous study in the region. We show that in the subtropics, frugivores from different genera remain faithful to their respective core plant taxa with few exceptions, rather than shifting toward alternative fruit resources available in the study sites. This supports predictions of specialization, which is conﬁrmed to have a deep historical origin. The response of phyllostomid ensembles to restricted fruit diversity is at the level of species composition: absence of species for which preferred fruits do not occur in the sites. Taken together, these data lend strong support to hypotheses that explain coexistence of frugivorous phyllostomids on the basis of dietary specialization on core plant taxa with chiropterochorous fruits."}}

Sri Lanka is home to a large diversity of species, many of which are endemic but morphologically similar to species found in southern India, due to recent speciation events, suggesting a complex evolutionary history. However, in some taxa although morphological diversity has been noted, the genetic level variations are minimal. Among the wide-ranging horseshoe bats such a phenomenon is noted. In this study, we used bioacoustics, morphometric and molecular data to evaluate the relationships between the taxa of lesser woolly horseshoe bats in the India and Sri Lanka. Our study reveals that the two taxa—Rhinolophus beddomei Andersen, 1905 and here we have validated the existing subspecies from peninsular India and R. sobrinus Andersen, 1918 from Sri Lanka are genetically very close to R. perniger Hodgson, 1843. Currently the taxa—beddomei and sobrinus are recognized as subspecies of Rhinolophus beddomei Andersen, 1905. We provide a detailed description of the taxa beddomei and sobrinus as the original descriptions are limited in nature."}}

The species Vespertilio murinus, Pipistrellus nathusii, Nyctalus noctula, Myotis dasycneme, M. daubentonii, and probably Eptesicus serotinus are particularly widespread and abundant in Orenburg oblast (92.1% of all trapped bats). Two other species, Plecotus auritus and Myotis brandtii, are widespread, but with low abundance (3.6% of all captured individuals). Four species (Myotis davidii, Eptesicus nilssonii, Nyctalus leisleri, and Pipistrellus kuhlii) (3.7%) are rare and distributed locally, and Nyctalus lasiopterus, Myotis nattereri, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, and Myotis mystacinus (0.6%) are very rare. Compared to other Ural regions, Orenburg oblast supports a greater diversity of bats, which is primarily determined by the greater variety of natural and landscape conditions and a more southerly location. The bat fauna of Orenburg oblast, as well as the bat fauna of the Volga region, Cis-Urals, and Urals, are a transboundary Eurasian variant of the East European bat complex, which includes Central Asian species, in addition to European ones. The data of our research indicate that the territory of Orenburg oblast encompasses the range limits of nine bat species. The southern limits of the range are identified for Myotis nattereri, M. mystacinus, and Eptesicus nilssonii, the northern limits for Pipistrellus kuhlii, Eptesicus serotinus, and Myotis davidii, and the eastern limits for Nyctalus lasiopterus, N. leisleri, and Pipistrellus pygmaeus. All the species living at the range borders are rare in Orenburg oblast and recommended for being included in the regional Red Data Book."}}

Trichobius joblingi was the most frequent parasite of Carollia perspicillata; consequently, it was analyzed in greater detail. Sex and age were not critical factors for parasitism. A robust anthropogenic influence was observed; unexpectedly, a higher prevalence and abundance of bat flies were observed in preserved areas."}}

Research on white-nose syndrome in bats provides a case study to apply these considerations to determine whether research that harms ecosystems under crisis is justified. By expanding well-established guidelines for animal and human subjects research, we demonstrate that this research can be considered highly justified. Studies must minimize the amount of harm to the ecosystem while maximizing the knowledge gained. However, the likelihood of direct application of the results of the research for conservation should not necessarily take priority over other considerations, particularly when the entire context of the ecologic disaster is poorly understood. Since the emergence of white-nose syndrome, researchers have made great strides in understanding this panzootic disease and are now in a position to utilize this knowledge to mitigate this wildlife crisis."}}

We collected streblid bat ﬂies from the New World (México) and the Old World (Uganda), and used metagenomics to identify their viruses. In México, we found méjal virus (Rhabdoviridae; Vesiculovirus), Amate virus (Reoviridae: Orbivirus), and two unclassiﬁed viruses of invertebrates. Méjal virus is related to emerging zoonotic encephalitis viruses and to the agriculturally important vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV). Amate virus and its sister taxon from a bat are most closely related to mosquito- and tick-borne orbiviruses, suggesting a previously unrecognized orbivirus transmission cycle involving bats and bat ﬂies. In Uganda, we found mamucuso virus (Peribunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus) and two unclassiﬁed viruses (a rhabdovirus and an invertebrate virus). Mamucuso virus is related to encephalitic viruses of mammals and to viruses from nycteribiid bat ﬂies and louse ﬂies, suggesting a previously unrecognized orthobunyavirus transmission cycle involving hippoboscoid insects. Bat ﬂy virus transmission may be neither strictly vector-borne nor strictly vertical, with opportunistic feeding by bat ﬂies occasionally leading to zoonotic transmission. Many “bat-associated” viruses, which are ecologically and epidemiologically associated with bats but rarely or never found in bats themselves, may actually be viruses of bat ﬂies or other bat ectoparasites."}}

A prelimi� nary assessment on the presence of bats in buildings and their interactions with people was conducted in the eastern town of Moramanga. Fifty of the 156 buildings were reported to contain active bat colonies and 46 of these were in schools. The bats, two species of Molossidae, roosted principally in the roof spaces of buildings that were more than ten years old. Users of the build� ings were relatively tolerant of the bats, although 41 %  reported negative attitudes because of the odor of roosting colonies and some concerns over the possibility of contracting respiratory ailments from bat faeces. Guano accumulated in classrooms and was observed on floors and desks. Basic renovations could improve the learning environment for children and could be conducted in a bat - friendly way. More research is needed to assess the health risks to people from interacting with bats in Madagascar, and this includes people who study, eat, and handle bats or work and live in buildings or caves where bats roost."}}

We hypothesized that hypothalamic expression of leptin receptor mRNA would decrease during the premigration (PM) period in the little brown myotis, Myotis lucifugus. Body mass of M. lucifugus increased during the PM period, but serum leptin levels did not change during that time. Hypothalamic mRNA levels for both the short (ObRa) and fully active long (ObRb) forms of the leptin receptor increased during PM, but the relative increase in ObRa was larger and occurred sooner than ObRb. mRNA levels of an inhibitor of leptin signaling (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3: PIAS3) increased in hypothalami during the PM period in bats. Adiponectin is an adipokine that has been linked to obesity in rodents; normally, serum levels of adiponectin decrease in obesity. In M. lucifugus, adiponectin mRNA levels decreased in adipose tissue during the period of mass gain, but circulating adiponectin levels did not change. We conclude that the relative changes in leptin receptor isoform expression during the PM fattening period may favor binding of leptin to the less active short isoform. Coupled with increased expression of PIAS3 and the dissociation of serum leptin levels from body mass and adiposity, these changes could account in part for the adaptive fattening during the PM period. In addition, the adipokine profiles of M. lucifugus during the PM period and that of obesity in non-hibernating mammals are strikingly dissimilar."}}

The tentative group (Posa and Posa-like viruses: PPLVs) also includes ﬁsh stool-associated RNA virus (ﬁsavirus) as well as members detected in insects (Drosophila subobscura and Anopheles sinensis) and parasites (Ascaris suum). As part of an agnostic deep sequencing survey of animal and human viruses in Vietnam, we detected three husaviruses in human fecal samples, two of which share 97–98% amino acid identity to Dutch husavirus strains and one highly divergent husavirus with only 25% amino acid identity to known husaviruses. In addition, the current study found forty-seven complete posavirus genomes from pigs, ten novel rat stool-associated RNA virus genomes (tentatively named rasavirus), and sixteen novel bat stool-associated RNA virus genomes (tentatively named basavirus). The ﬁve expected Picornavirales protein domains (helicase, 3C-protease, RNAdependent RNA polymerase, and two Picornavirus capsid domain) were found to be encoded by all PPLV genomes. In addition, a nucleotide composition analysis revealed that the PPLVs shared compositional properties with arthropod viruses and predicted non-mammalian hosts for all PPLV lineages. The study adds seventy-six genomes to the twentynine PPLV genomes currently available and greatly extends our sequence knowledge of this group of viruses within the Picornavirales order."}}

The identification of astroviruses in a wide range of animals highlights the zoonotic importance of these viruses. Bats can harbor many different viruses, among which some are highly pathogenic for humans (for instance, Nipah, Ebola and SARS coronavirus), and also several astroviruses. As some RNA viruses can be directly transmitted from bats to humans, it is crucial to collect data about their frequency, genetic diversity and phylogenetic characterization. In this study, we report the molecular identification of 44 new astroviruses (with a detection rate of 4.5%) in 962 apparently healthy bats that belong to five different species and that were captured in different caves in North-East Gabon, Central Africa. Our results show that bat astroviruses form a group that is genetically distinct from astroviruses infecting other mammals. Moreover, these astroviruses showed an important genetic diversity and low host restriction in bat species."}}

Both cortisol and corticosterone were present in plasma, at a ratio of approximately 5:1, respectively. Glucocorticoid but not testosterone levels significantly increased prior to and concomitant with the evening active period. Restraint stress for 15-60 min resulted in a significant and rapid increase in plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoids. ACTH levels quickly returned to baseline following restraint whereas glucocorticoid levels remained elevated for at least 30 min after restraint ended. Plasma ACTH levels after stress were similar to levels reported after stress in other mammals. Stress-induced glucocorticoid levels were several-fold greater than those reported for most mammals. Restraint for 15 min significantly inhibited testosterone levels. Restraint stress did not affect hormone levels on the morning following restraint. Brief capture, handling, and release of the animals did not elicit increases in these hormones. The physiological responsiveness of the pituitary and adrenal glands, along with P. vampyrus's documented seasonality and range of social behaviors, makes these bats an excellent model for exploring the general physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes, as well as social influences on these axes. © Springer-Verlag 2006."}}

To document demographic impacts of WNS on Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat), we mistnetted at sites in western Virginia where Northern Long-eared Bats were captured in summer before (1990–2009) and after (2011–2013) the onset of WNS. Our mean capture rates per hour, adjusted for area of net and sampling duration, declined significantly from 0.102 bats/ m2/h before WNS to 0.005 bats/m2/h (-95.1%) by 2013. We noted a time lag in the rate of decline between published data based on bats captured during the swarming season and our summer mist-netting captures from the same geographic area. Although proportions of pregnant or lactating females did not vary statistically in samples obtained before and after the onset of WNS, the proportion of juvenile bats declined significantly (-76.7%), indicating that the viability of Northern Long-eared Bats in western Virginia is tenuous."}}

But while previous and ongoing research activities predominantly focused on viral agents, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in bats and their impact on bat mortality have largely neglected. Enteric pathogens found in bats are often considered to originate from the bats’ diet and foraging habitats, despite the fact that little is known about the actual ecological context or even transmission cycles involving bats, humans and other animals like pets and livestock. For some bacterial pathogens common in human and animal diseases (e.g. Pasteurella, Salmonella, Escherichia and Yersinia spp.), the pathogenic potential has been conﬁrmed for bats. Other bacterial pathogens (e.g. Bartonella, Borrelia and Leptospira spp.) provide evidence for novel species that seem to be speciﬁc for bat hosts but might also be of disease importance in humans and other animals. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of bacterial pathogens identiﬁed in bats and to consider factors that might inﬂuence the exposure and susceptibility of bats to bacterial infection but could also affect bacterial transmission rates between bats, humans and other animals."}}

The records of Pipistrellus from Altestovo 5 and Egorovka 1 and 2 (MN 12) are at present the earliest findings of this genus in Europe. The Nyctalus sp. from Palievo (MN 11) is one of the rarest records of this genus in the Neogene of Europe. The records of Vespertilio sp. from Palievo and Egorovka 1 morphologically are similar to Recent V. murinus. Recognition of Eptesicus aff. campanensis from Novoelizavetovka 3 (MN 12) is, at present, the youngest known record of this species. Eptesicus aff. kowalskii from Egorovka 1 and 2 differs from the nominotypical taxon in being smaller and in having a less reduced m3. The bat assemblages from Turolian localities of the Ukraine are most similar to those from Bernardière, Lobrieu and Dionay (MN 11) of France. The peculiar aggregation of bat taxa in the studied taphocenosis is consistent with avian pellet origin."}}

In these studies, 86 bat species (about 7% of the global extant tally) are reported as preyed upon or threatened by cats, and about one quarter of these species are listed as Near Threatened or threatened (IUCN categories Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable). In IUCN Red List assessments, cats are more frequently mentioned as a threat to threatened or Near Threatened bat species than to non‐threatened species (IUCN category Least Concern).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    In studies reporting on the incidence of bats in cat dietary samples (scats, stomachs and guts), the frequency of occurrence of bats in samples averaged 0.7 ± 2.1% (mean ± standard deviation;\n                    n\n                     = 102).

Cependant, l'ampleur de ce phénomène et l'impact de la prédation exercée sur les chauves‐souris par les chats n'ont guère été pris en compte jusqu'à présent. En particulier la question de savoir si des caractéristiques spécifiques rendent certaines espèces de chauves‐souris particulièrement vulnérables à la prédation par les chats reste en suspens.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Nous avons examiné l'impact des chats sur les chauves‐souris, en croisant les informations issues de la littérature scientifique sur le sujet et celles disponibles dans la base de données de la liste rouge de l'Union Internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature (UICN).

Ces études ont permis d’identifier 86 espèces de chauves‐souris (environ 7 % des espèces mondiales) représentant des proies ou étant directement menacées par les chats ; environ un quart de ces espèces sont classées comme \"quasi menacées\" ou \"menacées\" (catégories de l'UICN : En danger critique d'extinction, En danger ou Vulnérable). Dans les évaluations de la Liste rouge de l'UICN, les chats sont plus fréquemment mentionnés comme une menace pour les espèces de chauves‐souris menacées ou quasi menacées que pour les espèces non menacées (catégorie de l'UICN \"Préoccupation mineure\").\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Dans les études analysant le régime alimentaire des chats (excréments, estomacs et tubes digestifs) la fréquence d'occurrence des chauves‐souris dans les échantillons était en moyenne de 0.7 ± 2.1 % (moyenne ± écart‐type ;\n                    n\n                     = 102).

Similarly, estimating species vulnerability in the face of such dynamics is crucial for implementing effective conservation actions. We explored how bat diversity changes over the year across an altitudinal gradient and identified the environmental drivers that shape bat communities. By analysing species' marginality within the biophysical niche space, we evaluated bats' vulnerability to foreseeable environmental changes. Our results suggest that altitude, the proportion of forest cover and shrub cover are the main drivers shaping bat communities year-­round. Additionally, while some bat species are restricted to a single ecological assemblage (or ecological preferences group), others show greater plasticity throughout the year. Importantly, we found that although bats associated with highland habitats and forests could be particularly vulnerable to environmental changes (in particular Myotis mystacinus), this vulnerability correlates poorly with their national conservation status. We suggest that species' ecological plasticity is critical for the resilience of biological communities exposed to environmental changes and should be considered when planning tailored conservation strategies."}}

In parasite-associated microbial communities, it is hypothesized that evolution and ecology of an arthropod parasite will influence its microbiome more than broader environmental factors, but this hypothesis has not been extensively tested. To examine the influence of the broader environment on the parasite microbiome, we applied high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA to characterize the microbiome of 222 obligate ectoparasitic bat flies (Streblidae and Nycteribiidae) collected from 155 bats (representing six species) from ten habitat fragments in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Parasite species identity is the strongest driver of microbiome composition. To a lesser extent, reduction in habitat fragment area, but not isolation, is associated with an increase in connectance and betweenness centrality of bacterial association networks driven by changes in the diversity of the parasite community. Controlling for the parasite community, bacterial network topology covaries with habitat patch area and exhibits parasite-species specific responses to environmental change. Taken together, habitat loss may have cascading consequences for communities of interacting macro- and microorgansims."}}

This is true for Panay Island, located in the Western Visayas region of the archipelago, where the need for surveying remaining suitable bat habitat has been identified as a priority. Between 5 April and 9 May 2011 a survey of 21 caves was undertaken on Panay, along the central section of the west coast of the island and within the southern section of the Northwest Panay Peninsula. Survey methods included visual observations, emergence counts and the recording of echolocation calls. Of the caves surveyed, 19 were found to support bats or show signs of their use, and at least 12 different species were observed. Three large maternity colonies of the Common Rousette Rousettus amplexicaudatus and two of the Dusky Roundleaf Bat Hipposideros ater were noted as having particular significance in terms of their conservation value for local populations. Potential maternity colonies of Asian Lesser False Vampire Megaderma spasma, Black-bearded Tomb Bat Taphozous melanopogon and Diadem Roundleaf Bat Hipposideros diadema were also observed but not confirmed. M. spasma was the most frequently encountered species, occurring in small numbers at five different caves. Other species/genera encountered in small numbers were the Arcuate Horseshoe Bat Rhinolophus arcuatus, Common Short-nosed Fruit Bat Cynopterus brachyotis, Philippine Sheath-tailed Bat Emballonura alecto, Yellow-faced Horseshoe Bat Rhinolophus virgo, Bent-wing (Miniopterus) and Myotis bat species, and at least one other Horseshoe (Rhinolophus) bat species. Ten of the caves were confirmed to support multiple bat species. An indication of current threats and recommendations for further survey and management priorities are provided."}}

This review verifies the trends in pollution research, in particular, the use of genetic markers in the study of bats, based on a literature search of the Web of Science and Scopus platforms. Sixteen publications were identified during the search, which focused on the timeframe between 1996 and March 2022, including investigations of the effects of heavy metals, agri­ cultural pesticides, and radiation. The studies were based primarily on the application of biomarkers for geno­ toxic analysis, including the comet assay, micronucleus test, and the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Only 55 bat species have been investigated up to now, that is, 4% of the 1447 currently recognized. In general, bats exposed to polluted environments presented a higher frequency of genotoxic and mutagenic damage than those sampled in clean environments. Given the importance of the diverse ecological functions provided by bats, including pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal, it is increasingly necessary to investigate the damage caused to the health of these animals exposed to areas with high concentrations of contaminants. Although genetic biomarkers have been used to investigate physiological parameters in bats for more than two decades, then, many knowledge gaps remain, worldwide, in terms of the number of species and localities investigated."}}

Whereas birds and bats prey on herbivorous arthropods, they may also prey on arthropod mesopredators such as ants, with poorly understood consequences for pest biocontrol. We used a full-factorial experiment excluding birds, bats, and ants to assess their effects on (a) the abundance of multiple arthropod groups; (b) predation pressure on arthropods evaluated through artificial sentinel caterpillars; and (c) cacao yield over 1 year in shaded agroforestry systems of native cacao varieties in Peru. Birds and bats increased cacao yield by 118%, which translates in smallholder benefits of ca. US $959 ha−1 year−1. Birds and bats decreased predation by ants and other arthropods, but contributed to the control of phytophagous taxa such as aphids and mealybugs. By contrast, ant presence increased the abundance of these sap-sucking insects, with negative impacts for cacao yield. Notably, high abundances of the dominant ant Nylanderia sp., known to attend sap-sucking insects, were associated with lower cacao yield along a distance gradient from the closest forest edge. According to these results, arthropod predation by birds and bats, rather than mesopredation by arthropods, was most responsible for increases in cacao yield. Moving forward, detailed research about their trophic interactions will be necessary to identify the cause of such benefits. Retaining and restoring the large benefits of birds and bats as well as minimizing disservices by other taxa in cacao agroforests can benefit from management schemes that prioritize preservation of shade trees and adjacent forests within agroforestry landscapes."}}

My collection represents the first record of C. adjunctus in association with M eusttotiperius. The sex ratio in the C. adjunctus population collected was 1: 1 with 128 males, 128 females, and 755 nymphs. Predators of C. adjunctus in the cave environment included three spiders (Azilia eitinis Chamberlin, Eidmannella pal/ida (Emerton), and Gauce/musaugustinus Keyserling). The pathogenic fungus Aspergillus sp, killed C. adjunctus in the cave and laboratory. The mite Histiostoma sp. was phoretic on C. adjunctus. Cimex adjunctus also fed on human blood and elicited an immune response after initial exposure."}}
