This phenomenon is more spectacular for migratory species than sedentary ones, especially for representatives of the genera Pipistrellus and Hypsugo. Kuhl's pipistrelle Pipistrellus kuhlii (Kuhl, 1817) is the one of western Palaearctic bat species with conspicuous range expansion\u2014in the last three decades, the species has rapidly expanded and colonised new territories both northwards and westwards. In Central Europe, two genetic lineages occur that are also quite different morphologically: P. kuhlii kuhlii (hereafter P. kuhlii) and P. kuhlii lepidus (hereafter P. lepidus). The contact zone between these two lineages passes through Hungary and Slovakia, although the real range of distinct lineages and/or morphotypes are still unclear. The first records of P. kuhlii from Poland (probably belonging to P. lepidus) come from Warszawa, central Poland (2004) and Zawiercie, southern Poland (2005): both specimens were males, found in December in buildings. Since then, there have been further reports of the presence of this species in Poland\u2014occurring mostly in large cities along the valleys of large rivers such as the Wis\u0142a and Bug, from both periods of activity and hibernation. In subsequent years in Poland the occurrence of only P. lepidus has been confirmed, while P. kuhlii has been recorded from southern locations in the Carpathian Mountains in Slovakia. This paper describes the first record of this species from Poland, further indicating the existence of a maternity colony. In midJuly of 2020, a non-volant juvenile male was found in Krak\u00f3w, Krowodrza district (50\u00b004'11.7\" N, 19\u00b054'55.9\" E). Initially poorly visible diagnostic features have become unambiguous with development and similar to those in P. kuhlii: narrow pale wing margin and orange penis colouration. After about two months in captivity, a mature individual capable of flying was released at the site where it was found. The presence of a maternity colony indicates that this species (i) has been part of the Polish fauna for several years, and (ii) its range in Poland possibly expands much further north.",
