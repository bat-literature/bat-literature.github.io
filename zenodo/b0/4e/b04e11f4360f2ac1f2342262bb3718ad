Chalinolobus tuberculatus appeared to be common throughout New Zealand in the 1800s but by 1900\u201330 it was becoming scarce in many districts. Formal surveys in the South Island since 1990 either failed to find C. tuberculatus, or recorded bats in low numbers. Of eight sites where transect counts were undertaken, bats were recorded frequently at two sites (45\u201366% of counts; Eglinton and Dart Valleys), rarely at four sites (2.4\u201310.7% of counts), and were not recorded at the remaining two sites despite considerable survey effort. Of 10 sites where stationary counts using automatic detector units were used, no C. tuberculatus were recorded in three areas (153 nights combined), they were found rarely at six sites (2.1\u201321.0% of nights; 461 nights combined) and were recorded commonly only in the Eglinton Valley (85% of 120 nights). Assertions that C. tuberculatus are 'common' and that the conservation status is 'secure' are questionable and this review supports suggestions that the species should be classed as 'Vulnerable'. Possible causes of decline have been suggested including clearance and logging of lowland forests, predation by introduced mammals and owls, competition for roost sites by introduced mammals, birds and wasps, and human interference and disturbance at roosting sites. However, authors' claims have all been speculative and unsubstantiated. There has been no research undertaken to quantify these claims, and this is required urgently. The results of these preliminary surveys provide a new baseline against which future population trends might be compared. Increased effort using standardized monitoring techniques, applied at a national level, is required to confirm the possible trends and to help identify the best sites where conservation managers may attempt to restore the population level.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "O'Donnell, Colin F.
