Our knowledge on bat fauna is merely based on opportunistic and rare effort carried out by foreign scholars bounded with countries biological policy. Almost 40 years of biodiversity effort of Nepal, Small mammals has got no research and conservation priority either. Nepal is too far behind to its peripheral countries with no dedicated biologists for several years of countries conservation journey. Later this sector had been explored by university student to carry out their partial fulfillment of academic degree after early 2000 . The current authors are still struggling to knock the biodiversity stakeholders of the country to pull their attention to this untouched sector. Despite of less opportunity and insecure future of current Nepalese scenario, we are dedicating to this sector with the hope to make history of success to fulfill the countries gap in research and conservation of bats. We all authors are really thankful to our parents and families who keep their deep passion to let us walk on this sector with no direct merit in return.  Bat research and conservation activities only came in surface, when Nepalese youngsters were supported and inspired by regional (CCINSA) as well global chiroptera network primarily. Co-chair of IUCN Bat specialist group, Prof. Dr. Paul A. Racey, Regius professor (Emeritus), Aberdeen University, Scotland, provided the worthiest training on bats to Nepalese students. Sincere credit goes to keen naturalist, Sally Walker and her colleagues, Zoo Outreach Organization, for arranging this important program to Nepalese students in Kathmandu. Mrs Geeta Shrestha, NATURE, Baneshwor, Kathmandu is always appreciated for her very first effort to bat conservation, through the concept of bat club in Nepal. Dr. Paul Bates and Malcolm Pearch of Harrison Institute, UK, Dr. Gabor Csorba, Hungarian Natural History Museum, Hungary (HNHM). Dr. Sara Bumrungsri, Asst. professor, Prince of Songkhla University and Pipat Soisatak, Princess of Mahachakri Srindhorn natural History Museum, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand (PMSNHM), are unforgettable and supporting institutes and personalities to us. We are grateful to our university advisors of Tribhuvan University, Nepal specially Central Department of Zoology, Kritipur and Institute of Forestry, Pokhara who sympathetically guide us to our beginning academic project. We were really confused in those days how to begin, where to communicate since we had no international approach. We would like to remember Dr. Hem Sagar Baral who always fueled us frequently with inspiring guidelines and promoting will.  Bat research has succeeded to pull the governmental attention after getting priority in Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, WWF; Nepal to carryout the bat research in the protected areas of eastern Nepal. This project was the foremost opportunity obtained for bat research at national level. Dr. Sarala Khaling (CEPF-Regional co-ordinator) and Angphuri Sherpa (CEPF- Country co-ordinator) are worthily remembered forever to their inducing conservation scheme and sympathy to our efBats of Nepal A field guide/ forts which strategically put their attention to bat research though we were less experienced and trained. Meanwhile, Bat researches were simultaneously supported by international agencies: Bat Conservation International, Lubee Bat Conservancy, Rufford small grants and Chester Zoo.  A picture can speak thousand words, we have tried to include maximum photographs of the species (about 40 photographs); Most of the bat pictures used in this book were clicked during different field studies in Nepal. Some pictures are borrowed from Pipat Soisatak, PMSNHM, Dr. Gabor Csorba, HNHM.  We hope the book provide the chance to appreciate this unique component of Nepal's biodiversity heritage to governmental conservation agencies, wildlife policy makers, National and International conservation stakeholders, students, naturalist, National Parks and Wildlife divisions, Community forest users etc. People need to know, bat are important to be saved in order to secure life and nature and they are in real danger because they give births generally to a single young which is proportionately large (about 40% of mother's size) which is peculiar among mammals of nature. Many bats refuge proximity to human habitat, probably looking our sympathy for their life. This book provides the species profile of 53 bat species while 6 other are mentioned to probably occuring.  We are grateful to the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, World Wild Life Fund for supporting this publication as their second phase program. We have lots to walk ahead to meet the global achievement. We hope Nepal government, ministry of forest will ease the research policy wisely to change the previous situation and prioritize small mammals in research priority for holistic conservation effort. De facto recommendation is conservation without research is futile. We hope our current energy, and enthusiasm will get countries fulcrum to contribute for next advancement. This is our first effort and there might be several errors or incompleteness. Therefore we will highly appreciate reader's suggestive comments.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Acharya, Pushpa Raj", "affiliation": null}], "keywords": ["Bats",
