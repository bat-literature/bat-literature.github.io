Information on use of roosts by multiple species of bats in a given area may provide insight into interspecific ecological patterns and could improve management prescriptions to provide habitat for bats through time across diverse ownerships and over multiple spatial scales. We investigated use of conifer snags as roosts by females of 3 species of forest\u2010dwelling bats in Douglas\u2010fir (\n              Pseudotsuga menzesii\n              ) forests in the western Oregon Cascade Range. We radiotagged 29 female big brown bats (\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              ), 55 long\u2010legged myotis (\n              Myotis volans\n              ), and 27 long\u2010eared myotis (\n              Myotis evotis\n              ) and located 42, 105, and 24 snag roosts for the 3 species, respectively. All 3 species most frequently used Douglas\u2010fir snags and in similar proportions to their availability. Big brown bats and long\u2010legged myotis rarely roosted in stands &lt;40 years old but age of stands used by female long\u2010eared myotis did not differ from those randomly available. Odds of a snag being used as a roost by big brown bats increased with diameter at breast height and decreased with distance from the capture site. Diameter of snags used for roosting and the number of small (10\u201350 cm dbh) snags within the 20\u2010m radius plot were variables in the best model for roost use by long\u2010legged myotis. The best model for long\u2010eared myotis included distance to the capture site. Odds of a snag being used by female long\u2010eared myotis decreased with increasing distance from the capture site. There was considerable overlap in structural characteristics and the physical context of roost snags among the 3 species, but the types of roosts used among landscapes with differing densities of snags differed among the 3 species. Although big brown bats and long\u2010legged myotis used only snags and live trees as roosts, long\u2010eared myotis used a diversity of structures and the frequency of use of these structures differed with density of snags in the landscape. Relative to other roost types, frequency of use of snags by long\u2010eared myotis was nearly twice as high in landscapes with high densities of snags as in those with low densities. We found that some species of bats alter selection of roosts depending on landscape context and availability of different types of roosts. Our findings demonstrate that forest managers must consider the needs of multiple bat species and the distribution of roosts in the landscape, especially where densities of snags are low and at low elevations in intensively managed landscapes.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Arnett, Edward B.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Hayes, John P.", "affiliation": null}],
