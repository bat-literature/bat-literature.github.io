People are infected through contact with infected animals. The relative increase of human rabies acquired from bats calls for a better understanding of lyssavirus infections in their natural hosts. So far, there is no experimental model that mimics natural lyssavirus infection in the reservoir bat species. Lagos bat virus is a lyssavirus that is endemic in straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in Africa. Here we compared the susceptibility of these bats to three strains of Lagos bat virus (from Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana) by intracranial inoculation. To allow comparison between strains, we ensured the same titer of virus was inoculated in the same location of the brain of each bat. All bats (n = 3 per strain) were infected, and developed neurological signs, and fatal meningoencephalitis with lyssavirus antigen expression in neurons. There were three main differences among the groups. First, time to death was substantially shorter in the Senegal and Ghana groups (4 to 6 days) than in the Nigeria group (8 days). Second, each virus strain produced a distinct clinical syndrome. Third, the spread of virus to peripheral tissues, tested by hemi-nested reverse transcriptase PCR, was frequent (3 of 3 bats) and widespread (8 to 10 tissues positive of 11 tissues examined) in the Ghana group, was frequent and less widespread in the Senegal group (3/3 bats, 3 to 6 tissues positive), and was rare and restricted in the Nigeria group (1/3 bats, 2 tissues positive). Centrifugal spread of virus from brain to tissue of excretion in the oral cavity is required to enable lyssavirus transmission. Therefore, the Senegal and Ghana strains seem most suitable for further pathogenesis, and for transmission, studies in the straw-colored fruit bat., Rabies is a neurologic disease that causes severe suffering and is almost always fatal. The disease is caused by infection with a virus of the genus Lyssavirus, of which 16 species are known. These viruses replicate in neurons, are excreted in the mouth, and are transmitted by bites. Dogs are the most important source of rabies for humans, but recently there is a relative increase in people contracting the disease from bats. To better understand the development of human rabies caused by these bat-acquired viruses, we need to study this disease in its bat host under controlled circumstances. To do so, we chose a naturally occurring lyssavirus\u2013host combination: Lagos bat virus in straw-colored fruit bats. We compared three available strains of Lagos bat virus (all isolated from brains of this bat species) for their ability to mimic a natural infection. We used intracranial inoculation to ensure infection of the brain. All three strains infected brain neurons, resulting in fatal neurologic disease, however only two of the strains showed the ability to reach the site of excretion\u2014the mouth\u2014and were considered a suitable virus to use for further studies of this disease in bats.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Suu-Ire, Richard", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Begeman, Lineke", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Banyard, Ashley C.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Breed, Andrew C.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Drosten, Christian", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Eggerbauer, Elisa", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Freuling, Conrad M.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Gibson, Louise", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Goharriz, Hooman", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Horton, Daniel L.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Jennings, Daisy", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Kuzmin, Ivan V.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Marston, Denise", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Ntiamoa-Baidu, Yaa", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Riesle Sbarbaro, Silke", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Selden, David", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Wise, Emma L.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Kuiken, Thijs", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Fooks, Anthony R.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "M\u00fcller, Thomas", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Wood, James L.
