Based on the area of the cave's ceiling and wall covered with L. curasoae in relation to the potential roost area without them, in 1999 the abundance increased from 80% in October to 100% in November and December. In 2000 the population decreased to 80% in January, 50% in February, 30% in March, 20% in April, 10% in May, 5% in June and July, and less than 1% in August. The population rapidly increased to 60% in September and to 80% in October. Throughout the year there were significantly more males than females; however, there was significant heterogeneity over months. In September\u2013November there were more females, but in December\u2013August there were more males present. The majority of pregnant and lactating females were observed from December to March and in July, while males were reproductive from September\u2013January and in May\u2013June. Breeding activity was observed in the cave in November\u2013December. Twenty-six species of plants were consumed during the year, based on pollen identification from fecal samples. Bombacaceous species were the most important component of the diet from January to May and Cactaceae were most important in June\u2013September. Peak abundance and reproductive activity coincided with peak flower resource availability, which occurred between October and January and in June\u2013July. The year-round presence and reproductive activity of L. curasoae at this site throughout the year demonstrate that many individuals are annual residents in this area and indicate the importance of this roosting site. In order to develop a successful conservation program for L. curasoae, in addition to protecting migratory corridors and northern maternity roosts, it is equally important to identify and protect areas that function as breeding colonies and year-round sanctuaries for resident populations in the south.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Stoner, Kathryn E", "affiliation":
