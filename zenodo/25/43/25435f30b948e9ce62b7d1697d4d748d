Insectivorous bats can use such isolated resources owing to the high mobility of most species, but little is known of the relationship between bats and tree density, or of the impact of incremental loss of trees in the landscape. Bats were surveyed at 30 sites in south-eastern Australia, in five habitat categories representing a range of tree densities from remnant woodland blocks (&gt;35 trees/ha) to sparsely scattered trees (&lt;1 tree/ha), and open paddocks devoid of trees. Sampling was undertaken by using harp traps and ultrasonic bat detectors. The abundance of potential arthropod prey was assessed by using light traps. Eleven species of insectivorous bats were recorded and bats were widespread in all habitat categories; all species were recorded around scattered trees. Overall activity, as revealed by detectors, did not differ significantly between the four treed categories, but in open paddocks there was a lower level of activity and a different community composition. However, a regression model revealed a significant quadratic relationship between activity of bats and tree density, with highest activity at 20\u201330 trees/ha. All species were recorded in open paddocks, but for eight of the ten species this represented &lt;7% of their total activity recorded across all habitat categories. For six species, significant positive correlations were found between activity levels and the abundance of potential arthropod prey. In contrast to bat detectors, trapping results showed a significant difference in overall abundance of bats between wooded habitats, with decreased abundance as tree density declined. This study highlights the value of scattered trees as foraging habitat for bats, and emphasizes that, in rural land mosaics, such small and isolated habitat components have value for the conservation of biodiversity, and require greater recognition and protection.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Lumsden, Linda F.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Bennett, Andrew F.",
