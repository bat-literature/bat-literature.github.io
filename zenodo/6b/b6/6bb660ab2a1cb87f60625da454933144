We focused on bats (Microchiroptera) and investigated the use of the urban matrix and surrounding bushland in a region of Sydney, Australia, where remnant bushland persists and gardens often support large trees. Ultrasonic surveys were conducted at 40 sites over one summer season in the backyard matrix, bushland remnants and surrounding National Parks to determine which species were present, and the influence of landscape elements and habitat characteristics on activity, species richness and presence of individual species. In total, 15 of the 17 microbat species known from the Sydney region were recorded in the study area. Yet only three of these species, Chalinolobus gouldii, Mormopterus species 2 and Miniopterus schreibersii were present in more than 40% of sites. Bat activity was significantly higher in remnant bushland on shale soils and in backyards, compared with sandstone gully and ridge remnants, or reference sites in nearby National Parks. Furthermore, species assemblages in urban areas were different from assemblages in reference sites. Of all the habitat characteristics examined, the amount of bushland within 0.5\u20133 km surrounding a site and tree density were the most common predictors of individual species presence, particularly rare species. Area of bushland, hollow abundance and average tree diameter were positively correlated with species richness, while tree diameter was the strongest predictor of total microbat activity.The proximity of large areas of bushland and the many trees remaining in residential areas of the northern 'leafy' suburbs of Sydney allowed the persistence of a range of bat species. The higher bat activity on fertile shale soils indicated that bushland remnants embedded within cities can have high conservation value for bats. Surveys in more urbanized areas of Sydney are needed to test predictions of the models derived in this study.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Basham, Rochelle", "affiliation":
