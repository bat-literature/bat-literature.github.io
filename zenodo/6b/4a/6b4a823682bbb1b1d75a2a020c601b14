The aim of this study was to locate and georeference D.rotundus shelters in the Municipality of S\u00e3o Pedro - SP, Brazil, and verify their nature (artificial or natural), surrounding landscape and distance from main rivers. To do this, two samples were taken of populations in shelters, with an interval of six months between them, capturing all the bats existent in shelters with fewer than 20 individuals and approximately 20% of the bats present in shelters with over 20 individuals in order to quantify their gender and age distribution. The majority of D. rotundus (67%) were verified to be artificial and the remainder (33%) natural. Of the six artificial shelters found, five were located in abandoned houses and one in a rain water drainage channel. There were no signs of D. rotundus in other rural buildings and viaducts located in the proximities of pastures. In spite of the majority of D. rotundus shelters being artificial, the three most populated shelters were maternity colonies, two being located in grottos and only one in an artificial shelter (rain water drainage channel). The remaining shelters were occupied by only male individuals. With the exception of one shelter, all the other shelters were at a distance of less than 3 km from the main bodies of water in the study area, corroborating studies that have reported that the main rivers in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo are the main geographic features related to the presence of D. rotundus. It was also verified that 67% of the shelters were inhabited by only male individuals, which confirms other studies conducted in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, in which over 60% of the groups of Desmodus contain only male individuals.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Mialhe, Pj.", "affiliation": null}], "keywords": ["Biodiversity", "Mammalia", "Chiroptera", "Chordata", "Animalia", "bats", "bat"], "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "hash://md5/b6b4a5743a50aebed90012aa0969a69e", "relation": "hasVersion", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "hash://sha256/3d90ad90fef1694ac701fc65c9500a2319572ecd975c9a25d0e90620b293e884", "relation": "hasVersion", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "zotero://select/groups/5435545/items/HCFIHUQH", "relation": "isDerivedFrom", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "https://zotero.org/groups/5435545/items/HCFIHUQH", "relation": "isDerivedFrom", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "https://linker.bio/cut:hash://md5/3b92467ad33a9bc5cadd8a1cac423994!/b51929-54372", "relation": "isDerivedFrom", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "hash://md5/26f7ce5dd404e33c6570edd4ba250d20", "relation": "isPartOf", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.1410543", "relation": "isCompiledBy", "resource_type": "software", "scheme": "doi"}], "custom": {"dwc:class": ["Mammalia"], "dwc:kingdom": ["Animalia"], "dwc:order": ["Chiroptera"], "dwc:phylum": ["Chordata"]}, "resource_type": {"title": "Journal article", "type": "publication", "subtype": "article"}, "journal": {"issue": "3", "pages": "521-526", "title": "Brazilian Journal of Biology", "volume": "73"}, "alternate_identifiers": [{"identifier": "hash://md5/b6b4a5743a50aebed90012aa0969a69e"}, {"identifier": "urn:lsid:zotero.org:groups:5435545:items:HCFIHUQH"}, {"identifier": "10.1590/S1519-69842013000300009"}], "communities": [{"id": "batlit"}, {"id": "biosyslit"}], "relations": {"version": [{"index": 0, "is_last": true, "parent": {"pid_type": "recid", "pid_value": "13443945"}}]}}, "title": "Characterization of Desmodus rotundus (E.
