Young and old age-classes were sampled and these were stratified by size and shape. Where possible, revegetated categories were compared to remnant native vegetation with the same patch sizes, as well as very large remnants (&gt;1000 ha) and grazed paddocks. In total 120 sites were surveyed, with 10 replicates in each stratum. All bat species used revegetation sites, often with high activity (passes/night) levels. However, activity and species richness in revegetation was not greater than that recorded in the paddock matrix and activity in revegetation was less than a third of that recorded in remnants. Old, large plantings were an exception, recording twice the activity of paddocks, indicating that this was the only revegetation treatment that was used by bats more frequently than paddocks. The tree stand structure of old plantings was usually patchy, including the presence of gaps induced by drought and grazing associated mortality. Bats were generally insensitive to the effects of patch size and shape as well as the amount of remnant vegetation in the landscape. A negative relationship with understorey cover (including eucalypts if &lt;5 m high) was the most consistent predictor of total activity and species richness. The avoidance of clutter by many species of bats suggests that efforts to restore woodland communities should use lower stem densities. Improvements to revegetation programs to benefit bats are recommended and more broad-based studies that consider the varied requirements of a diverse fauna are encouraged.", "access_right":
