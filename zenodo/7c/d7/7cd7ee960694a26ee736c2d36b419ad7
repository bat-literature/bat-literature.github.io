Ecologists have documented both the importance of bats as natural predators of insects as well as their population declines after the emergence of a wildlife disease, resulting in a potential decline in biological pest control. In this work, I study how species interactions can extend beyond an ecosystem and affect agriculture and human health. I find that farmers compensated for bat decline by increasing their insecticide use by 31.1%. The compensatory increase in insecticide use by farmers adversely affected health\u2014human infant mortality increased by 7.9% in the counties that experienced bat die-offs.

Because bats typically prey on agricultural insect pests, this decline can be treated as a natural experiment to quantify the costs associated with the loss of an important ecosystem service. Frank used quasi-experimental methods to investigate how insecticide use can compensate for the loss of natural pest control from bats by considering both the economic and health costs of insecticides (see the Policy Forum by Larsen\n              et al\n              .). County-level insecticide use and infant mortality due to internal causes both increased after the emergence of white-nose syndrome, whereas farms' crop revenue decreased. This study provides an example of how biodiversity loss affects human well-being and presents observational methods for quantifying those costs. \u2014Bianca Lopez\n            \n          , \n            \n              INTRODUCTION\n              Scientists have long theorized that declines in biodiversity and continued degradation of ecosystem functioning would lead to meaningful negative impacts on human well-being. Quantifying those impacts is challenging because of the limited measurements available on wildlife and plant populations as well as the ethical and feasibility constraints involved with randomly manipulating ecosystems at scales that would allow for the testing of key theoretical predictions. This work makes a contribution to our understanding of the relationship between ecosystem functioning and human well-being by using a natural experiment\u2014an occurrence resulting from unexpected changes in environmental conditions that approximates a randomized control trial. Specifically, I use the sudden emergence of a deadly wildlife disease in insect-eating bats\u2014known as white-nose syndrome\u2014to quantify the benefits from their provision of biological pest control. I validate previous theoretical predictions that farmers respond by substituting bats with insecticides; however, because those are toxic compounds, by design, this substitution leads to higher human infant mortality rates in the areas affected by the bat die-offs.\n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              \n                Ecologists have established, through experimental and observational studies, that insect-eating bats can limit crop pest populations. A long-standing prediction has been that if bat populations were to decline, so would their provision of biological pest control, and farmers would have to compensate with insecticides. Epidemiologists and public health experts have been concerned about the health impacts of pesticides even before Rachel Carson's seminal work in\n                Silent Spring\n                . The wildlife disease that is killing bats, with mortality rates averaging at above 70%, began spreading in the United States in 2006 as a result of an invasive fungus species. The gradual expansion of the disease provides a setting that approximates random manipulation of bat population levels, which allowed me to estimate how farm operations and human health change differentially before and after a location experiences a negative shock to biological pest control.\n              \n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              I used annual data at the county level on insecticide use and estimated that after the onset of bat die-offs, farmers in the county increase their insecticide use by 31.1%, on average. This demonstrates the substitution between a declining natural input and a human-made input\u2014providing the first empirical validation of a fundamental theoretical prediction in environmental economics. I proceeded to document that infant mortality rates due to internal causes of death (i.e., not due to accidents or homicides) increased by 7.9%, on average, in the affected counties. This result highlights that real-world use levels of insecticides have a detrimental impact on health, even when used within regulatory limits, which highlights the difficulties of assessing the public health impacts of pesticides when regulating them individually.\n              The staggered expansion of the wildlife disease supports the causal interpretation of the results. Any additional alternative explanation would need to change along the expansion path of the wildlife disease around the same timing of its expansion. In additional analyses, I demonstrate that changes in crop composition, in other types of mortality, or in economic conditions fail to explain the observed results, even when controlling for fine-scaled and flexible time trends.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              These findings help validate previous theoretical predictions regarding well-functioning ecosystems, where interactions between natural enemies\u2014insect-eating bats and crop pests\u2014allow farmers to use lower amounts of toxic substitutes. Not only are these results informative about natural enemy interactions generally, and biological pest control more specifically, they also highlight the direct agricultural and health benefits that bats provide. White-nose syndrome is but one of many threats that bats face, including those that are shared with multiple other species, such as habitat loss and climate change.\n              Improving our understanding of how changes in biodiversity affect human well-being will be important when designing and implementing conservation policies. These findings inform ongoing efforts, such as pursuing the ambitious goal to place 30% of land and marine areas under protection by 2030, and highlight the importance of continued monitoring of biodiversity levels, as in the assessments released by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.\n              \n                \n                  Schematic framework linking the ecosystem and human health as being intermediated by the agricultural system.\n                  The figure depicts the main elements in the study and the theoretical predictions made regarding how (i) bat die-offs due to an invasive fungus species lead to lower provision of biological pest control, (ii) in turn causing farmers to compensate with higher insecticide use, and (iii) resulting in negative impacts on human infant health.
