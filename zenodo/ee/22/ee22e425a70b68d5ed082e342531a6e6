Western populations, which are the focus of this assessment, do not enjoy federal legislation protecting either them or their habitat. Various regional, state, and private organizations consider Townsend's big-eared bat to be vulnerable to extirpation due to: 1) apparent rarity and long-term decline in numbers; 2) narrow roosting requirements; 3) loss, modification, and disturbance of roosting habitat; and 4) general lack of information regarding the species. The likelihood of long-term persistence of Townsend's big-eared bat in Region 2 and elsewhere can be enhanced by actions that address the primary threats to the species (listed below). Though we summarize the threats below in order of priority, it should be recognized that the best results will come from concurrently addressing these threats when crafting and implementing management plans. v Loss, modification, and disturbance of roosting habitat resulting from: \u00b2 Uninformed closure of abandoned mines: This is probably the most egregious act regularly performed by management agencies with respect to cavernicolous species of bats in general and Townsend's big-eared bat specifically. At a minimum, closure of historic or abandoned mines eliminates potential roosting habitat for Townsend's big-eared bat. In the worst case scenario, bats using a mine when it is closed have little chance of escape, resulting in both loss of habitat and direct loss of bats. \u00b2 Recreation: Human activity at roosts, particularly recreational exploration of caves and mine interiors, may lead to abandonment of the roost or unnecessary expenditure of crucial energy reserves. Like other bats, Townsend's big-eared bat is particularly sensitive to variations in survival and reproductive output. Therefore, human activity in and near roosts must be curbed, especially during reproductive and hibernal periods. \u00b2 Renewed mining at historical sites: An increase in renewed mining can directly impact Townsend's big-eared bats using abandoned mines in two ways: \u00b3 by disturbing and displacing bats that may have been using a mine \u00b3 by eliminating potential roosting habitat. Furthermore, renewed mining can liberate heavy metals and other toxic materials, leading to contaminated water impoundments. In either case, with its close association to abandoned mines and reliance on open water for drinking, Townsend's big-eared bat may be more susceptible to ingestion of toxins following renewed mining at historical sites. v Loss, modification, and disturbance of foraging habitat resulting from: \u00b2 Elimination of forest canopy: Although Townsend's big-eared bat forages in a variety of habitat types, its flight and echolocation style makes it well suited to forage among the canopies and along the edges of mature forested stands. This species typically does not use large clear-cuts or regenerating stands in early seral stages. \u00b2 Elimination or alteration of wetland habitat: Forest wetlands represent abundant sources of insect prey and fresh water for drinking. Activities that reduce the productivity of wetlands likely impact local populations of Townsend's big-eared bat by reducing the quality of important foraging and drinking sites. Activities that alter the surface and subsurface hydrology of wetlands, including draining, stream diversion, and removal of shrub and overstory vegetation (e.g., through logging or grazing), ultimately reduce the value of wetlands to this species. As well, activities that increase sediment loads into wetlands (e.g., logging, grazing, road construction, mining) likely alter wetland soil and water chemistry and thus have potential to decrease the value of the wetland to Townsend's big-eared bats. \u00b2 Conversion of native shrub and grasslands to urban or agricultural uses: Encroachment of urban development and agriculture into areas of native vegetation likely alters the composition and abundance of insect prey in an area, and may affect the ability of Townsend's big-eared bat to find adequate prey. Encroachment may also disturb roosts by increasing the rate of human visitation, and increasing predation pressure from cats and other generalist predators associated with human settlement\n\n45 v Exposure to environmental toxins: Pesticides and heavy metals, if ingested by bats, can cause death or reduce reproductive ability. Pesticide application can indirectly affect bats via reduction of insect prey. Accumulation of pesticides and their residues in fat and brain tissue of bats may represent under-appreciated sources of mortality and loss of reproductive output. In addition, when bats drink from water impoundments produced by industrial or mining activities, they risk ingesting toxins and heavy metals, which may result in mortality of the bats. To insure the long-term persistence of Townsend's big-eared bat in Region 2, the following conservation elements should be employed to address the noted threats, as discussed in the body of this assessment: v Institution of long-term education program: As with other species of bats, Townsend's big-eared bat is often the victim of accidental or deliberate destruction, both to individual colonies and to their habitat. In part, this may result from commonly held misconceptions about bats and the lack of understanding by the public of the benefits that bats provide. Therefore, conveying the positive benefits of bats and dispelling baseless myths about them form the base for a strong management-oriented conservation program for this species v Protection of known roosting sites: Townsend's big-eared bats are extremely sensitive to disturbance at roosts sites, particularly during the reproductive season and during hibernation. Disturbances during these times likely contribute to reduced reproductive output. Populations are especially susceptible to variations in survival and reproductive output. Therefore, human activity in and near roosts must be minimized or eliminated, especially during reproductive and hibernal periods. v Assessment of patterns of roost use and movement: Townsend's big-eared bat is often assumed to exhibit a high degree of roost-site fidelity. Although certain types of colonies may show high fidelity to roosts (e.g., maternity colonies in caves), others may not (e.g., hibernation colonies in mines). A better understanding of patterns of roost use and fidelity is necessary to adequately protect roosting habitat through time and to adequately assess population trends. v Timber harvest regimes, prescribed burns, and other vegetation management actions should strive to maintain a mosaic of mature forest canopy that can be perpetuated through time. v Elimination of exposure to toxins: Chronic exposure to pesticides and mining-related contaminants have probable but hard to quantify effects on Townsend's big-eared bat and other species of bats. Efforts to remediate indirect sources of exposure to toxins and eliminate direct exposure will benefit this and other species of wildlife. v Monitoring of populations: To effectively assess the population status of and quantify the effectiveness of conservation practices on Townsend's big-eared bat, systematic monitoring of known colonies must be initiated and conducted at local and regional
