Proximity to bats is a risk factor for virus spillover to animals and humans. We conducted this study to assess knowledge, perceptions, and exposure to bats in communities living near bat roosts in Bundibugyo District, Uganda.\nMethods\u2002 A cross-sectional study using mixed methods with both quantitative and qualitative data was conducted between September and December 2022. Participants for the quantitative data (survey) (n\u2009=\u2009384) resided near bat caves and/or roost sites and were selected using multistage random sampling. The survey investigated participants' prior exposure to bats, as well as knowledge and perceptions of bat exposure. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with bat exposure. Participants for the qualitative data (focus group discussions) (n\u2009=\u200910, 6\u20138 participants each) were purposely selected based on engagement in guano mining, hunting, and farming activities. Perceived risk associated with bat-related activities were identified and ranked in the focus group discussions using participatory epidemiology tools.\nResults\u2002 In total, (214/384, 55.7%) had a history of bat exposure and (208/384, 54.2%) had poor knowledge of risk factors associated with bat exposure. Increased exposure to bats was associated with being male (OR\u2009=\u20091.6; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.4 p-value\u2009=\u20090.038), staying in urban areas (OR\u2009=\u20091.9; p-value\u2009=\u20090.010), hunting (OR\u2009=\u200910.9; p-value\u2009=\u20090.024), and positive perception to bat guano being safe as fertiliser (OR\u2009=\u20092.5; p-value\u2009=\u20090.045). During the proportional piling process, a total of 7 risk factors were identified by 10 groups with hunting during an outbreak and consumption of bats being the most frequently identified. Overall, there was a strong statistical agreement in the ranking across the 10 focus groups (W\u2009=\u20090.52; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01; n\u2009=\u200910). Based on the provided data, the adjusted odds ratio of 0.7 for the good measures (p-value\u2009=\u20090.112), suggests a potential protective effect on the risk of bat exposure.\nConclusion\u2002 Communities living around bat roosts frequently come into contact with bats, yet there is inadequate awareness regarding the behaviors that can lead to the transmission of bat- borne diseases to humans.
