Determination of morphological distinctness is thus important when relating morphology with ecology. This is the first of a series of papers investigating the ecomorphology of Microchiroptera in southeast Queensland, Australia, and in it I describe means and ranges of measurements and distinctness of wing morphology. In 21 species from this region, species means for aspect ratio (relative wing width) ranged from 4.98 to 8.25, while wing loading (mass by wing area) ranged from 4.32 to 15.9 N/m2. For these variables, each species' range (minimum\u2013maximum) overlaps that of at least one other species, with greater overlap at lower values. Morphological overlap was frequent, owing to a consistently wide range of wing dimensions within species, with greater overlap at low aspect ratios and wing loadings where species were more closely packed. For all variables, the variance arising from the method of measurement (wing extend and trace) was less than intraspecific variance, but in many cases was similar to interspecific overlap. A proportion of the range and overlap in wing-morphology variables is attributable to measurement variance. The variance in aspect ratio was lower than in wing loading at species, genus, family, and region levels. Phylogenetic constraint on aspect ratio appears to be greater than on wing loading, particularly at the family level. At family and genus levels, aspect ratio varied less than wing loading. No overlap in aspect ratio occurred at family level. I group species into morphologically distinct units and provide predictions of the flight behaviour of these.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Rhodes, Martin P", "affiliation":
