Sixteen P. alecto\nwere tracked during a 12-month period to 34 roosts and were recorded at 49\nforaging sites. Pteropus alecto moved roosts seasonally,\nfrom bamboo and mangrove habitats in the dry season to rainforest in the wet\nseason. All radio-collared male and female P. alecto\nroosted in rainforest during the major part of the wet season. Climatic\ninfluences may be responsible for this behaviour, with rainforest perhaps\nproviding stable temperatures and shelter from the monsoonal rains. There was\na significant seasonal difference in the distances moved by females between\nsuccessive roosts. There was an association between roosting and foraging\nhabitat: P. alecto roosting in bamboo and mangroves\nforaged predominantly in woodland, P. alecto roosting in\nrainforest foraged in Melaleucaspp. and rainforest\nhabitat. Females covered greater distances from roosts to foraging locations\nthan did males. Distances from roosts to foraging sites were reduced for males\nand females during the build- up season (September to November) and wet season\n(December to April). Seasonally, foraging habitat shifted both floristically\nand spatially with no significant difference between the sexes. The movements\nof one female P. alecto were recorded at hourly\nintervals over three consecutive nights at the beginning of the wet season.\nMovement patterns were very similar between nights and over these three nights\nshe foraged in at least 7 distinct locations. The total distance moved per\nnight was 15.5\u201319.9 km, including return distance to the roost, assuming\nstraight-line movements between hourly fixes. Most foraging was done less than\n6 km from the roost. The ratio of total distance moved in a night to the mean\ndistance of forage sites from roosts was similar between nights\n(3.1\u20134.3), suggesting that a single roost site to forage site distance\nrecorded during this study can provide an index of total foraging distance.\nLand tenure status identified for foraging and roosting positions recorded for\nP. alecto emphasises the lack of protection for habitats\nused by this species. Only 3% of foraging or roosting positions were\nrecorded in any type of conservation reserve.", "access_right": "open", "creators": [{"name": "Palmer, Carol", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Woinarski, J.
