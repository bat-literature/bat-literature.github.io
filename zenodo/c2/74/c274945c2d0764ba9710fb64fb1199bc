The loss of habitat structures has a detrimental effect on biodiversity and affects bat species that depend on vegetation structures for foraging and commuting.\n                \n                \n                  We investigated the impact of connectivity and configuration of structural landscape elements on flight activity, species richness and diversity of insectivorous bats and distinguished three bat guilds according to species\u2010specific bioacoustic characteristics. We tested whether bats with shorter\u2010range echolocation were more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than bats with longer\u2010range echolocation. We expected to find different connectivity thresholds for the three guilds and hypothesized that bats prefer linear over patchy landscape elements.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Bat activity was quantified using repeated acoustic monitoring in 225 locations at 15 study plots distributed across the Swiss Central Plateau, where connectivity and the shape of landscape elements were determined by spatial analysis (\n                    GIS\n                    ). Spectrograms of bat calls were assigned to species with the software\n                    batit\n                    by means of image recognition and statistical classification algorithms.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Bat activity was significantly higher around landscape elements compared to open control areas. Short\u2010 and long\u2010range echolocating bats were more active in well\u2010connected landscapes, but optimal connectivity levels differed between the guilds. Species richness increased significantly with connectivity, while species diversity did not (Shannon's diversity index). Total bat activity was unaffected by the shape of landscape elements.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . This study highlights the importance of connectivity in farmland landscapes for bats, with shorter\u2010range echolocating bats being particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. More structurally diverse landscape elements are likely to reduce population declines of bats and could improve conditions for other declining species, including birds. Activity was highest around optimal values of connectivity, which must be evaluated for the different guilds and spatially targeted for a region's habitat configuration. In a multi\u2010species approach, we recommend the reintroduction of structural elements to increase habitat heterogeneity should become part of agri\u2010environment schemes.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            This study highlights the importance of connectivity in farmland landscapes for bats, with shorter\u2010range echolocating bats being particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation.
