Currently nationally categorized as 'Data Deficient', L. mordax has several knowledge gaps, including basic ones on its natural history. Here, we provide information on L. mordax's pattern of nocturnal activity, reproductive peak, sex and age ratios, its relationship with ectoparasites, as well as its distribution and taxonomy. Fieldwork was conducted in the Caatinga (seasonally dry tropical forest) in north-eastern Brazil between 2012 and 2015, during which we captured 110 L. mordax individuals. Our results showed that there was no significant difference in body mass or forearm length between males and females, with a sex ratio of 1:1. We obtained four adult individuals for every subadult captured. Lonchophylla mordax individuals were active throughout the entire sample night period but with a significant peak in activity in the first 30 min after sunset. The number of captures was strongly negatively correlated with minutes after sunset. Pregnant females were captured between July and February, and subadults were captured mainly in July and August, suggesting that the peak of births occurred at the end of the dry period and the beginning of the rainy period in the study area. Additionally, almost 70% of L. mordax individuals were parasitized by streblid flies, with no significant difference in parasite load observed across seasons, sexes, and ages. However, the individuals' body condition index was negatively correlated with the parasite load. Natural history research, such as that described here, helps to fill knowledge gaps on L. mordax, including providing data for the decision-making in conservation plans. Moreover, we add information for a species-rich genus with closely related, but poorly-studied, species globally listed as threatened or near-threatened.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators":
