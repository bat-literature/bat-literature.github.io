Presumably, 17 mammal species from 11 families and five orders were distributed in its territory, and one species (steppe marmot) had already disappeared. Of them, seven species belonged to the steppe faunal core, three species were confined to floodplain meadows, six species were widespread and one species was domestic. Fifteen species occurred permanently and two species were recorded with a varying frequency. In the early 1950s, substantial changes took place in and around the nature reserve. A ditch was dug around the perimeter of the reserve and a forest belt was planted. Two much bigger and deeper ponds were created on the site of a small pond. A house and a brick stable were built on the steppe area, and apple trees and an alley of ornamental shrubs were planted. After the reserve was granted republican status in 1947, its environmental protection regime changed, and this had a notable impact on the vegetation. After grazing and mowing were banned, a thick layer of dead plant remains on the ground surface, reaching 5\u201310 cm in thickness, appeared in most of the reserve's territory. At that time, an absolute protected regime was established on an area of about 100 hectares. The rest of the area was periodically mowed. In the early 1980s, the ponds were heavily overgrown with aquatic and wetland vegetation, and the banks were overgrown with trees and bushes. Fish were introduced into the ponds. The woody vegetation in the forest belt also grew substantially and became dense. Since 1998, the nature protection regime in the reserve has changed: the \u00abperiodically mowed steppe\u00bb was mown annually for four years, and there was a break in the fifth year. All this affected the fauna and mammal population of the reserve. In 2009, the area of the reserve was increased to 880 hectares. As a result, three new ponds appeared on its territory. As of 2023, 31 mammal species from 16 families and five orders were recorded here. Of them, three species belong to steppe species, two to hydrophilic species, four to forest species, 17 species are widespread, three species were confined to floodplain meadows and two species was domestic. 21 species occur permanently in the reserve, 10 species visit the reserve regularly (one synanthropic species settles in during the warm period of the year).", "access_right": "restricted",
