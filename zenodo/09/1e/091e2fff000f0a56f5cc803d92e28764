The outbreak resulted in death of a horse  trainer and 13 horses and left a stable hand seriously ill. A further seven horses with evidence of exposure to  the virus were humanely destroyed to avoid possible further spread of the disease. Subsequent incidents from  the north of Queensland in Cairns to the New South Wales border at Murwillimbah have led to the deaths of a  further three people and 22 horses. Despite these periodic and ongoing incidents, Hendra remains one of the  world's rarest diseases.  Scientific evidence suggests that Hendra virus is carried by flying  foxes. Under unknown but rare circumstances, the virus spills over  from these bats to susceptible horses, killing over 70% of the horses  it infects. Under even rarer circumstances, the virus spreads to  humans who have had very close contact with Hendra infected  horses. While there is strong evidence to support this mode of  transmission (bat-to-horse-to-human) there is no evidence of bat-tohuman, human-to-human, or human-to-horse transmission of the  virus.  Since Hendra virus was first isolated, significant progress has been made in understanding the virus, where it  originates in nature, and how to detect infection and past exposure. Shortly after the September 1994 outbreak,  researchers isolated and characterised the virus, developed laboratory tests to detect infection in both humans  and animals, and identified the likely source of the virus. Processes have been put in place to reduce the  likelihood of outbreaks based on the knowledge obtained from these studies.  While there have been significant gains in knowledge about Hendra, much remains to be learnt. Ongoing  studies address the nature of the infection in bats including how and where infection occurs, how Hendra  persists in bat populations, and how the virus is transmitted to horses and subsequently to humans. As new  technologies are developed, better laboratory tests will be designed to detect and monitor past and current  infections. And future research will be directed towards developing better outbreak prevention and control, and  potential vaccines and treatments.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name":
