This has been achieved by transforming lowland forest habitats (floodplains) into simplified agroforests and intensive plantation in upland areas. As a\u00e7a\u00ed palm makes an important contribution to the economy and food security of local communities, identifying management approaches that support biodiversity and ecosystem processes that underpin fruit production on a\u00e7a\u00ed farms is essential.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We compared flower\u2010visitor communities and a\u00e7a\u00ed fruit production in floodplain forests and upland plantations, across gradients of local management intensity (i.e. a\u00e7a\u00ed density per ha) and surrounding forest cover. The relative contribution of biotic pollination and degree of pollen limitation were assessed using insect exclusion and hand\u2010pollination experiments.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We found that a\u00e7a\u00ed flower visitors are highly diverse (\n                    c\n                    . 200 distinct taxa) and had variable responses to disturbance. Bee visitation was higher in floodplains and positively related to surrounding forest cover, but other flower visitors, including specialised curculionid beetles, were unresponsive to changes in surrounding forest cover. However, intensive management practices (i.e. high a\u00e7a\u00ed palm densities) in floodplains and uplands had contrasting effects on flower\u2010visitor communities, with flower\u2010visitor richness being lower on intensively managed floodplain farms and ant densities being higher on intensive upland farms.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Pollination experiments revealed a\u00e7a\u00ed palm to be highly dependent on biotic pollination. Fruit set in open\u2010pollinated inflorescences was positively related to flower\u2010visitor richness and specialised curculionid beetle visitation, whereas the presence of ants on inflorescences had a negative effect.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Our study shows that pollinators are essential for a\u00e7a\u00ed fruit production, but that intensive farming practices have eroded the relationship between surrounding forest cover and ecosystem function in floodplains (i.e. conversion of native forest into simplified agroforests) and increased the frequency of antagonistic interactions in uplands (e.g. high ant densities). These findings underline the value of extensive management practices, such as the maintenance of other tree species within farms and adjacent unmanaged forest patches, to ensure the long\u2010term sustainability of a\u00e7a\u00ed fruit production in the Amazon river delta.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Our study shows that pollinators are essential for a\u00e7a\u00ed fruit production, but that intensive farming practices have eroded the relationship between surrounding forest cover and ecosystem function in floodplains (i.e. conversion of native forest into simplified agroforests) and increased the frequency of antagonistic interactions in uplands (e.g. high ant densities).
