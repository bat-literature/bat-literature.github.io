Bracken Cave is an unusual ecosystem because of the magnitude of allochthonous input of guano that is produced by the largest bat population in the world\u2014a colony of more than 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). Research on the guano-subsidy ecosystems dynamics of Bracken Cave is limited, but imperative to our understanding and conservation of this extraordinary ecosystem. The objectives of this study are to determine the quantity and quality of guano deposition across seasons and its effect on the macroinvertebrate community and to examine the effect of the cave's habitat characteristics, such as distance from entrances and depth within the guano substrate, on the macroinvertebrate abundance and taxon richness at Bracken Cave. Core samples of guano and macroinvertebrates were collected at increasing distances within the cave on a monthly basis. Guano from the core samples was analyzed with respect to C, N, and P to determine guano quality variations. In addition, pitfall trap sampling was employed to supplement the macroinvertebrate core sampling. An estimated dry weight total of 50,500 kg of guano was deposited on the 3078 m2 of floor from August 2009 to August 2010, with the highest rate recorded in September 2009 and the lowest in January\u2013March 2010. Variations in guano deposits with respect to seasonality do not have a significant effect on macroinvertebrate abundance and richness. On the other hand, habitat characteristics significantly affected the macroinvertebrate abundance and richness in the cave. Macroinvertebrate abundance decreased with increasing depth within the guano substrate. Carbon concentrations were significantly higher in the top layers of guano, while nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were not significantly different with respect to guano depth. Results from pitfall-trap sampling indicated that macroinvertebrate richness was significantly higher near cave entrances. This study indicates that the invertebrate community at Bracken Cave was relatively stable and experienced few seasonal fluctuations, but was shaped by the micro-habitat characteristics of distance from entrances and depth within the guano substrate. The bats and the nutrients that they contribute play a central role as productivity donors to the bottom-up dynamics of one of the most unusual cave ecosystems in the world.", "access_right":
