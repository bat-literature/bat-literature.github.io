Since first observed in the winter of 2007, WNS has led to unprecedented mortality in several species of bats and may threaten more than 15 additional hibernating bat species if it continues across the continent. Although the exact means by which fungal infection causes mortality are undetermined, available evidence suggests a strong role of winter environmental conditions in disease mortality.\n            \n            \n              2.\n              \u2002By 2010, the fungus\n              G.\u00a0destructans\n              was detected in new areas of North America far from the area it was first observed, as well as in eight European bat species in different countries, yet mortality was not observed in many of these new areas of North America or in any part of Europe. This could be because of the differences in the fungus, rates of disease progression and/or in life\u2010history or physiological traits of the affected bat species between different regions. Infection of bats by\n              G.\u00a0destructans\n              without associated mortality might also suggest that certain environmental conditions might have to co\u2010occur with fungal infection to cause mortality.\n            \n            \n              3.\n              \u2002We tested the environmental conditions hypothesis using Maxent to map and model landscape surface conditions associated with WNS mortality. This approach was unique in that we modelled possible requisite environmental conditions for disease mortality and not simply the presence of the causative agent.\n            \n            \n              4.\n              \u2002The top predictors of WNS mortality were land use/land cover types, mean air temperature of wettest quarter, elevation, frequency of precipitation and annual temperature range. Model results suggest that WNS mortality is most likely to occur in landscapes that are higher in elevation and topographically heterogeneous, drier and colder during winter, and more seasonally variable than surrounding landscapes.\n            \n            \n              5.\n              \u2002\n              Synthesis and applications\n              . This study mapped the most likely environmental surface conditions associated with bat mortality owing to WNS in the north\u2010eastern United Sates; maps can be used for selection of priority monitoring sites. Our results provide a starting point from which to investigate and predict the potential spread and population impacts of this catastrophic emerging disease.\n            \n          , \n            This study mapped the most likely environmental surface conditions associated with bat mortality owing to WNS in the north\u2010eastern United Sates; maps can be used for selection of priority monitoring sites.
