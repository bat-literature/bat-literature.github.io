The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites.\n            \n            \n              2\n              Hand pollination experiments showed\n              S. siamensis\n              to be partially self\u2010incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit.\n            \n            \n              3\n              Shorea siamensis\n              was pollinated by small\n              Trigona\n              bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites.\n            \n            \n              4\n              At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected.\n            \n            \n              5\n              Our results suggest that high reproductive success of\n              S. siamensis\n              is dependent upon cross\u2010pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed.", "access_right": "open", "creators": [{"name": "Ghazoul, Jaboury", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Liston, Katharine A.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Boyle, T.
