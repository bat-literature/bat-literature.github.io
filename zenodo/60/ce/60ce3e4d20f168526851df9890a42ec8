Information on mammals in this region from the first half of the 20th century to the present has been summarized. The change of species abundance and its possible causes are analysed. The general impoverishment of the mammal fauna has been revealed. Due to the transformation of natural complexes and the advancement of human activity in the floodplain, a number of mammal species have disappeared or decreased in number. Among the extinct species is the European mink. A number of other aboriginal species such as otters, ermines, water voles and others have become rare and need protection. At the same time, changing conditions in the floodplain contributed to the recovery of populations of some other species, such as the beaver. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, such synanthropic species as the brown rat, the house mouse, the serotine bat, Kuhl's pipistrelle, and the white-breasted hedgehog have firmly established here. The development of the floodplain by humans has led to the synanthropization of a number of mammal species. An example is the stone marten, which was not previously known in the floodplain. The degree of synanthropization of a number of floodplain-related bats (for example, mouse-eared bats) and insectivores (for example, moles) is also high. The appearance of new species in the floodplain was due to a radical change in conditions, in particular the cessation of spring floods, which led to hedgehogs, moles, and hares becoming permanent residents. The press of hunting in adjacent territories leads to regular migrations of ungulates to the territory of floodplain in Kyiv. The share of alien species is high; among them are the American mink and the raccoon dog. To protect the rare mammal species of the Dnipro's floodplain, a number of protected areas of local significance have been created in Kyiv, which hinders the development of the floodplain, as well as contributes to the preservation of natural complexes. It is important to create a number of new protected areas and include the most valuable sites into the protected zone of the projected Dnipro Islands National Nature Park. It is also necessary to take a number of mammal species under the protection of the local council, which is especially important in relation to the European mole, Eurasian water shrew, harvest mouse, forest marten, European badger, common weasel, roe deer, and European water vole.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Parnikoza, Ivan", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Zagorodniuk,
