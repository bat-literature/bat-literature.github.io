Its lowland forests, savannah mosaic, river systems, eastern chimpanzee, forest elephant, and lion are AWF conservation targets, as well as global conservation priorities. These targets are 'umbrella targets;' benefits from interventions, which are designed to conserve these targets, are intended to support the protection of the complete and nested suite of biodiversity in the landscape. The threats to the landscape are multiple, intertwined and escalating. The Bili-Uele Landscape has, until recently, been considered one of the most pristine and untouched ecosystems in central Africa, home to one of the Congo Basin's last concentration of large mammals, and the largest remaining continuous population of chimpanzees on the continent, referred to as a \"mega-culture.\" Researchers indicate, however, that this fauna is under imminent threat of rapid depletion or extirpation. Poaching (inclusive of trapping for live trade) is the most significant threat to the wildlife of Bili-Uele; rapid increases in poaching north of the Uele River can be correlated to an invasion of artisanal diamond and gold miners from 2007. Mining, agricultural expansion, logging, settlement and transport network expansion are cumulatively contributing to habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, while driving socio-economic and cultural change, which exacerbates the poaching threat. The drivers of these threats include poor to non-existent protected area management until recently, poverty, poor local governance, poor planning, lack of local, regional and national political commitment and coordination, few economic incentives for conservation, and limited protein alternatives. There is also persistent insecurity in the landscape due to the transboundary movements of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) LRA, as well as increasing transhumance in the north of the landscape by Mbororo pastoralists and associated conflicts. These drivers and related threats are expected to increase substantially in scope and severity over the next 5 years due to increased access, migration from CAR and increased access. Based upon the value of the landscape, the escalation of threats, and the significant opportunities to ensure effective biodiversity conservation, AWF committed to work with Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) to conserve the Bili-Uele Landscape for a sustained period of time. AWF designed a robust and multi-faceted program of work in consultation with stakeholders to assist in ensuring, along with key partners, the long-term ecological integrity of the landscape. The strategy includes three focal areas: 1. the Bili-Uele Protected Area Complex (BUPAC), comprising parts of the Bili-Uere, and Mbomu Domaines de Chasse, and Mbomu Faunal Reserve, constitutes the initial spatial focus for biodiversity conservation efforts; 2. surrounding rural land comprises the focus for engaging with communities around economic activities such as mining and agriculture; and 3. urban centers related to BUPAC via the bushmeat trade constitute a focus for education and awareness-building.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "African Wildlife Foundation",
