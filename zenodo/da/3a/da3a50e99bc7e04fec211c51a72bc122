Emerging risks from bat bushmeat in West Africa", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.13518118", "publication_date": "2014", "description": "(Uploaded by Plazi for the Bat Literature Project) Despite major advances in medicine, infectious diseases still kill 15 million people around the world annually \u2013 one quarter of global deaths. In the past four decades, 65% of emerging pathogens have been those that were transferred from animals to humans (zoonoses) and three quarters of these zoonoses originated from wildlife. A leading source of humanwildlife contact is through hunting wild animals for food. Western and central Africans alone may harvest five million tons of bushmeat annually. This industry raises concerns across disciplines: epidemiologists fear zoonotic diseases, conservationists fear the depletion of endangered species, and development practitioners worry for the welfare of people who depend on wild meat for protein and income. Of the many animals hunted for bushmeat, bats pose a number of questions. Hosting almost 60 viruses that could or do infect humans, bats also are suffering population declines from overhunting. Yet their roles as reservoirs of human disease or as sources of valuable products are largely unexplained. The presence of henipavirus antibodies and Bartonella bacteria in Eidolon helvum in Ghana, as well as the potential for commercial hunting of these fruit bats, inspired a study to: (1) delineate how bats and their pathogens may come into contact with humans; (2) understand how, where, and how many bats are hunted, prepared, and sold; (3) identify and characterise potentially atrisk populations for bat-borne zoonoses; and (4) determine whether transmission of selected bat-borne pathogens is already occurring. Through interviews with over 700 Ghanaians, the demographics and perceptions of people involved in bat bushmeat trade were identified. Hunting, selling, and consumption are widely distributed across region and tribal lines, with hot spots in certain locales; butchering is concentrated in females and active hunters. Interviewees held little belief of disease risk from bats, saw little ecological value of fruit bats and thought that only specific tribes would consume bats. Serological and culture evidence strongly suggests there is no current spill-over of Bartonella but that there may be human exposure to a henipa-like virus.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Paulsen, P.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Bauer, A.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Smulders, F.J.M.", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Kamins, Alexandra", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Baker, Kate", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Restif, Olivier", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Cunningham, Andrew", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Wood, James L.N.", "affiliation": null}], "keywords": ["Biodiversity", "Mammalia", "Chiroptera", "Chordata", "Animalia", "bats", "bat"], "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "hash://md5/c979a8f539865cc4dd66787e59780a44", "relation": "hasVersion", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "hash://sha256/8b1fb2dee9f6aa005c8c0947ff04dd14cf4fe55841c79915984ae764f9aba130", "relation": "hasVersion", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "zotero://select/groups/5435545/items/MHDMP78W", "relation": "isDerivedFrom", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "https://zotero.org/groups/5435545/items/MHDMP78W", "relation": "isDerivedFrom", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "https://linker.bio/cut:hash://md5/c831df83cbf5060392c3a222ffcbb363!/b231491-233954", "relation": "isDerivedFrom", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "hash://md5/26f7ce5dd404e33c6570edd4ba250d20", "relation": "isPartOf", "scheme": "url"}, {"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.1410543", "relation": "isCompiledBy", "resource_type": "software", "scheme": "doi"}], "custom": {"dwc:class": ["Mammalia"], "dwc:kingdom": ["Animalia"], "dwc:order": ["Chiroptera"], "dwc:phylum": ["Chordata"]}, "resource_type": {"title": "Book chapter", "type": "publication", "subtype": "section"}, "imprint": {}, "alternate_identifiers": [{"identifier": "hash://md5/c979a8f539865cc4dd66787e59780a44"}, {"identifier": "urn:lsid:zotero.org:groups:5435545:items:MHDMP78W"}], "communities": [{"id": "batlit"}, {"id": "biosyslit"}], "relations": {"version": [{"index": 0, "is_last": true, "parent": {"pid_type": "recid", "pid_value": "13518115"}}]}}, "title": "5.
