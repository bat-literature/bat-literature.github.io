Identifying\n                    Pteropus\n                    habitat preferences could assist in understanding the risk of zoonotic disease transmission broadly and, in Bangladesh, could help explain the spatial distribution of human Nipah virus cases.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We analysed characteristics of\n                    Pteropus giganteus\n                    roosts and constructed an ecological niche model to identify suitable habitat in Bangladesh.

Habitat suitability modelling may help identify previously undocumented Nipah outbreak locations and improve our understanding of Nipah virus ecology by highlighting regions where there is suitable bat habitat but no reported human Nipah virus.
