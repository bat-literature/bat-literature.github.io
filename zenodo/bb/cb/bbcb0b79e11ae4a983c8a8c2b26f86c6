Changes to global climate have increased the frequency and lengthened the window for wildfires. Anthropogenic fires are now commonly used to try to mitigate the risk and spread of wildfires or for ecological purposes, yet it is unclear how many flora and fauna species respond to this lower severity and more patchily distributed treatment. We assessed day-roost selection by a threatened narrow space bat, Nyctophilus corbeni, after a management burn left a mosaic of unburnt forest, low severity (ground scorch) burnt and higher severity (midstorey to crown scorch) burnt forest. Radio-tracking was used to identify day-roosts of 11 individuals (8 lactating females and 3 males) during the maternity season. Characteristics of day-roost trees (n = 42 trees) were similar for males and lactating females and were comparable to other day-roosts used elsewhere in the broader study area, with bats selecting moderately sized (23\u201324 cm dbhob) dead buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii) with hollows. However, roost selection at the scale of the neighborhood varied by sex and was random for lactating females. Selection of the post-burn mosaic by males was non-random at all scales of assessment greater than a 100 m neighborhood, with bats selecting areas burnt by low-severity fire at these scales, but avoiding areas of higher severity fire. Locally, there were ~14 more hollow trees per ha surrounding roosts in areas burnt by low severity fire than in the unburnt forest, whereas forest burnt by higher severity fire had on average ~8 fewer hollow trees per hectare. Our study confirmed that dead buloke with hollows is a key resource for N. corbeni that should be prioritized for retention, particularly when identifying areas to offset habitat loss. Patchy management fires appear to be compatible with roosting habits of breeding N. corbeni, provided hollow resources are not impacted by fire. Management burns may promote roosting habitat for male bats, but areas of higher severity burns need to be minimized. Further research is needed to assess the use of the post-burn mosaic for nightly movements, including foraging. The effects of repeated burning on hollow availability and roost selection by N. corbeni should be investigated to identify suitable intervals between fires for this threatened species.",
