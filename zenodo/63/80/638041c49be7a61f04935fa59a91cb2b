Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co\u2010evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti\u2010bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free\u2010living bat\u2013insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats\n                    \n                      N\n                      eoromicia capensis\n                    \n                    in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey\u2010selection factors to explain differences in observed diet.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Moth consumption by\n                    \n                      N\n                      .\u00a0capensis\n                    \n                    was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 5\u00b791\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00b725%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 35\u00b742\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00b790%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey\u2010selection models that included high\u2010efficacy estimates for eared\u2010moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared\u2010moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light\u2010induced, decreased eared\u2010moth defensive behaviour.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Policy implications\n                    . In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth\u2010eating bats and eared moths will face ever\u2010increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad\u2010spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth\u2010friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth\u2010eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth\u2010eating bats and eared moths will face ever\u2010increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively.
