The use of artificial light and aromatic scents in entomological research is one of the most effective methods for obtaining rich and diverse ecological and faunal information. In addition to scale insects, many other invertebrates, primarily insects, are attracted to light and bait. At the same time, large clusters of invertebrates that flock in masse and converge on light and bait, as readily available food attract a number of mammals with nocturnal activity, mostly insectivores (Soriciformes), bats (Vespertilioniformes), and rodents (Muriformes). A number of species that are rare and lead a hidden way of life are attracted to artificial light and aromatic scents, including species of the dormice family (Gliridae) such as the edible, forest, and hazel dormice. The latter are obviously attracted to the light by the insects. Instead, in case of the use of baits, for edible dormice and yellow-necked wood mice, probably the aroma and taste of the bait is what attracts them, because they were repeatedly seem feeding on the bait.  At the same time, bright sources of artificial light are obviously of interest to other mammals.  In particular, in this way were noted: hare, fox, European roe deer, and wild boar, as well as such rare mammals as lynx, wild cat, great jerboa, and thick-tailed three-toed jerboa. Based on such observations, as an example, a small overview of new findings of the forest dormouse is given, in particular in areas where this rodent species has not been recorded before or it was observed very infrequently. The authors noted this species on traps for scale insects in the highlands of the Ukrainian Carpathians (Chornohora ridge) and in the Northern Black Sea coast, within Odesa Oblast. Thus, standard methods of collecting field material often used in lepidopterological research, such as attracting by artificial light and aromatic scents, can be quite effective for detecting a number of mammal species of different taxonomic groups, including nocturnal mammals.", "access_right": "restricted", "creators": [{"name": "Geryak, Yurii", "affiliation": null}, {"name": "Khalaim, Evgen",
