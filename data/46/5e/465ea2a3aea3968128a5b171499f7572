Bats were captured biweekly using mist nets set during six hours each night. The ectoparasites were collected with tweezers and/or a brush wet in ethanol and stored in 70% ethanol. The specimens are deposited in the zoological reference collection of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul. Sixteen species of streblid bat flies were collected from 10 bat species of the family Phyllostomidae. Thirteen of the these streblid species were recorded for the first time in Pernambuco.",

It may have evolved as an adaptation to reduce the costs associated with mate-finding behaviours, such as predation risk. Duetting systems allow estimation of sex-specific predation risks of signalling and searching in the same species, giving insights into the selective forces acting on these behaviours. Using an acoustic–vibratory duetting katydid,\n              Onomarchus uninotatus\n              , and its bat predator,\n              Megaderma spasma\n              , we estimated the sex-specific predation costs of different mate-finding behaviours, such as walking, flying and signalling, by conducting experiments with untethered live katydids and bats. We found that acoustic–vibratory duetting benefits both the sexes as a low-risk mate-finding strategy.",

Behavioural studies on memory impairment associated with hibernation have been almost exclusively conducted on ground squirrels (Rodentia) and provide conflicting results, including clear evidence for memory loss. Here, we for the first time tested memory retention after hibernation for a vertebrate outside rodents—bats (Chiroptera). In the light of the high mobility, ecology and long life of bats, we hypothesized that maintenance of consolidated memory through hibernation is under strong natural selection. We trained bats to find food in one out of three maze arms. After training, the pre-hibernation performance of all individuals was at 100 per cent correct decisions. After this pre-test, one group of bats was kept, with two interruptions, at 7°C for two months, while the other group was kept under conditions that prevented them from going into hibernation. The hibernated bats performed at the same high level as before hibernation and as the non-hibernated controls. Our data suggest that bats benefit from an as yet unknown neuroprotective mechanism to prevent memory loss in the cold brain.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats inhabit a variety of climate types, ranging from tropical to temperate zones, and environmental differences may therefore affect the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of bats from different populations. In the present study, we provide novel data on the energetics of whiskered bats (Myotis mystacinus), which is the smallest species within Chiroptera measured to date. We investigated the thermoregulatory strategies of M. mystacinus close to the northern limits of this species’ distribution range and compared these data to other vespertilionid bats living in different climates. As mammals living in colder areas experience elevated thermoregulatory costs, often leading to an increase in BMR, we hypothesised that BMR of this northern population of whiskered bats would be higher than that of bats from climates with warm environmental temperatures. From a systematic literature search we obtained BMR estimates (N=47) from 24 species within Vespertilionidae. Our metabolic measurements of M. mystacinus in Norway (body mass of 4.4 g; BMR of 1.48 ml O2 g−1 h−1) were not different from other vespertilionid bats, based on the allometric equation obtained from the systematic literature search. Further, there was no effect of environmental temperature on BMR within Vespertilionidae. How these tiny bats adapt metabolically to high latitude living is thus still an open question. Bats do have a suite of physiological strategies used to cope with the varying climates which they inhabit, and one possible factor could be that instead of adjusting BMR they could express more torpor.",

For mammals, however, there are few data to show that navigation ability relies on sensing the natural magnetic field. In night-time migrating bats, experiments demonstrating a role for the solar azimuth at sunset in the calibration of the orientation system suggest that the magnetic field is a candidate for their compass. Here, we investigated how an altered magnetic field at sunset changes the nocturnal orientation of the bat\n              Pipistrellus pygmaeus\n              . We exposed bats to either the natural magnetic field, a horizontally shifted field (120°), or the same shifted field combined with a reversal of the natural value of inclination (70° to −70°). We later released the bats and found that the take-off orientation differed among all treatments. Bats that were exposed to the 120° shift were unimodally oriented northwards in contrast to controls which exhibited a bimodal north–south distribution. Surprisingly, the orientation of bats exposed to both a 120° shift and reverse inclination was indistinguishable from a uniform distribution. These results suggest that these migratory bats calibrate the magnetic field at sunset, and for the first time, they show that bats are sensitive to the angle of magnetic inclination.",

It has been suggested that this relates to the high metabolic demands of powered flight, a notion that is supported by the fact that pterosaurs also appear to have exhibited small genomes. Given the long-standing interest in this question, it is surprising that almost no data have been presented regarding genome size diversity among megabats (family Pteropodidae). The present study provides genome size estimates for 43 species of megabats in an effort to fill this gap and to test the hypothesis that all bats, and not just microbats, possess small genomes. Intriguingly, megabats appear to be even more constrained in terms of genome size than the members of other bat families.",

However, the costs of producing and maintaining a brain are high, and we argue that brain size should be secondarily reduced by natural selection whenever the costs outweigh the benefits. Our results confirm this by showing that brain size is subject to bidirectional selection. Relative to the ancestral state, brain size in bats has been reduced in fast flyers, while it has increased in manoeuvrable flyers adapted to flight in complex habitats. This study emphasizes that brain reduction and enlargement are equally important, and they should both be considered when investigating brain size evolution.",

New findings of M. emarginatus (and of the former) were made exclusively in the foothills of Central Dagestan and are mostly represented by large brood colonies. In two species of the genus Barbastella, the wintering places and distribution in Dagestan (which covers a vast territory from the southern borders of the republic to the latitude of Kizilyurt in the north) were established. In Rhinolophus mehelyi, a sharp decrease in the number in the famous Karabudakhkent Cave was noted. New findings of Tadarida teniotis confirm its wide distribution on the territory of the republic. This species was found for the first time at an altitude of 3763 m above sea level; thus, a new record for the altitude limit of its habitat was established. For the species M. emarginatus, B. barbastellus, and T. teniotis, the characteristics of echolocation signals are given.",

In terms of composition, the bat fauna of the Republic of Bashkortostan is a variant of the Central European fauna. It was revealed that the territory in question marks the eastern limits of distribution of Nyctalus leisleri and P. pipistrellus/pygmaeus. An important feature of the territory of Bashkortostan is the presence of places of mass wintering of bats of natural origin: more than 980 karst caves used by bats not only in winter, but also during the period of activity. According to the results of captures in 14 caves, data on the frequency and relative abundance of sedentary bat species in the Republic of Bashkortostan are given.",

The key territories in the gene flow between colonies are swarming sites. After wintering, most individuals fly to a distance not exceeding 15 km, which is confirmed by the positive values of genetic isolation distance (p ≤ 0.05). Females are characterized by natal philopatry, whereas males are characterized by natal dispersal. High genetic diversity and moderate genetic differentiation were found in wintering areas and summer habitat areas. Most intrapopulation groups are heterogeneous, but some show deviations from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.05), and inbreeding is possible.",

The relative abundance of the species decreased in the following order: Myotis brandtii (35%), Plecotus auritus (20%), M. daubentonii (13%), M. mystacinus (13%), Eptesicus nilssonii (8%), M. dasycneme (8%), and M. nattereri (2%). Singular E. serotinus were recorded not every year. The number of hibernating animals in pits was proportional to their size and the number of shelters. Bats used previously chosen shelters and were never found in adjacent caves. The maximum species diversity (H') and evenness (E) were observed in bat communities in medium-sized caves. One of the main factors of increasing abundance of hibernating bats in abandoned pits is their gradual colonization by the animals.",

It was demonstrated that formation of dense groups did not depend on the hibernating population size or density and was related to the biological characteristics of the species. Most Myotis brandtii and M. dasycneme (60–80% of the populations) wintered in groups. M. mystacinus, M. daubentonii, Plecotus auritus, M. nattereri, and Eptesicus nilssonii usually wintered singly (87% of the animals). In M. brandtii and M. dasycneme, as many as 78% of individual animals were in conspeciﬁc groups, whereas this proportion for the other species was no higher than 11%. All pairs of species exhibited negative assortativeness, which indicated a higher preference of spending winter in conspeciﬁc groups than in groups containing representatives of other species. Estimation of the ratios between groups containing animals of one and several species showed that conspeciﬁc groups were prevailing in M. brandtii and M. dasycneme, whereas all other species usually formed mixed groups.",

            "abstractNote": "Speciﬁc features of the spatial distribution and localization of bats have been studied during their hibernation in artiﬁcial caves of Samarskaya Luka. The proportion of cave area occupied by bats varies from 70 to 93% in large caves (>60000 m2), decreasing to 50% in medium-sized caves (10000–60000 m2) and to less than 30% in small caves (<10 000 m2). Approximately 9% of bats choose sites near cave openings, up to 25% prefer central parts, but most bats (about 66%) concentrate in the deepest parts of caves. Among wintering species, higher rates of occurrence and shelter occupancy are characteristic of Plecotus auritus, Myotis daubentonii, and M. mystacinus, whereas M. dasycneme and M. brandtii show the highest degree of aggregation. The optimal temperature range for the wintering of all bat species is 2–4°C. Myotis brandtii, Eptesicus nilssonii, and M. daubentonii prefer to hibernate in open spaces of cave ceilings; M. mystacinus, E. serotinus, and Pl. auritus usually occupy the middle and upper parts of walls; while M. dasycneme and M. nattereri occur mainly in hollows on ceilings.",

This test enabled the detection of various rabies strains belonging to rabies species 1, 5, 6 and 7 and demonstrated an overall speciﬁcity of 100% and a sensitivity of more than 88% when compared to FAT and RTCIT.

In the U.S., one organization that has contributed to changing people’s perceptions of bats is the National Park Service (NPS). The NPS offers a variety of educational programming on bats, including written educational material and ranger interpretive programs. These educational efforts about bats have increased with the discovery of white-nose syndrome (WNS), an invasive fungus that has killed millions of bats in North America. However, despite the NPS’s efforts to educate the public and conserve bats, managers lack information on visitor perceptions and knowledge of bats and WNS. This study examined U.S. National Park visitors’ attitudes towards bats, knowledge of bat ecology and human health risks, and knowledge of WNS to determine how these factors influenced their support of bat conservation efforts. In 2019, we collected 1365 surveys from visitors in eight NPS units with cave resources. Our results show visitors’ support for bat conservation in national parks was influenced by their positive attitudes towards bats, perceptions of ecosystem services, and recognition of WNS. However, park differences in WNS recognition suggested that there are gaps in public outreach and educational efforts. As threats to bats motivate management changes over the coming decade, understanding visitor perceptions of bats and integrating this information into cave management plans will be critical for the NPS to achieve its management goals of enhancing recreation and conservation in environments shared by humans and bats.",

The growing consensus about the aggregated pattern of this mortality at particular turbines suggests that the identiﬁcation of high-mortality turbines can decisively aid in the implementation of eﬀective management actions. Here, taking advantage of a long-term monitoring program of animal mortality at wind farms (10,017 fatalities of 170 bird and bat species between 1993 and 2016) in two Spanish regions, we demonstrate the utility of network analysis in identifying species indicative of high-risk turbines whose stoppage could signiﬁcantly reduce the mortality of other species. Our protocol can be easily applied to any region with available data on animal mortality to help managers reduce the negative impacts of wind farms.",

It is in winter hibernacula that bats are most vulnerable to the fungus that causes WNS, but the locations of over-wintering sites in western North America are largely unknown. This poses a significant challenge for bat monitoring, disease surveillance, and management efforts at the disease front. To advance initiatives to locate bats on the landscape, we developed real-time PCR assays to detect big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) from environmental DNA samples (eDNA). Three assays were designed, one each for eastern, western, and southern North America, to account for the high intra-specific genetic variability within big brown bats. We demonstrate that these assays can detect bat DNA in environmental samples, including air, water, and soil, and are able to detect target DNA at concentrations as low as 2 copies per reaction. Although the assays are highly sensitive, detections from samples collected in field samples were modest. Our findings suggest that eDNA may provide a much-needed, non-invasive alternative to conventional tools used to detect bats on the landscape but require further research to optimize their field application.",

Bats, the second-most diverse group of mammals, are critical to ecosystem functioning, but vulnerable to such anthropogenic stresses. There is little information on how savanna bats respond to land cover and land use, especially in Africa, limiting our ability to develop conservation strategies for bats and maintain the ecosystem functions and services they provide in this biome. Using acoustic monitoring, we measured guild-specific (aerial, edge, and clutter forager) responses of bat activity to both fine-scale vegetation structure and landscape-scale land-cover composition and configuration across the wet and dry seasons in a southern African savanna undergoing rapid land-cover and land-use change. Responses were guildand season-specific but generally stronger in the dry season. Aerial and clutter bats responded most strongly to landscape metrics in the dry season (positive responses to savanna fragmentation and water cover, respectively) but fine-scale metrics in the wet season (positive responses to water cover and grass cover, respectively). Edge bats responded most strongly (negatively) to the distance to water in the dry season and fine-scale shrub cover in the wet season. Our results show it is possible to maintain high levels of bat activity in savanna mosaics comprised of different land covers and land uses. Bats, and the ecosystem services they provide, can be conserved in these changing landscapes, but strategies to do so must consider foraging guild, spatial scale, and seasonal variation in bat activity.",

Thus, differences in the requirements of demographic groups are of importance in conservation. We combined behavioural and genetic data to investigate whether the sexually segregated parti-colored bat (Vespertilio murinus) exhibits sex-speciﬁc niche partitioning. We use our data to evaluate implications for conservation of this potentially vulnerable species in Switzerland, the western boundary of its range. Using radio-telemetry, we found sex-speciﬁc differences in habitat use. Foraging females strongly relied on lakes while foraging males displayed more ﬂexibility in their habitat use. Moreover, males covered signiﬁcantly larger foraging areas than females. Sequencing 341 base pairs of the mitochondrial D-loop of 247 individuals revealed sex-speciﬁc differences in the genetic structure of colonies, but no such difference was observed for three nuclear micro-satellite markers. We found high mtDNA diversity in two Swiss male colonies and one German female colony, but low mtDNA diversity in two Swiss female colonies. Our genetic data suggest that considerable gene ﬂow occurs via male dispersal and mating. At the same time immigration of females into the existing female colonies in Switzerland is rare compared to the immigration of new males into male colonies. Since we found the sexes in Vespertilio murinus to differ markedly in their ecology, population genetics, and behaviour, we conclude that sex-speciﬁc conservation plans are required to protect this species efﬁciently.",

Habitat modiﬁcation resulting from agriculture can, however, have both positive and negative consequences for animal species. The ecological trade-offs involved in agricultural development have often not been explored sufﬁciently well to identify mutually beneﬁcial solutions. Bats, for example, have been strongly impacted by agriculture intensiﬁcation, mainly through the destruction of forests and natural wetlands. However, artiﬁcial wetlands created primarily for irrigation in agricultural landscapes may provide foraging habitats for bats and thus contribute to both the conservation of bat species and the regulation of insect pest species. We studied the inﬂuence of artiﬁcial wetlands on bat communities in agricultural landscapes in South Africa. We used mixed models to assess spatial variations in species richness, total bat activity, and species activity across 30 landscapes. Each study site was centred on a ‘focal wetland’ and surrounded by various habitat categories: open habitat, vineyards, orchards and trees. Our results show a crucial role of wetlands for all bat species as well as a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of wetland size and water cover on bat activity. However, we observed no signiﬁcant difference in species richness and only small differences in activity levels between the ‘focal wetland’ and the surrounding habitats. The present study contributes to the body of literature suggesting that farm dams may act as biodiversity hotspots when properly managed. More generally, our analysis suggests that an in-depth understanding of the trade-offs between agricultural production and ecosystem integrity is important for ﬁnding mutually beneﬁcial outcomes.",

Twenty-ﬁve bats, mostly lactating females, were radio-tracked to 33 roost trees. Trees in unmanaged woodland were favoured as roost trees; woodland subject to limited logging was used in proportion to availability, and areas where open woodland and pasture occurred were avoided. Selection depended on tree condition (dead beech trees were preferred) and height (roost trees were taller than random ones). Cavity selection was based on cavity type, height and entrance direction: roost cavities were mainly beneath loose bark, at a greater height above ground and facing south more frequently than random cavities. Untouched areas of mature woodland should be preserved to provide roosting conditions for B. barbastellus. In logged areas, harvesting protocols should save dead and mature trees; frequent roost switching and small colony size imply that large numbers of roost trees are needed.",

            "abstractNote": "Agricultural intensiﬁcation in Northern Ireland has brought about large-scale changes to the landscape with a detrimental eﬀect on biodiversity. Between 1996 and 1998, we surveyed a stratiﬁed random sample of 1 km squares for bats using a spot-sample technique and time expansion bat detector to establish linear and area habitat associations. Bats strongly selected water bodies with bankside vegetation, treelines, and deciduous and mixed woodland edge, avoiding open areas such as upland/unimproved grassland and improved grassland. Of three sympatric pipistrelle species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus and P. nathusii), two were shown to forage in diﬀerent habitats; P. pipistrellus being more of a ‘generalist’, foraging in a wider variety of habitats than P. pygmaeus, a ‘specialist’ which foraged in a smaller range of habitats. Nyctalus leisleri selected parkland/amenity grassland, deciduous woodland edge and rivers/canals and avoided improved grassland, hedgerows, whilst Myotis spp. selected deciduous woodland centre, lake/reservoir margins and rivers/canals. Reduction in area and quality of inland water, deciduous woodlands and ﬁeld boundaries in Northern Ireland may impact on bat populations. Habitat management should focus on improving those habitats which are selected by bats, including the maintenance and enhancement of connecting linear habitats. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

            "abstractNote": "The highly ﬂexible and stretchable wing skin of bats, together with the skeletal structure and musculature, enables large changes in wing shape during ﬂight. Such compliance distinguishes bat wings from those of all other ﬂying animals. Although several studies have investigated the aerodynamics and kinematics of bats, few have examined the complex histology and mechanical response of the wing skin. This work presents the ﬁrst biaxial characterization of the local deformation, mechanical properties, and ﬁber kinematics of bat wing skin. Analysis of these data has provided insight into the relationships among the structural morphology, mechanical properties, and functionality of wing skin. Large spatial variations in tissue deformation and non-negligible ﬁber strains in the cross-ﬁber direction for both chordwise and spanwise ﬁbers indicate ﬁbers should be modeled as two-dimensional elements. The macroscopic constitutive behavior was anisotropic and nonlinear, with very low spanwise and chordwise stiffness (hundreds of kilopascals) in the toe region of the stress–strain curve. The structural arrangement of the ﬁbers and matrix facilitates a low energy mechanism for wing deployment and extension, and we fabricate examples of skins capturing this mechanism. We propose a comprehensive deformation map for the entire loading regime. The results of this work underscore the importance of biaxial ﬁeld approaches for soft heterogeneous tissue, and provide a foundation for development of bio-inspired skins to probe the effects of the wing skin properties on aerodynamic performance.",

Two comparisons were carried out, one between habitat occurrence within individual home ranges and within the study area, the other between time spent in each foraging habitat and habitat occurrence within the home range. The ﬁrst analysis showed that olive groves and conifer plantations were, respectively, the most and the least important habitats. The second analysis highlighted the importance of woodland for R. euryale, while urban sites, open areas and conifer plantations were avoided. We recommend that clearing of continuous, large areas of woodland for tree harvesting should be avoided. Conifers should not be used for reforestation. Urbanisation should be limited in the areas of greatest importance for the species, and linear landscape elements such as tree lines and hedgerows should be maintained. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

            "abstractNote": "Over the last decade, molecular dating methods have been among the most studied subjects in statistical phylogenetics. Although the evolutionary modelling of substitution rates and the handling of calibration information are the primary focus of species divergence time research, parameters that influence topological estimation, such as taxon sampling and tree shape, also have the potential to influence evolutionary age estimates. However, the impact of topological parameters on chronological estimates is rarely considered. In this study, we use mitochondrial genomes to evaluate the influence of tree shape and taxon sampling on the divergence times of selected nodes of the mammalian tree. Our results show that taxon sampling affects divergence time estimates; the credibility intervals for age estimates decrease as taxonomic sampling increases (i.e., estimates become more precise). The influence of taxonomic sampling was not observed on nodes that lay deep in the mammalian phylogeny, although the means of the posterior distributions tend to converge with increased taxon sampling, an effect that is independent of the location of the node. In the majority of cases, the effect of tree shape was negligible.",

This creates the need for habitat studies incorporating multiple scales and years. The objectives of this study were to determine habitat factors impacting bat activity and species richness along road transects at local and landscape scales and to identify areas of highest bat activity. Bat activity and richness was compared to local-scale field data and landscape-scale data measured in ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS. Hotspot analysis was conducted in ArcGIS to determine areas of highest bat activity. At the local scale, bat activity and/or species richness were positively associated with canopy height, clutter (percent obstruction by vegetation or other objects) at 0–3 m, humidity, natural habitat, canopy cover, months water present, and temperature, and were negatively associated with clutter at 3–6.5 m. At the landscape scale, activity and/or richness had positive associations with habitat heterogeneity, roads, open natural habitats, ponds, upland prairie, and overall forest cover, and had negative associations with conifers and cropland. High activity areas were consistent between years and clustered near protected areas. Low activity areas were typically located near agriculture. When managing bat habitat along roads, it would be advantageous to decrease mid-level clutter, vary habitat types, increase savanna cover, avoid excessive conifer or cropland cover, plant tall trees, and provide water sources. This study shows that combining acoustic road surveys with habitat analyses at multiple scales can be used to examine habitat factors influencing bat activity and species richness.",

We estimated species richness and calculated the total beta diversity based on Sørensen’s dissimilarity index (bsor). We estimated the species turnover using Simpson’s dissimilarity index (bsim). We then evaluated the nesting (bsne) by the difference between the dissimilarity indices (bsor and bsim). Based on this analysis, we identiﬁed the priority areas for the conservation of bats in the Cerrado based on the zonation approach. We found that the species richness and beta diversity of bats in the Cerrado are concentrated primarily in the central and northern portions of the biome. We also discovered that the conservation units of the Cerrado are ineffective for the protection of species with a restricted distribution (B 150 grid cells), such as Vampyrum spectrum, for which we propose the creation of new conservation units that better cover the diversity patterns observed in the present study. By conserving this diversity, we will also be protecting local habitats, which will in turn enable the survival of a wide range of species, and provide the ecosystems with the capacity to respond adequately to future changes in the environment.",

To investigate the evolution of GJB6 in mammals, we cloned the full-length coding region of GJB6 from 16 species of bats and 4 other mammal species and compared them with orthologous sequences in 11 other mammals. The results show purifying selection on GJB6 in mammals, as well as in the bat lineage, which indicates an important role for GJB6 in mammal hearing. We also found one unique amino acid substitution shared by 16 species of bats and 10 shared by two species of artiodactyls. This positioned the artiodactyls at an abnormal location in the gene tree. In addition, the cytoplasmic loop and carboxy terminus were more variable than other domains in all the mammals. These results demonstrate that GJB6 is basically conserved in mammals but has undergone relatively rapid evolution in particular lineages and domains.",

            "abstractNote": "Intensively managed forests are often seen as of low priority to preserve forest bats. The main conservation strategy recommended, i.e. saving unmanaged ‘‘habitat islands’’ from logging to preserve some suitable habitat, detracts conservationists’ attention from ameliorating conditions for bats in harvested sites. We studied the threatened bat Barbastella barbastellus, mostly roosting in snags, in two beech forests: an unmanaged forest—the main maternity site—and a nearby, periodically logged area. We compared roost availability, roost use, capture rates, food availability and movement between these areas. The managed forest had a greater canopy closure, fewer dead trees, a smaller tree diameter and trees bearing fewer cavities than the unmanaged one. These differences helped explain the larger number of bats recorded in the unmanaged forest, where the sex ratio was skewed towards females. Prey availability was similar in both areas. We radiotracked bats to 49 day roosts. Five individuals caught in the managed area roosted in the unmanaged one at 6.7–8.2 km from the capture site. Few bats roosted in the managed forest, but those doing so proved ﬂexible, using live trees and even rock crevices. Therefore, bats utilise areas in the matrix surrounding optimal roosting sites and sometimes roost there, highlighting the conservation potential of harvested forests. Besides leaving unmanaged patches, at least small numbers of dead trees should be retained in logged areas to favour population expansion and landscape connectivity. Our ﬁndings also question the validity of adopting presence records as indicators of forest quality on a site scale.",

This usually involves expert knowledge, expensive equipment and time-consuming post processing of previously recorded calls. Automated solutions exist, but are usually not as accurate as human experts. We present an automated solution for the processing of bat calls and identiﬁcation of bat species with extremely high classiﬁcation accuracy that can be used during life recording or in an automated post processing software. Our algorithm is the ﬁrst application of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to classify bat species based on sound spectrogram images of their echolocation calls.",

A review of criteria for species determination is presented, including a new criterion concerning the morphology of P4 roots, as well as the results of a statistical survey of skull dimensions and correlation and regression analyses. The author concludes that the above mentioned bats are not sibling species, but that they belong to different subgenera of the genus Myotis.",

This review explores how sensory cues arising from central auditory and somatosensory pathways actively guide the production of both simple sounds and complex phrases in mammals. While human speech is a uniquely sophisticated example of mammalian vocal behavior, other mammals can serve as examples of how sensory feedback guides complex vocal patterns. Echolocating bats in particular are unique in their absolute dependence on voice control for survival: these animals must constantly adjust the acoustic and temporal patterns of their orientation sounds to efﬁciently navigate and forage for insects at high speeds under the cover of darkness. Many species of bats also utter a broad repertoire of communication sounds. The functional neuroanatomy of the bat vocal motor pathway is basically identical to other mammals, but the acute signiﬁcance of sensory feedback in echolocation has made this a proﬁtable model system for studying general principles of sensorimotor integration with regard to vocalizing. Bats and humans are similar in that they both maintain precise control of many different voice parameters, both exhibit a similar suite of responses to altered auditory feedback, and for both the efﬁcacy of sensory feedback depends upon behavioral context. By comparing similarities and differences in the ways sensory feedback inﬂuences voice in humans and bats, we may shed light on the basic architecture of the mammalian vocal motor system and perhaps be able to better distinguish those features of human vocal control that evolved uniquely in support of speech and language.",

To test the extent to which fission-fusion dynamics are species-specific and shaped by environmental factors, we radiotracked two closely related species: noctule bats Nyctalus noctula and Leisler’s bats N. leisleri in well-preserved, old-growth stands of the Białowieża Forest, where roost availability and diversity is high and bats can potentially freely exhibit fission-fusion behaviour. We estimated the number of bats per roost and noted the tree species selected as roost sites. We evaluated the influence of ambient temperature and roost tree species on bat group size and the process of roost switching, and their seasonal component. Our results revealed that bat group size showed species-specific differences in seasonal variation, relationship to ambient temperature and tree species. The number of noctule bats emerging from a roost was relatively stable with a weak tendency to decrease during the breeding season while the number of Leisler’s bats emerging from a roost increased when the juveniles started to be volant. Group size of noctule bats increased with ambient temperature. Leisler’s bats formed smaller colonies in oaks and ashes than in other tree species. Roost switching rate was associated with ambient temperature and tree species selected by the bats. The bats changed roosts more frequently when the minimum ambient temperature increased, and less often in ashes than in oaks and other tree species. Our results show that bat group size and roost switching behaviour are shaped by both environmental factors and the stage of reproduction.",

Assuming that bats react to background targets in “edge space” but not in “open space”, we determined the border between these two habitat types for commuting individuals of the parti-colored bat Vespertilio murinus. We recorded sequences of bats’ echolocation signals while they flew parallel to the walls of large buildings and to the ground and determined the signals’ average bandwidth, duration, and pulse interval. These parameters varied systematically with the estimated horizontal and vertical distances between the bats and the background. A distinct effect of horizontal distance to the background on echolocation behavior was found for horizontal distances of less than 6 m, thus indicating the border between edge and open space. Only a few bats flew at vertical distances below 5 m. However, enough passages at vertical distances of 5 m and above indicated that the vertical border is somewhere below a distance of 5 m. Within edge space, V. murinus reacted to the background by reducing signal duration, increasing bandwidth at closer distances, and often emitting one signal per wing beat. In open space, signal parameters did not vary as a function of distance to the background. There, V. murinus emitted the longest signals with the narrowest bandwidth and often made one or two wing beats without emitting a pulse. With our data we support with statistical methods the hypothesis that echolocation behavior reveals the border between the habitat types “edge” and “open space”.",

            "abstractNote": "The 71 species of horseshoe bat (genus Rhinolophus) use echolocation calls with long constant-frequency (CF) components to detect and localize fluttering insects which they seize in aerial captures or glean from foliage. Here we describe ground-gleaning as an additional prey-capture strategy for horseshoe bats. This study presents the first record and experimental evidence for ground-gleaning in the little-studied Blasius’ horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus blasii). The gleaning bouts in a flight tent included landing, quadrupedal walking and take-off from the ground. The bats emitted echolocation calls continuously during all phases of prey capture. Both spontaneously and in a choice experiment, all six individuals attacked only fluttering insects and never motionless prey. These data suggest that R. blasii performs ground-gleaning largely by relying on the same prey-detection strategy and echolocation behaviour that it and other horseshoe bats use for aerial hawking.",

            "abstractNote": "Behavior and personality play a crucial role in the evolution and ecology of animal species. We have limited knowledge of bat personality traits, partially due to the time, equipment, and facilities needed to measure them. To help fill this gap, we developed a scale for quantifying aggressiveness in bats that can be used during ordinary fieldwork and handling by researchers. This scale is based on observations of the following ecologically relevant and easily observed behaviors in wild-captured bats during routine handling: amount and intensity of physical struggling, teethbaring, and biting. We then applied this scale to 35 wild-caught individual bats belonging to three different species or species groups (Chaerephon pumilus, n=29; Scotophilus dinganii, n=3; and pipistrelloid bats, n=3) and measured agreement between observers using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). We found that agreement between observers was good to excellent. This scale of aggressiveness provides an important, practical tool for researchers to reliably quantify this personality trait in wild bats that requires no additional equipment and minimal additional handling time. Collecting data on aggressive behavior during handling has the potential to increase our understanding of both intra- and interspecific variation in aggressiveness in bats, as well as the influence of this trait on many aspects of bat ecology. Finally, collecting data using this scale can facilitate comparisons between studies and promote research at broader spatial and temporal scales than commonly used in behavioral ecology studies.",

We describe the species’ search behavior and echolocation repertoire from the field and from experiments in a flight tent. In the field, bats varied signal parameters in relation to their distance from vegetation and usually flew close to vegetation. In the flight tent, M. nattereri detected and localized prey by echolocation alone as close as 5 cm from vegetation. Apparently, the bats were able to tolerate some overlap between prey and clutter echoes. Passive prey cues (vision, olfaction, prey-generated sounds) were not used in prey perception. The bats selected prey by size. The animals performed aerial catches and produced approach sequences typical for aerial hawking bats, but were able to do so within a few centimeters of the substrate. M. nattereri thus has access to silent, suspended prey very close to vegetation (e.g., spiders, and caterpillars on threads).",

Eight species of bats from three families were identified where Common Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and Pouch Tomb Bat (Saccolaimus saccolaimus) were recorded for the first time in Bangladesh. A total of 31bat individuals of 8 species were captured during 15 netting nights for morphological studies. Skull preparation was carried out for taking cranial measurements to identify the Pipistrelle species. No roosting colony of Pteropus gigantius was found in the study area but it visits the area only for foraging while the other species roost permanently. The old buildings in the study area provide suitable habitats for a significant number of insectivore bats. Indian Flying Fox (Pteropus gigantius) was the largest (mean head body length 23.33±1.86cm) and Least Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus tenuis) was the smallest (mean head body length 39.45±1.66 mm) species observed from the study area.",

Bat species and numbers inhabiting the mine were monitored during May, July, October and November 2002 and January, MarchiApril and October 2003. Bat numbers were recorded through the use of an infrared gate and data logger with a maximum number of 999 bats recorded in October 2002 prior t o the maternity season, and a minimum of 54 bats recorded in January2003, during the maternity season. Eastern Horseshoe Bats were identified using an Anabat detector during all monitoring sessions while the Eastern Bent-wing Bat Miniopterus schreibersii was absent during November and January.Sustained activity through the night at the mine entrance in AprilIMay coincides with the mating season, and this observation is consistent with bat swarming behaviour, not previously reported in Australia. Both bat species were recorded flying at the mine entrance throughout year, including winter. Winter activity indicates that surveys at mines, using an Anabat detector, can be productive during the cooler months of the year. Despite the fact that no evidence of breeding was noted during this study, high numbers through winter, peaking just prior t o the maternity season and possible mating behaviour in autumn, indicates that the mine should still be regarded as a high priority for management.",

Habitat selection by the golden-tipped bat Kerivoula papuensis was described using presence/absence data from 144 harp trapping sites between Cooktown in north-eastern Queensland and Bulahdelah in central-eastern New South Wales. Logistic regression was used to identify structural, topographic and other attributes of sites associated with the presence of K. papuensis. Occupied habitat was characterised by an abundance of vine drapes, the presence of the yellow-throated scrubwren Sericornis citreogularis, close spacing between stream channels, multiple tree layers, high relief and slope characteristics, westerly aspect, higher elevations, low abundance of large tree epiphytes and proximity to the nearest forest ecotone. However, aspects of habitat selection are poorly known, such as maternity roost selection and foraging habitat by the species. Further study is required to fully understand the habitat requirements of this species.",

This species spends a great proportion of time in roosting large social aggregations in urban areas, causing conflict between wildlife and humans. Little is known about why these bats choose to roost in some locations in preference to others. Roost selection by cavedwelling bats can be greatly influenced by microclimatic variables; however, far less is known about microclimate selection in tree-roosting species despite the direct management implications. This study aimed to determine the microclimate characteristics of P. poliocephalus camps. Temperature and humidity data were collected via data-loggers located both in six camps and the bushland immediately adjacent to the camps in the greater Sydney region. We found significant differences between the microclimate within the camps and the surrounding bushland. In general, areas within the camps had a greater variance in temperature and humidity than the alternative locations. We hypothesise that camps may be specifically located in areas with high microclimate variance to accommodate a range of individual preferences that vary depending on demography.",

This paper presents a geoinformation system (GIS) model of the potential B. walteri distribution range in the central Asian region produced with the MaxEnt software. The analysis is based on the geographical coordinates of 57 B. walteri registration points and bioclimatic data available in the WorldClim 2 database. The produced model is consistent with the known B. walteri registration points. The distribution range does not form a continuous area but consists of separate sections associated with localities distinguished by the most optimal climatic parameters. These sections are confined to the foothills and valleys used by the species to penetrate the mountains up to an altitude of 2500 m above sea level (Baltic Elevation System). In addition to the already known habitats of the species, the model predicts its distribution in western Iran and eastern Turkey. The produced model is based on 19 bioclimatic variables used in the WorldClim 2 database; six of them turned out to be the most important abiotic factors making the maximum (95%) contribution to the model: isothermality, temperature seasonality, minimum temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of driest quarter, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter. The interpretation of these parameters is consistent with the actual habitat conditions of the species. B. walteri is most likely to occur in areas where the climate is sufficiently hot, the amount of precipitation in the summer period is very small, and the temperature rarely drops below zero in the coldest months.",

Birds and bats may travel upwards of 50 km day-1 during feeding, and further during migration or feeding bouts over several days. Limited data suggest that they carry viable pollen. Several eucalypts have adaptations favouring bird pollinators, while some species, particularly Corymbia spp., have adaptations commonly found among plants pollinated by bats and other nocturnal visitors. Bats may have the capacity to carry viable pollen over greater distances than birds. We suggest that the effect of pollen transfer by birds and bats on the genetic structure of widespread eucalypt species is potentially greatest in fragmented forests where these animals can traverse gaps of several kilometres between discontinuous stands. Greater understanding of pollen movement by birds and bats in natural eucalypt forest is a prerequisite to understanding the potential for gene movement from commercial eucalypt plantations into native forests.",

            "abstractNote": "Although bats are frequently admitted to rescue centres — mainly as orphans — very little information is available on their survival after release. Our study answered the following questions: i) do hand-reared bats survive over a short time; ii) which activities and habitat selection do they exhibit; iii) are bats loyal to the release area; and iv) are they able to join local colonies? We radio-tracked 21 hand-reared Pipistrellus kuhlii over a two-year period released on a site that differed from that where they were rescued. At the study site they were provided with the same bat boxes used in the rehabilitation room. Nineteen bats were confirmed to survive, stay in the area and actively forage over 4–14 days. Fourteen day roosts in buildings (nine of which hosted a local colony) were used by 12 subjects. Bats travelled less than 5 km in total each night; their most frequent activity was night roosting, followed by foraging and commuting. We recorded typical foraging behaviour, including hunting around street lamps at sites exploited by many conspecifics. A comparison of habitats available within individual home ranges with those within the study area showed that urban areas, riparian vegetation and farmland were equally important and preferred to woodland. When the foraging time spent in each habitat was compared with habitat composition within individual home ranges or within the study area, urban sites were preferred for foraging over all other habitats, followed by farmland and woodland and finally riparian vegetation. Overall, we showed that hand-raised orphaned P. kuhlii may readily adapt to environments they are not familiar with, exhibit a high short-term survival and select key resources in the release area, provided appropriate rehabilitation and training techniques are adopted.",

However, lactose was found to be the dominant saccharide in this milk, as in most eutherian mammals. The biologic importance of oligosaccharides in Chiropteran milks warrants further study.",

            "abstractNote": "Infectious diseases caused by invasive, environmentally persistent fungal pathogens have increasingly endangered global biodiversity, yet disease management remains a major conservation challenge. A prominent example is white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by the invasive fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) that has devastated populations of multiple North American bat species, but for which few effective management tools exist. Here, we propose that strategies to delay environmental transmission of Pd during early winter could limit WNS disease effects across winter, beneﬁtting bats. We used a small captive experiment and a multi-year ﬁeld trial on wild, free-ranging bats to assess an environmental control strategy to manage Pd within its environmental reservoir in Pennsylvania, USA, where the pathogen has become endemic. The strategy centers on the application of Polyethylene Glycol 8000 (PEG) to roost substrates in summer, prior to bat hibernation, as a means to disrupt environmental transmission to bats in early winter. In the captive experiment, environmental transmission of Pd to immunologically na€ıve little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) occurred from roost substrates inoculated with Pd, but the application of PEG to these substrates effectively blocked this transmission. In the ﬁeld trial, Pd load and infection extent both declined substantially in free-ranging M. lucifugus after treatment relative to controls, with declines exceeding effects of inter-site and inter-annual variation. Pathogen prevalence and load also declined substantially after PEG treatment in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). No negative effects of PEG treatment were observed in body condition or colony counts of bats or in the microbial community. Together, these results are consistent with effective environmental control of Pd and reduced WNS disease effects in bats within contaminated hibernacula. The results also highlight the potential of carefully designed environmental control strategies for managing environmentally persistent pathogens.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats show pronounced and often-adverse reactions to artiﬁcial illumination at night (ALAN) when commuting, roosting or foraging. ALAN also affects bat drinking activity, at least when lighting occurs over short intervals. We tested whether continuous illumination of drinking sites over 4-h periods would lead bats to tolerate ALAN and resume drinking in the course of the night. We conducted our experiments in forest (Italy) and desert (Israel) sites to test whether in the latter habitat, where water is scarce, a greater motivation to drink might lead to less adverse bat reactions. We recorded 6853 drinking buzzes and 1647 feeding buzzes from 17 species and one species group. In the forest sites, species that hunt in open spaces or along forest edges showed little (P. pipistrellus and H. savii) or no (P. kuhlii and N. leisleri) drinking activity decrease, while those associated with forest interiors (Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus and bats in the genus Myotis) exhibited a strong negative response. In the desert sites, all studied species reduced drinking activity, yet in the desert populations of P. kuhlii we recorded stronger adverse reactions only far from human settlements. The harsh reactions that the desert bat species showed towards ALAN rule out any effect of a greater motivation to drink. Illumination had no effect on foraging by most species, except in the forest sites, where Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri increased foraging when the light was on, and in the desert sites, where Hypsugo bodenheimeri decreased foraging in such situations. The progressive human encroachment that is taking place in many world regions on both forests and especially deserts, where few sites for drinking are available, may jeopardize bat populations also through increased exposure to ALAN.",
