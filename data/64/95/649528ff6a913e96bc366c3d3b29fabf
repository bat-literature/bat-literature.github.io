The determined faunal association is the following: Sorex araneus–Sorex coronatus, Neomys cf. fodiens, Talpa sp., Rhinolophus euryale-Rhinolophus mehelyi, Marmota cf. marmota, Eliomys quercinus, Glis glis, Arvicola terrestris, Chionomys nivalis, Microtus arvalis-Microtus agrestis, Microtus lusitanicus, Microtus oeconomus, Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus sylvaticus-Apodemus flavicollis and Oryctolagus cuniculus. These taxa are present in the current fauna of Asturias and Cantabrian Region except for Microtus oeconomus that disappeared from the Iberian Peninsula in historical times and is currently in northernmost Eurasian regions. The fauna of micromammals as a whole seems to indicate a predominantly open space environment, generally of certain moisture meadows and vegetation development at ground level, although there would also be wooded areas of some entity and some watercourse. The presence, although with few remains, of some thermophilic species, and the absence of cold climate indicator species, seem to indicate that the climate during the formation of the fossiliferous deposits would be relatively temperate and humid, probably similar to the current one in the area.",

The micromammal association is the following: Erinaceus europaeus, Crocidura russula, Sorex coronatus, Sorex minutus, Neomys fodiens, Talpa europaea, Galemys pyrenaicus, cf. Miniopterus schreibersii, Chiroptera indet., Pliomys lenki, Microtus arvalis – Microtus agrestis, Microtus lusitanicus, Microtus oeconomus, Chionomys nivalis, Arvicola terrestris, Apodemus sylvaticus –Apodemus flavicollis and Lepus sp. Most of these species are in the present fauna of Cantabria, except Pliomys lenki that got extinct in the last third of the Upper Pleistocene, and Microtus oeconomus that disappeared from the Iberian Peninsula during the Holocene, in historical times, and is nowadays present in northern Euroasiatic regions. There is a great continuity of most of the taxa in all the levels. The faunal association seems to indicate a mainly open environment, in general with wet meadows (and few dry meadows), with good vegetation cover in the soil, with perhaps also some tree-covered areas, and some watercourses. The thermophiles indicators are very scarce, which could indicate that the climate could be a lesser temperate than other Upper Pleistocene periods and the present-day climate in the area.",

This paper deals with the study of the following identified micromammals at the site: Erinaceomorpha: Erinaceus europaeus; Soricomorpha: Crocidura russula; Chiroptera: Rhinolophus ferrumequinum; Rodentia: Eliomys quercinus quercinus, Apodemus sp., Cricetulus (Allocricetus) bursae, Arvicola aff. sapidus, Microtus cabrerae, Microtus duodecimcostatus; Lagomorpha: Oryctolagus cuniculus. This faunal association, mainly due to the presence of Microtus cabrerae, belongs to the Late Pleistocene. The evolved stage of Microtus cabrerae and Arvicola aff. sapidus indicate the antiquity of this association within the first part of this period, which is consistent with the date of 84±5,6 ka BP obtained by OSL. All the taxa recorded in PRERESA are currently living in the area where the site is located, except Cricetulus (Allocricetus) bursae that became extinct in the Iberian Peninsula at the end of the Late Pleistocene. Observations on the material indicate that the accumulation of the small mammal remains could have been mainly caused by predators, most likely by pellets of birds of prey. The association of small mammals from PRERESA indicates temperate conditions with some moisture and vegetation development with some wooded areas and mainly open areas but mostly shrubby, herbaceous, wet and dry grasslands, and riparian vegetation. The comparison of the small mammals from PRERESA with those of the Middle Pleistocene sites from Áridos and Valdocarros, indicate a similarity of the climatic conditions and lansdcape in the low sections of the Manzanares and Jarama rivers in the moments that these sites represent (the advanced Middle Pleistocene and the first third of the Late Pleistocene). However, and as it is the case today, these conditions would be somewhat different in the Lozoya valley in the Sierra de Guadarrama during the first third of the Late Pleistocene, as the association of micromammals from Cueva del Camino (Pinilla del Valle) indicate, that suggests a relatively more humid climate and an environment with a greater variety of habitats. The association of small mammals from the Late Pleistocene site of PRERESA from the low section of the Manzanares valley, compared with that from Cueva del Camino that has a similar chronology, and with those of others sites of del Late Pleistocene from the North of Madrid, after our observations suggests a paleoclimate and biogeographic differentiation among those already during this period, which limiting area would be roughly the southern and eastern foothills of the Central System.",

            "abstractNote": "Hendra virus (HeV) was ﬁrst described in 1994 in an outbreak of acute and highly lethal disease in horses and humans in Australia. Equine cases continue to be diagnosed periodically, yet the predisposing factors for infection remain unclear. We undertook an analysis of equine submissions tested for HeV by the Queensland government veterinary reference laboratory over a 20-year period to identify and investigate any patterns. We found a marked increase in testing from July 2008, primarily reﬂecting a broadening of the HeV clinical case deﬁnition. Peaks in submissions for testing, and visitations to the Government HeV website, were associated with reported equine incidents. Signiﬁcantly differing between-year HeV detection rates in north and south Queensland suggest a fundamental difference in risk exposure between the two regions. The statistical association between HeV detection and stockhorse type may suggest that husbandry is a more important risk determinant than breed per se. The detection of HeV in horses with neither neurological nor respiratory signs poses a risk management challenge for attending veterinarians and laboratory staff, reinforcing animal health authority recommendations that appropriate risk management strategies be employed for all sick horses, and by anyone handling sick horses or associated biological samples.",

A total of 4546 oropharyngeal swab samples from 18 bat species were screened for the presence of EBLV-1- , EBLV-2- and BBLV-speciﬁc RNA. Overall, 0·15% of oropharyngeal swab samples tested EBLV-1 positive, with the majority originating from Eptesicus serotinus. Interestingly, out of seven RT–PCR-positive oropharyngeal swabs subjected to virus isolation, viable virus was isolated from a single serotine bat (E. serotinus). Additionally, about 1226 blood samples were tested serologically, and varying virus neutralizing antibody titres were found in at least eight different bat species. The detection of viral RNA and seroconversion in repeatedly sampled serotine bats indicates long-term circulation of the virus in a particular bat colony. The limitations of random-based active bat rabies surveillance over passive bat rabies surveillance and its possible application of targeted approaches for future research activities on bat lyssavirus dynamics and maintenance are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat boxes are commonly used as a conservation tool. Detailed knowledge on the inﬂuence of box elements on microclimate is lacking, despite eco-physiological implications for bats. Summer and winter box temperature and relative humidity patterns were studied in narrow multi-chambered plywood and wood-cement boxes in eastern Australia. Box exteriors were black or white and plywood boxes comprised vents. Relative humidity was higher in white boxes than black boxes and box colour, construction material, chamber sequence and vents inﬂuenced temperatures. Maximum box temperature differences between designs varied by up to 9.0 ◦C in summer and 8.5 ◦C in winter. The black plywood box consistently recorded the warmest temperatures. This design comprised a temperature gradient between chambers and within the front chamber (inﬂuenced by vent). During the 32-day summer sampling period, the front chamber rarely recorded temperatures over 40.0 ◦C (postulated upper thermal tolerance limit of bats), while the third and fourth chamber never reached this threshold. At the study site, the tested black boxes are considered most thermally suitable for bats during average summer conditions. However, during temperature extremes black boxes likely become too hot. Wood-cement, a durable material not previously tested in Australia should be considered as an alternative construction material.",

Bats are very sensitive to artiﬁcial light at night because they are obligate nocturnal and feed on insects which are often also responsive to lights. Here we tested the effects of LED lighting on prey-predator interactions at riverine ecosystems, using bats and their insect prey as models, and compared bat and insect reactions in terms of bat activity and prey insect abundance and diversity, respectively, on artiﬁcially lit vs. unlit nights. Artiﬁcial light inﬂuenced both insect and bat assemblages in taxon-speciﬁc directions: insect abundances increased at lit sites, particularly due to an increase in small dipterans near the light source. Composition of insect assemblages also differed signiﬁcantly between lit and unlit sites. Total bat activity declined at lit sites, but this change was mainly due to the response of the most abundant species, Myotis daubentonii, while opportunistic species showed no reaction or even an opposite pattern (Pipistrellus kuhlii). We show that artiﬁcial lighting along rivers may affect trophic interactions between bats and insects, resulting in a profound alteration of community structure and dynamics.",

Bats are one group utilizing protected areas, but it is unclear what makes an ideal place for bats to live in parks, especially since preferences vary between open and forest foraging species and at different scales. The main objective of this study was to determine the landscape and vegetation factors at multiple scales most associated with higher bat activity and species richness in protected parks. Total bat activity, species richness, and activity for open and forested foraging species were compared to small-scale data vegetation structure collected in the ﬁeld and larger-scale landscape data calculated in ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS. Bat activity and species richness increased with higher percentages of dry and open land cover types such as sand barrens, savanna, cropland, and upland prairie and decreased with higher percentages of forest and wet prairies. Patch richness, understory height, and clutter at the 3–6.5 m level were negatively associated with total bat activity. The most important variables for bats differed depending on spatial scale measured and if species were open or forest adapted. When managing for bats in parks, it would be advantageous to restore open land cover types such as savanna and mid-level clutter, and excessive fragmentation. Whether species are open or forest adapted and scale-speciﬁc differences should also be considered.",

            "abstractNote": "Many animal species, including many species of bats, exhibit collective behavior where groups of individuals coordinate their motion. Bats are unique among these animals in that they use the active sensing mechanism of echolocation as their primary means of navigation. Due to their use of echolocation in large groups, bats run the risk of signal interference from sonar jamming. However, several species of bats have developed strategies to prevent interference, which may lead to different behavior when ﬂying with conspeciﬁcs than when ﬂying alone. This study seeks to explore the role of this acoustic sensing on the behavior of bat pairs ﬂying together. Field data from a maternity colony of gray bats (Myotis grisescens) were collected using an array of cameras and microphones. These data were analyzed using the information theoretic measure of transfer entropy in order to quantify the interaction between pairs of bats and to determine the effect echolocation calls have on this interaction. This study expands on previous work that only computed information theoretic measures on the 3D position of bats without echolocation calls or that looked at the echolocation calls without using information theoretic analyses. Results show that there is evidence of information transfer between bats ﬂying in pairs when time series for the speed of the bats and their turning behavior are used in the analysis. Unidirectional information transfer was found in some subsets of the data which could be evidence of a leader–follower interaction.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the level of mortality from road kills on this colony, verify which species were being killed in traffic and examine the influence of canopy height and structure on flight behavior. On 10 evenings between 15 May and 26 July 2001, bats were counted as they emerged from day roosts and crossed a heavily trafficked highway en route to foraging areas. A total of 26 442 bats were observed crossing this highway over 9.29 h of observation. Bats used canopy cover when approaching the highway from roosts. Where canopy cover was lacking adjacent to the highway, fewer bats were counted crossing; where adjacent canopy was low (≤6 m), bats crossed lower and closer to traffic. Motivated by a planned highway upgrade that would extend deforestation of the highway verge, we monitored the flight behavior of M. lucifugus as they crossed a 55 m mowed field. Observations of more than 1700 bats revealed that a vast majority of commuting individuals fly less than 2 m above the ground in the open field. Between 15 May and 14 September 2001, searches for road-killed bats were conducted along a section of highway crossed by large numbers of bats. We collected 27 road-killed M. lucifugus, 1 suspected M. sodalis and 1 unidentifiable Myotis sp. Subsequent genetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences confirmed the suspect bat as a federally endangered M. sodalis.",

However, few translocations of bats have been attempted and we know of no successes. The few translocations which have been attempted have either failed due to dispersal from the release site or have not been monitored sufficiently to determine the cause of failure. We assessed the shortterm success of a translocation of lesser short-tailed bats Mystacina tuberculata by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, where 3 release methods were used to minimise dispersal or mortality: bats were juveniles, were maintained in captivity at the release site, and were provided with supplementary food and roosts following release. Success was assessed by determining if founders remained at the release site and maintained condition (weight). Recapture showed that at least 9 of the 20 bats remained at the release site 232 d after release. There was weak evidence that bats lost weight, although final weights were comparable to those of bats from a natural population. However, all bats captured 8 mo after release had damaged, infected ears and some were balding. The problem was treated but recurred, and bats were returned to captivity. Our results are the first to demonstrate that translocated bats can remain at their release site and survive. However, disease may be an issue in future translocations.",

Fourteen mammalian species were recorded in this survey. Four species were recorded from the Oasis for the first time, namely, the charming dipodil, Dipodillus amoenus; shaw's jird, Meriones shawi; the house rat, Rattus rattus; and the red fox, Vulpes vulpes. The house rat and the red fox undoubtedly invaded the Oasis as a result of the urban and agricultural development in this part of Egypt. On the other hand, eight of the mammalian species known to occur in Siwa were not recorded in this survey; some of them are vulnerable, threatened, or endangered. Morphometric comparison study carried out between Gerbillus gerbillus collected from Siwa and that collected from the Mediterranean Coastal Desert as well as a comparison between different color variants of Dipodillus campestris revealed the presence of some significant and highly significant differences between them.",

            "abstractNote": "Metal elements, ubiquitous in the environment, can cause negative eﬀects in long-lived organisms even after low but prolonged exposure. Insectivorous bats living near metal emission sources can be vulnerable to such contaminants. Although it is known that bats can bioaccumulate metals, little information exists on the eﬀects of metal elements on their physiological status. For example, oxidative status markers are known to vary after detoxiﬁcation processes and immune reactions. Here, for two consecutive summers, we sampled individuals from a natural population of the insectivorous bat, Myotis daubentonii, inhabiting a site close to a metal emission source. We quantiﬁed metals and metalloids (As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn) from individual fecal pellets. We measured enzymatic antioxidants (GP, CAT, SOD), total glutathione (tGSH) and ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) from their red blood cells together with biometrics, hematocrit and parasite prevalence. In general, metal concentrations in feces of M. daubentonii reﬂected the exposure to ambient contamination. This was especially evident in the higher concentrations of Cd, Co, Cu and Ni close to a smelter compared to a site with less contaminant exposure. Annual diﬀerences were also observed for most elements quantiﬁed. Sex-speciﬁc diﬀerences were observed for calcium and zinc excretion. SOD and CAT enzymatic activities were associated with metal levels (principal components of six metal elements), suggesting early signs of chronic stress in bats. The study also shows promise for the use of non-invasive sampling to assess the metal exposure on an individual basis and metal contamination in the environment.",

This hypothesis predicts that variation in the geographic area of biomes (rather than their particular environmental conditions) is the best predictor of mammal species richness. The areal effect is expected to be stronger after tropical species are excluded from the analysis, because the spillover of these species into extra-tropical latitudes can mask the species-area relationship. A latitudinal gradient in mammal species richness is confirmed in South America, although the pattern is stronger in bats than in non-volant quadrupeds. Values of species richness estimated from equal area samples (‘species density’) reveal that species richness of different mammal taxa peaks at different latitudes. The species density pattern in the mammal species assemblage taken as a whole offers support to the geographic area hypothesis after excluding tropical species from the analyses. The number of principally extra-tropical (PE-T) mammal species per unit area depends on the biome area. In contrast, bats and rodents taken separately do not support the geographic area hypothesis at this cell-scaled analysis. At the scale of biomes, the variation in the geographic area of different macrohabitats is the best predictor of mammal species richness. The species richness-area relationship holds even after controlling for the effect of latitude and differences in mean net primary productivity of the different macrohabitats. There is a difference between bats and rodents, to the extent that a strong species richness-area relationship is observed for rodents at the biome-scaled analysis. Excluding tropical species does not enhance the species richness-area relationship at this scale, thus suggesting that the ability to capture the impact of the spillover effect of tropical species into extra-tropical latitudes might depend on the scale of habitat analysis.",

            "abstractNote": "Mounting evidence indicates the non-­consumptive effects of predators significantly impact prey physiology, ecology and behaviour. Passerine birds experience adverse effects on nesting and reproductive success when in proximity to predators. Fear of predators is context-­dependent and influenced by hunting habitats and foraging strategies. While some bat species prey on birds, the greater noctule (Nyctalus lasiopterus) stands out by specialising in avian prey, especially during peak bird migration. N. lasiopterus is thought to seize avian prey in flight, but direct evidence is lacking. If birds were taken from nests, they would likely avoid nesting near these bats. However, no observations support this view. This study documents the successful reproduction of Eurasian blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) nesting alongside a colony of approximately 25 greater noctules. This bird species is a prey species for greater noctules in Italy. Over about 1 month (April–May 2023), we observed parent birds provisioning food to chicks, with at least two chicks alive and fed outside the tree cavity by the end of the period. While acknowledging the limitations of a single observation, we propose that this previously unknown behaviour indirectly supports the idea that greater noctules only capture avian prey in flight, not within confined spaces. This observation challenges the perception that these bats pose a threat when sharing roosting spaces in trees, as evidenced in our observed case. We hope this novel observation inspires future research on variations in bird nesting behaviour and reproductive success in the presence of bird-­eating bats, as well as an assessment of the long-­term impact on population dynamics and reproductive success of nesting birds sharing such roosting spaces.",

            "abstractNote": "Animal size, a trait sensitive to spatial and temporal variables, is a key element in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In the context of climate change, there is evidence that some bat species are increasing their body size via phenotypic responses to higher temperatures at maternity roosts. To test the generality of this response, we conducted a >20-­year study examining body size changes in 15 bat species in Italy, analysing data from 4393 individual bats captured since 1995. In addition to examining the temporal effect, we considered the potential influence of sexual dimorphism and, where relevant, included latitude and altitude as potential drivers of body size change. Contrary to initial predictions of a widespread increase in size, our findings challenge this assumption, revealing a nuanced interplay of factors contributing to the complexity of bat body size dynamics. Specifically, only three species (Myotis daubentonii, Nyctalus leisleri, and Pipistrellus pygmaeus) out of the 15 exhibited a discernible increase in body size over the studied period, prompting a reassessment of bats as reliable indicators of climate change based on alterations in body size. Our investigation into influencing factors highlighted the significance of temperature-­related variables, with latitude and altitude emerging as crucial drivers. In some cases, this mirrored patterns consistent with Bergmann's rule, revealing larger bats recorded at progressively higher latitudes (Plecotus auritus, Myotis mystacinus, and Miniopterus schreibersii) or altitudes (Pipistrellus kuhlii). We also observed a clear sexual dimorphism effect in most species, with females consistently larger than males. The observed increase in size over time in three species suggests the occurrence of phenotypic plasticity, raising questions about potential long-­term selective pressures on larger individuals. The unresolved question of whether temperature-­related changes in body size reflect microevolutionary processes or phenotypic plastic responses adds further complexity to our understanding of body size patterns in bats over time and space.",

Cardioderma cor, the heart-n­ osed bat, is one of the few species of bats known to sing during nighttime foraging. Previous research found that heart-n­ osed bats react aggressively to song playback, supporting the territorial defense hypothesis of singing in this species. We further investigated the territorial defense hypothesis from an ecological standpoint, which predicts that singing should be associated with exclusive areas containing a resource, by tracking 14 individuals nightly during the dry seasons in Tanzania. We quantified the singing behavior of individuals at all perches used throughout the night. Using home range analysis tools, we quantified overall use, night ranges and singing ranges, as well as areas used in early and later time periods at night. Males sang back and forth from small (x = 3.48 ± 2.71 ha), largely exclusive areas that overlapped with overall night ranges used for gleaning prey. Individuals varied in singing effort; however, all sang significantly more as night progressed. Subsequently, areas used earlier at night and overall use areas were both larger than singing areas. Individuals varied in singing strategies. Some males sang for long periods in particular trees and had smaller core areas, while others moved frequently among singing trees. The most prolific singers used more perches overall. Our results support the hypothesis that acoustic communication repertoires evolved in support of stable foraging territory advertisement and defense in some bats.",

There is growing concern that land-­based wind development in North America is negatively impacting bat populations, primarily long-­distance migrating bats, but the impacts to bats from offshore wind energy are unknown. Bats are associated with the terrestrial environment, but have been observed over the ocean. In this review, we synthesize historic and contemporary accounts of bats observed and acoustically recorded in the North American marine environment to ascertain the spatial and temporal distribution of bats flying offshore. We incorporate studies of offshore bats in Europe and of bat behavior at land-­based wind energy studies to examine how offshore wind development could impact North American bat populations. We find that most offshore bat records are of long-­distance migrating bats and records occur during autumn migration, the period of highest fatality rates for long-­distance migrating bats at land-­based wind facilities in North America. We summarize evidence that bats may be attracted to offshore turbines, potentially increasing their exposure to risk of collision. However, higher wind speeds offshore can potentially reduce the amount of time that bats are exposed to risk. We identify knowledge gaps and hypothesize that a combination of operational minimization strategies may be the most effective approach for reducing impacts to bats and maximizing offshore energy production.",

            "abstractNote": "In summer, many temperate bat species use daytime torpor, but breeding females do so less to avoid interferences with reproduction. In forest-­roosting bats, deep tree cavities buffer roost microclimate from abrupt temperature oscillations and facilitate thermoregulation. Forest bats also switch roosts frequently, so thermally suitable cavities may be limiting. We tested how barbastelle bats (Barbastella barbastellus), often roosting beneath flaking bark in snags, may thermoregulate successfully despite the unstable microclimate of their preferred cavities. We assessed thermoregulation patterns of bats roosting in trees in a beech forest of central Italy. Although all bats used torpor, females were more often normothermic. Cavities were poorly insulated, but social thermoregulation probably overcomes this problem. A model incorporating the presence of roost mates and group size explained thermoregulation patterns better than others based, respectively, on the location and structural characteristics of tree roosts and cavities, weather, or sex, reproductive or body condition. Homeothermy was recorded for all subjects, including nonreproductive females: This probably ensures availability of a warm roosting environment for nonvolant juveniles. Homeothermy may also represent a lifesaver for bats roosting beneath loose bark, very exposed to predators, because homeothermic bats may react quickly in case of emergency. We also found that barbastelle bats maintain group cohesion when switching roosts: This may accelerate roost occupation at the end of a night, quickly securing a stable microclimate in the newly occupied cavity. Overall, both thermoregulation and roost-­switching patterns were satisfactorily explained as adaptations to a structurally and thermally labile roosting environment.",

            "abstractNote": "We present a framework for biodiversity metrics that organizes the growing panoply of metrics. Our framework distinguishes metrics based on the type of information–abundance, phylogeny, function–and two common properties–magnitude and variability. Our new metrics of phylogenetic diversity are based on a partition of the total branch lengths of a cladogram into the proportional share of each species, including: a measure of divergence which standardizes the amount of evolutionary divergence by species richness and time depth of the cladogram; a measure of regularity which is maximal when the tree is perfectly symmetrical so that all species have the same proportional branch lengths; a measure that combines information on the magnitude and variability of abundance with phylogenetic variability, and a measure of phylogenetically weighted effective mean abundance; and indicate how those metrics can be decomposed into α and β components. We illustrate the utility of these new metrics using empirical data on the bat fauna of Manu, Peru. Divergence was greatest in lowland rainforest and at the transition between cloud and elfin forests, and least in upper elfin forests and in cloud forests. In contrast, regularity was greatest in lowland rainforest, dipping to its smallest values in mid-­elevation cloud forests, and then increasing in high elevation elfin forests. These patterns indicate that the first species to drop out with increasing elevation are ones that are closely related to other species in the metacommunity. Measures of the effective number of phylogenetically independent or distinct species decreased very rapidly with elevation, and β-­diversity was larger. In contrast, a comparison of feeding guilds shows a different effect of phylogenetic patterning. Along the elevational gradient, each guild generally loses some species from each clade–rather than entire clades–explaining the maintenance of functional diversity as phylogenetic diversity decreases.",

As animals need to adapt to multiple habitat and environmental conditions throughout their range, variation in group composition should be inﬂuenced by adaptive adjustment to different ecological factors. Relevant to anthropogenic disturbance, increased habitat modiﬁcation by humans can alter species’ presence, density, and population structure. Therefore, it is important to understand the consequences of changes to landscape composition, in particular how habitat modiﬁcation affects social structure of group-forming organisms. Here, we combine information on roosting associations with genetic structure of Peter’s tent-roosting bats, Uroderma bilobatum to address how different habitat characteristics at different scales affect structure of social groups. By dividing analyses by age and sex, we determined that genetic structure was greater for adult females than adult males or offspring. Habitat variables explained 80% of the variation in group relatedness (mainly inﬂuenced by female relatedness) with roost characteristics contributing the most explained variation. This suggests that females using roosts of speciﬁc characteristics exhibit higher relatedness and seem to be philopatric. These females mate with more males than do more labile female groups. Results describe ecological and microevolutionary processes, which affect relatedness and social structure; ﬁndings are highly relevant to species distributions in both natural and human-modiﬁed environments.",

Accurate representation of a species distribution is important for predicting the effects of climate change, land-use change, management activities, disease, and other landscape-level processes on wildlife populations. We developed models to estimate the spatial distribution of little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) wintering populations in the United States east of the 100th meridian, based on known hibernacula locations. From this data, we developed several scenarios of wintering population counts per county that incorporated uncertainty in the spatial distribution of the hibernacula as well as uncertainty in the size of the current little brown bat population. We assessed the variability in our results resulting from effects of uncertainty. Despite considerable uncertainty in the known locations of overwintering little brown bats in the eastern United States, we believe that models accurately depicting the effects of the uncertainty are useful for making management decisions as these models are a coherent organization of the best available information.",

            "abstractNote": "Thirty-one North and Central American bat faunas were examined with multivariate morphometric techniques to determine if faunas of bats found in the tropics are more tightly packed in morphological attribute space than those 'round in temperate latitudes. Eighteen morphological features for each of 103 species of insectivorous bats were measured. The density of morphological packing was calculated from nearest neighbor Euclidean distances between species within each fauna. Nearest neighbor distances were also computed for species' projections on principal component axes for each fauna. For these different character spaces. substantially different patterns emerged. resulting from the correlation of many morphological characters. Morphological packing in these faunas was also compared to levels of packing. predicted from two different neutral models in which species composition was generated by Monte Carlo sampling methods. In one neutral model, species were drawn from the total pool of insectivorous bats. including 11 species which were statistically significant morphological outliers. Frequency distributions of nearest neighbor distances of real and randomly assembled faunas with equal species richness were compared by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Real faunas which did not contain the most significant outliers did not differ from random faunas. Seven faunas, which included outlier species with geographic ranges restricted to the tropics. differed from random cornmunines in the rnajoriry of large numbers of Monte Carlo samples.",

Riparian and woodland habitats constitute an important target for conservation. Typical land use forms such as woodlands used for chestnut production and traditionally managed olive groves should be encouraged in conservation plans. The negative impact of urbanisation on bats might be counteracted by fostering trees, gardens and small cultivated patches. Farmland practices should encourage landscape complexity and limit the use of pesticides.",

We examine how these factors interact to explain spatial variation in mammal species richness in South America. After taking into account the effects of spatial autocorrelation and area, elevation variability and energy mainly drive spatial variation in mammal species richness. The effect of environmental variability is less important. When different taxonomic groups of mammals are analyzed separately, three ways emerge whereby energy and heterogeneity interact to promote species richness. Heterogeneity may have no effect on species richness, habitat heterogeneity and energy availability contribute independently to species richness, or heterogeneity increases in importance with an increase in energy availability. The partition of species into range size quartiles shows that habitat heterogeneity and temporal instability in the resource supply account for the species richness pattern in the narrowest‐ ranging species. Habitat heterogeneity is significant also for intermediate ranging species but not for the widest‐ranging species. Energy alone drives the species richness pattern in the latter species. The interplay between ecology and biogeographic history may ultimately explain these differences given that narrow‐ and wide‐ranging species show distinct biogeographic patterns, and different taxonomic groups also unequally represent them.",

Yet as highly mobile species with multiple needs in the landscape, bats impose serious modelling challenges, such as advanced use of neighbourhood analyses. The aims of this study were to test the use of a designed sampling of bats for biodiversity and conservation assessments, and to find appropriate modelling solutions for providing nature practitioners with reliable potential bat distribution maps in a mountain area of high conservation interest.",

We analyzed a species diversity of bats in three locations with different regimes of anthropic disturbance. We assessed the effect of the season and post-hurricane time on the abundance of trophic guilds in coastal Jalisco, México, during the two years following Hurricane Patricia (category 4). During a sampling effort of 15,629.76 m2 of netting, we captured 790 bats of 21 species. The species diversity was higher in the site with the highest proportion of primary tropical deciduous forest and was higher in 2016 than in 2017; the species composition did not differ greatly between the two years. The abundance of bats in various trophic guilds varied relative to the four climatic seasons. The general abundance of bats, frugivores-omnivores, and insectivores showed a signiﬁcant increasing trend over time after the hurricane, which may indicate a recovery of the ecosystem or an abundance of early-successional fruiting plants. The results also conﬁrm that species diversity recovers faster in a conserved forest. Thus, it is important to conserve natural areas to mitigate the effects of major disturbances.",

            "abstractNote": "Over 40% of the Earth’s surface has been converted to agricultural use and agroecosystems have become important habitats for wildlife. In arid regions, intensive agriculture creates artiﬁcial oasis-like habitats due to their high irrigation inputs. Date production is one of the primary agricultural practices in the deserts of the Middle East and North Africa. Insectivorous bats are known to use agricultural areas, but the role of date plantations as their foraging habits and the importance of insectivorous bats as date bio-pest control agents are still unknown. We assessed the role of date plantations as foraging habitats for local desert bat species by acoustically recording bat activity in conventional and organic date plantations in the southern Arava Valley, Israel. In addition, we captured bats in the plantations and collected feces for DNA metabarcoding analysis to investigate the presence of pest species in their diets. We found that 12 out of the 16 known species of bats in this region frequently used both conventional and organic date plantations as foraging habitats. Species richness was highest in the organic plantation with complex ground vegetation cover. Foraging activity was not affected by plantation type or management. However, bat species richness and activity increased in all plantations during summer date harvesting. Molecular analysis conﬁrmed that bats feed on a variety of important date pests, but the particular pests consumed and the extent of consumption varied among bat species. Our results highlight a win–win situation, whereby date plantations are an important foraging habitat for desert bats, while bats provide bio-pest control services that beneﬁt the date plantations. Therefore, date farmers interested in bio-pest control should manage their plantations to support local desert bat populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Vertical stratiﬁcation is a key component of the biological complexity of rainforests. Understanding community- and species-level responses to disturbance across forest strata is paramount for evidence-based conservation and management. However, even for bats, known to extensively explore multiple layers of the complex three-dimensional forest space, studies are biased towards understory-based surveys and only few assessments of vertical stratiﬁcation were done in fragmented landscapes. Using both ground and canopy mist-nets, we investigated how the vertical structure of bat assemblages is inﬂuenced by forest fragmentation in the experimentally fragmented landscape of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazon, Brazil. Over a three year-period, we captured 3077 individuals of 46 species in continuous forest (CF) and in 1, 10 and 100 ha forest fragments. In both CF and forest fragments, the upper forest strata sustained more diverse bat assemblages than the equivalent understory layer, and the midstory layers had signiﬁcantly higher bat abundance in fragments than in CF. Artibeus lituratus and Rhinophylla pumilio exhibited signiﬁcant shifts in their vertical stratiﬁcation patterns between CF and fragments (e.g., R. pumilio was more associated with the upper strata in fragments than in CF). Altogether, our study suggests that fragmentation modulates the vertical stratiﬁcation of bat assemblages.",

We tested whether bat passage rates through rotor-swept airspace diﬀer between groups of wind turbines where bat fatalities were found and not found during next-morning dog searches for fatalities. Passage rates diﬀered signiﬁcantly and averaged four times higher where freshly killed bats were found in next-morning fatality searches. Rates of near misses and risky ﬂight behaviors also diﬀered signiﬁcantly between groups of turbines where bats were found and not found, and rate of near misses averaged eight times higher where bat fatalities were found in next-morning searches. Hours of turbine operation averaged signiﬁcantly higher, winds averaged more westerly, and the moon averaged more visible among turbines where and when bat fatalities were found. Although dogs found only one of four bats seen colliding with turbine blades, they found many more bat fatalities than did human-only searchers at the same wind projects, and our fatality estimates were considerably higher. Our rates of observed bat collisions, adjusted for the rates of unseen collisions, would predict four to seven times the fresh fatalities we found using dogs between two wind projects. Despite markedly improved carcass detection through use of dogs, best estimates of bat fatalities might still be biased low due to crippling bias and search radius bias.",

            "abstractNote": "High-ﬂying insectivorous bats, as wide-ranging generalist insectivores, are valuable consumers of high-altitude migrating pests of rice in Southeast Asia. Here, we documented the behavior of relatively low-ﬂying bats over irrigated rice to elucidate their potential role as predators of rice-associated pest insects in the Philippines. Speciﬁcally, we tested the local-scale eﬀects of rice stage, particularly seedling and late vegetative stages, and time of night on acoustic activity of bats foraging near ground level within three functional guilds (based on foraging distance from background clutter). We also monitored bat activity from two 50 m-high towers to assess the vertical extent of relatively low-ﬂying guilds, as well as document high-ﬂying bat guild presence and temporal behavior. At ground level, the most active guild biased their activity and feeding over early growth stage ﬁelds, but also foraged at tower level. Activity of the bat guild adept at foraging closest to vegetation did not vary with time of night or rice stage and was absent from tower recordings. High-ﬂying bats were predictably rare at rice level, but exhibited high foraging intensity at 50 m. Given the well-documented, sequential arrival of insect guilds with growth stage, these data suggest that at ground level edge-space bats may be important consumers of detritivores (e.g., mosquitoes). Moreover, our data suggest that just as habitat heterogeneity enhances the services of arthropod predators, these management practices also enhance bat activity and, presumably, their contribution to pest suppression.",

However, due to the limited number of G-bands in respective karyotypes and to the similarity of non-homologous bands, an accurate evolutionary history of chromosome segments remains questionable. This is the case for vampire bats (Desmodontinae). Despite several proposed homologies, banding data have not yet provided a detailed understanding of the chromosomal changes within vampire genera. We examined karyotype differentiation of the 3 species within this subfamily using whole chromosomal probes from <i>Phyllostomus hastatus </i>(Phyllostominae) and <i>Carollia brevicauda </i>(Carolliinae). Painting probes of <i>P. hastatus </i>respectively detected 22, 21 and 23 conserved segments in <i>Diphylla ecaudata</i>,<i> Diaemus youngi</i>, and <i>Desmodus rotundus</i> karyotypes, whereas 27, 27 and 28 were respectively detectedwith <i>C. brevicauda </i>paints. Based on the evolutionary relationships proposed by morphological and molecular data, we present probable chromosomal synapomorphies for vampire bats and propose chromosomes that were present in the common ancestor of the 5 genera analyzed. Karyotype comparisons allowed us to relate a number of conserved chromosomal segments among the 5 species, providing a broader database for understanding karyotype evolution in the family.",

            "abstractNote": "We tested the prediction that at coarse spatial scales, variables associated with climate, energy, and productivity hypotheses should be better predictor(s) of bat species richness than those associated with environmental heterogeneity. Distribution ranges of 64 bat species were estimated with niche-based models informed by 3629 verified museum specimens. The influence of environmental correlates on bat richness was assessed using ordinary least squares regression (OLS), simultaneous autoregressive models (SAR), conditional autoregressive models (CAR), spatial eigenvector-based filtering models (SEVM), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). To test the assumption of stationarity, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was used. Bat species richness was highest in the eastern parts of southern Africa, particularly in central Zimbabwe and along the western border of Mozambique. We found support for the predictions of both the habitat heterogeneity and climate/productivity/energy hypotheses, and as we expected, support varied among bat families and model selection. Richness patterns and predictors of Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae clearly differed from those of other bat families. Altitude range was the only independent variable that was significant in all models and it was most often the best predictor of bat richness. Standard coefficients of SAR and CAR models were similar to those of OLS models, while those of SEVM models differed. Although GWR indicated that the assumption of stationarity was violated, the CART analysis corroborated the findings of the curve-fitting models. Our results identify where additional data on current species ranges, and future conservation action and ecological work are needed [Current Zoology 59 (3): 279–293, 2013].",

            "abstractNote": "Mutualisms between plants and animals shape the world’s ecosystems [1, 2]. In such interactions, achieving contact with the partner species is imperative. Plants regularly advertise themselves with signals that speciﬁcally appeal to the partner’s perceptual preferences [3–5]. For example, many plants have acquired traits such as brightly colored, fragrant ﬂowers that attract pollinators with visual, olfactory, or—in the case of a few bat-pollinated ﬂowers—even acoustic stimuli in the form of echo-reﬂecting structures [6–9]. However, acoustic attraction in plants is rare compared to other advertisements and has never been found outside the pollination context and only in the Neotropics. We hypothesized that this phenomenon is more widespread and more diverse as plantbat interactions also occur in the Paleotropics. In Borneo, mutualistic bats fertilize a carnivorous pitcher plant while roosting in its pitchers [10, 11]. The pitcher’s oriﬁce features a prolonged concave structure, which we predicted to distinctively reﬂect the bats’ echolocation calls for a wide range of angles. This structure should facilitate the location and identiﬁcation of pitchers even within highly cluttered surroundings. Pitchers lacking this structure should be less attractive for the bats. Ensoniﬁcations of the pitchers around their oriﬁce revealed that this structure indeed acts as a multidirectional ultrasound reﬂector. In behavioral experiments where bats were confronted with differently modiﬁed pitchers, the reﬂector’s presence clearly facilitated the ﬁnding and identiﬁcation of pitchers. These results suggest that plants have convergently acquired reﬂectors in the Paleotropics and the Neotropics to acoustically attract bats, albeit for completely different ecological reasons.",

            "abstractNote": "A better understanding of environmental factors driving natural pest regulation is a major challenge for designing sustainable cropping systems. The objective of the present study was to assess the association between vegetation openness in traditional tree-crop agroforestry systems in Senegal, richness and abundance of verte­ brates including insectivorous birds and bats, and their contribution to the natural regulation of crop pests. The millet head miner (MHM), Heliocheilus albipunctella (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), a major constraint to increasing millet crop productivity in sub-Saharan Africa, was selected as a model system. Ten sites separated by at least one km from each other were selected in a 100 km2 study area in the Peanut basin in Senegal. In each site, a pair of millet fields distant from at least 100 m each was selected according to a gradient of vegetation openness within a 100-m radius buffer with sampling plot (5 � 5 m) at the center. Nine insectivorous bird and bat species were recorded in millet fields over the 2017 cropping season and their predator status was confirmed by direct observation or DNA detection in fecal samples. Grain losses were reduced when panicles were accessible to birds and bats, confirming their net contribution to pest regulation. At a local scale, tree diversity and vegetation openness were important predictors of the abundance of insectivorous village weaver birds and grey-headed sparrows, respectively. Some tree species (soapberry trees and neems) indirectly contributed to natural regula­ tion of the MHM likely by providing refuges to insectivorous vertebrates whereas other tree species (baobabs) provided disservices as possible refuges for the MHM moths. Further research is needed to better understand relationships between tree cover, food web interactions and natural pest suppression, so that specific conser­ vation measures such as habitat management can be designed to improve pest control.",
