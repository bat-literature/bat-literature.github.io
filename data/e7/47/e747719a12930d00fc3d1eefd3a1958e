            "abstractNote": "Pestiviruses are plus-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridae. They comprise several important pathogens like classical swine fever virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus that induce economically important animal diseases. In 2017, the last update of pestivirus taxonomy resulted in demarcation of 11 species designated Pestivirus A through Pestivirus K. Since then, multiple new pestiviruses have been reported including pathogens associated with disease in pigs or small ruminants. In addition, pestivirus sequences have been found during metagenomics analysis of different non-ungulate hosts (bats, rodents, whale, and pangolin), but the consequences of this pestivirus diversity for animal health still need to be established. To provide a systematic classiﬁcation of the newly discovered viruses, we analyzed the genetic relationship based on complete coding sequences (cds) and deduced polyprotein sequences and calculated pairwise distances that allow species demarcation. In addition, phylogenetic analysis was performed based on a highly conserved region within the non-structural protein NS5B. Taking into account the genetic relationships observed together with available information about antigenic properties, host origin, and characteristics of disease, we propose to expand the number of pestivirus species to 19 by adding eight additional species designated Pestivirus L through Pestivirus S.",

However, bat populations are declining worldwide and conservation efforts are needed to conserve bat species throughout the world. Worldwide, superstitions and fear of bats prevail and prolong negative attitudes and human hostility toward most bat species. In the case of other species (e.g. wolves and alligators), tourism efforts have led to improving attitudes and species viability. These examples suggest that bat tourism has a potential to conserve bat populations while providing social and economic benefits to local people in host communities. This article adopts an existing definition of non-consumptive wildlife-oriented recreation to frame the issues, summarises the ecological importance of bat species, provides an overview of the existing bat-human relationship, and adopts guidance from existing wildlife tourism initiatives. Information based on studies of wildlife tourists seeking other species is presented, as are examples of bat conservation initiatives based on tourism to change attitudes toward bats while stressing awareness of both potential negative impacts on bat species and economic benefits for local communities. Several existing examples of destinations which are attracting tourists to view bats, are discussed.",

Herein, we studied the relationship between ectoparasitic infections with the wing mite (Spinturnix myoti) and the size of the breeding colonies, sex, age, and body condition index (BCI) of its host, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). The influence of environmental quality in the Carpathian Mountains (Poland) was also examined. We found significant differences in mite abundance and BCI between different breeding aggregations of the greater mouse-eared bat and also between the host sex/age categories. The most heavily infected bats were adult M. myotis females, while young males appeared to be the least infected. The BCI differed significantly between the sexes in young bats (males had a higher BCI than females) and also between colonies. No significant differences in the BCI were found for adult females. We did not find any relationship between the infestation rate of M. myotis, their colony size, the quality of environmental resources (percentage of forest cover around the colony), or the BCI. The prevalence of the various developmental stages of the mites did not differ between the host sex/age categories; however, differences were found in the sex ratios of deutonymphs and adult mites between adult M. myotis females. We predict that parasite load may not be dependent on colony size itself, but mainly on microclimatic factors, which are in turn directly correlated with colony size.",

The two methods may not provide the same data regarding species composi tion. Mist nets and harp traps may be biased towards samp ling low flying spec ies, and bat detectors biased towards detecting high intensity echo locators. A comparison of the bat fauna of Fazenda Intervales, southeastern Brazil, as revealed by mist nets and harp trap captures, checking roosts and by monitoring echolocation calls offlying bats illustrates this point. A total of 17 species ofbats was sampled. F0U11een bat species were captured and the echolocation calls of 12 species were recorded, three of them not revealed by mist nets or harp traps. The different sampling methods provided dilTerent pictures of the bat fauna. Phyllostomid bats dominated the catches in mist nets, but in the field their echolocation calls were never detected. No single sampling approach provided a complete assessment of the bat fauna in the study area. In general, bats producing low intensity echolocation calls, such as phyllostomids, are more easily assessed by netting, and bats producing high intensity echolocation calls are better surveyed by bat detectors. The results demonstrate that a combined and varied approach to sampling is required for a complete assessment of th e bat fauna of an area.",

To explore the potential for social factors to modulate reproductive seasonality, the in¯uence of social and environmental cues on birth timing was examined in greater spear-nosed bats Phyllostomus hastatus. Births were observed or dated from pup growth curves in three caves on Trinidad, West Indies, over 4 years. Nearly 40% of the variability in birth dates could be explained by environmental factors because birth dates differed signi®cantly between years and showed consistent differences between locations that receive differing rainfall amounts. Nevertheless, the timing of births within caves and in captivity indicated that social cues also affect the timing and synchrony of births within female social groups. Within each cave, social groups differed signi®cantly in mean birth dates. Two groups of greater spear-nosed bats brought into captivity and maintained without seasonal cues initially exhibited less birth synchrony than wild groups, but birth synchrony did not decline over 3 subsequent years. Further evidence for the in¯uence of social cues on reproductive timing came from four females that were transferred between the captive groups and then gave birth in synchrony with their new group and out of schedule with their original group. Social cues in¯uencing reproductive timing are unlikely to be volatile chemicals or other passively transferred cues, given that frequent prolonged physical contact did not increase birth synchrony between adjacent wild groups. Cues are more probably transferred actively between female group members, perhaps by grooming, or through mating with one attendant male.",

Some analyses of the mitochondrial and combined data sets indicate that round-eared bats may be paraphyletic relative to the genera Phyllostomus, Phylloderma, and Mimon. Both nuclear and mitochondrial data sets indicate substantial genetic divergence between Tonatia and Lophostoma, and neither data set unambiguously demonstrates monophyly of round-eared bats. However, our analyses cannot exclude the possibility that round-eared bats form a monophyletic lineage that separated anciently into Tonatia and Lophostoma. Within the Tonatia lineage, T. bidens and T. saurophila are sister taxa but are divergent for both nuclear and mitochondrial sequences. Nuclear data suggest that L. silvicolum may be paraphyletic, as currently recognized, because L. evotis appears within this clade.",

Phylogenetic analyses of both data sets supported 4 primary lineages within Micronycteris, which we recognize as subgenera: Leuconycteris new subgenus (M. brosseti), Micronycteris Gray (M. megalotis, M. microtis, M. matses, and M. giovanniae), Schizonycteris new subgenus (M. minuta, M. schimdtorum, and M. sanborni), and Xenoctenes Miller (M. hirsuta). Although we provisionally recognize the current alpha taxonomy within Micronycteris, our results did not support monophyly of M. microtis as the name is currently applied. Our results further indicate that cryptic species probably exist within the taxa currently recognized as M. megalotis and M. minuta and possibly M. hirsuta. Additional studies, including thorough geographic sampling and detailed morphological and molecular data sets, are necessary to test our genealogic hypotheses and assess the biodiversity within Micronycteris.",

The development of concrete localized conservation measures requires detailed quantitative data to assess habitat status regarding the most crucial factors for concrete species. This chapter aims, by modeling using a Maxent based on many georeferenced locations and the state of ecologically relevant ecogeographic variables, to reveal the spatial trends in the habitat suitability of 29 bat species; to obtain meaningful biogeographical species groups; and to provide a countrywide quantitative assessment of bat richness, rarity, and vulnerability. The modeling results showed that altitude, karstic areas (presence of caves), topographic wetness index, and presence of deciduous forests were the most influential factors. In this respect, three well-defined groups were delineated. The species’ richest areas were mostly located in semimountain karstic areas with a well-developed broadleaved forests, and the lowest in xerophilous, bare habitats, especially those of anthropogenic origin. Regarding rarity, more rare species were associated with caves and mountains. Vulnerability (in terms of IUCN criteria) was positively affected by the presence of caves showing the importance of protecting karstic areas.",

            "abstractNote": "The effects of habitat fragmentation on animalivorous bats were studied on recent forest islands created in 1994, at the time of the filling of Petit Saut dam in French Guiana A sampling strategy, including control sites located in a nearby forested area not fragmented during the whole study period (1993-1997) was designed. Modifications affecting animalivorous bat communities in a remote 28 ha island (island 2) and in 15 islets smaller than 6 ha more or less isolated from the nearby continuous forest were analysed. Results were compared to those obtained with the same methods for frugivorous and nectarivorous bats.\n            One hundred and forty eight gleaning animalivores, 41 aerial insectivores and 28 bats belonging to other guilds (omnivore, sanguivore) were trapped during the whole study. Capture analyses showed that species richness and abundance sharply declined in islets and in the island 2 in 1995 and 1996. However no significant difference was found between islands and continuous forest in 1997. There was no difference either in species richness or in abundance between the island 2 and several islets of comparable isolation. On the contrary, indices were significantly lower in far islets situated at more than 1 50 m from the continuous forest than in near ones. One possible explanation is the reluctance of understorey species to cross open water to reach far islands.\n            Between 1994 and 1997, we failed to detect any difference in the relative proportion of aerial insectivores and gleaning animalivores between islands and the continuous forest. Among non-frugivorous species, gleaning animalivores represented 73 % of the total number of captures made in the two habitats. Similarly no habitat differences were found in the respective contributions of frugivores and animalivores to bat communities. Frugivores made up roughly 80 % of the total number of bats captured during the study. Within the gleaning animalivores guild, there was a positive relationship between abundance of a species in islands and its abundance in the control area. Moreover, a positive correlation was equally found between body size and abundance in all habitats.\n            The contribution of our results to the understanding of the impact of habitat fragmentation on animalivorous bats is limited due to rarity and low detectability of a high number of species making up animalivorous bat communities in Neotropical forests. Therefore, additional methods to collect and analyse data that take into account these features should be implemented to evaluate more accurately the impact of habitat fragmentation on bat communities at Saint-Eugène.\n          , \n            Les effets de la fragmentation de l’habitat sur la communauté des chauves-souris animalivores ont été étudiés dans les îlots forestiers formés en 1994 lors de la mise en eau du barrage de Petit Saut (Guyane française). Un protocole d’échantillonnage standardisé, incluant une zone de référence restée intacte tout au long de l’étude entre 1993 et 1997, a permis de suivre les modifications affectant la communauté des chauves-souris animalivores dans une île de 28 ha (île 2) bien isolée et dans 15 îlots d’une superficie inférieure à 6 ha plus ou moins isolés selon les cas. Les résultats obtenus ont été comparés avec ceux obtenus dans les mêmes conditions lors d’une précédente étude pour les chauves-souris frugivores et nectarivores.\n            148 chauves-souris animalivores glaneuses, 41 insectivores aériennes, 28 omnivores ou hématophages ont été capturées au cours de l’étude. L’analyse de ces captures montre que la richesse spécifique et l’abondance des individus ont chuté fortement en 1995 et 1996 dans l’île 2 et dans les îlots mais pas en 1997. Aucune différence de richesse ou d’abondance entre l’île 2 et les îlots de degré d’isolement comparable n’a été détectée. En revanche, les indices de richesse et d’abondance obtenus pour les îlots éloignés de plus de 150 m du bloc forestier sont significativement plus faibles que ceux obtenus pour les îlots situés à proximité immédiate de la forêt intacte. Il est suggéré que le survol d’une étendue d’eau fibre pourrait constituer une barrière au déplacement notamment pour les espèces animalivores glaneuses de sous-bois.\n            Entre 1994 et 1997, la proportion relative de chauves-souris aériennes insectivores et glaneuses animalivores dans les îlots forestiers et dans le bloc forestier n’était pas différente, les glaneuses animalivores représentant 73 % des captures dans les deux milieux. De même, il n’y a pas de différence dans la contribution respective des guildes animalivores et frugivores aux peuplements insulaire et du bloc forestier. Les chauves-souris frugivores représentent autour de 80 % des captures dans les deux habitats. A l’intérieur de la guilde des glaneuses animalivores, il existe une forte corrélation entre l’abondance d’une espèce en forêt non perturbée et son abondance dans l’île 2 et dans les îlots. Une corrélation positive entre la taille corporelle et l’abondance a également été trouvée tous milieux confondus.\n            La portée des résultats obtenus ici est limitée du fait de la rareté et de la faible piégeabilité d’un nombre élevé d’espèces qui composent le peuplement des chauves-souris animalivores en forêt néotropicale. D’autres techniques de collecte et d’analyse des données, qui tiennent compte de ces particularités, devront être mises en œuvre pour pleinement évaluer l’impact de la fragmentation de l’habitat sur les communautés de chauves-souris animalivores à Saint-Eugène.",

            "abstractNote": "Based on the results of winter monitoring of bats conducted in 2020–2022 in key wintering sites—limestone mines located within the continental part of the Back Sea area and the steppe area of Ukraine (Mykolayiv and Odesa oblasts)—we have recorded 7 species of bats: Myotis daubentonii, M. dasycneme, M. aurascens, M. mystacinus, Plecotus auritus, P. austriacus, and Eptesicus serotinus. Compared to results of monitoring conducted between 2008 and 2011, the number of bats that winter in the mentioned mines has doubled, from 702 to 1421 specimens. One individual of M. aurascens, which was ringed in the mine KVL-K in 2008–2011, was recorded there for the second time. The ring number is VТ 03492, Kyiv, Ukraine. Five species of bats were recorded in each of the three monitored sites. The results of the two monitoring sessions appear to be almost identical both by species composition and abundance. The dominating species in the inspected sites and, apparently, generally for winter aggregations of the same type in the region is M. daubentonii. The species share in the total sample was 77%. In Kovalivka (KVL-K) and Illyinka (ILN-K) mines, the co-dominance of two species—M. daubentonii and M. aurascens—was observed (23.3% and 26.8%, respectively). The species M. mystacinus was recorded only in the Kovalivsky mines (9.6%), whereas P. auritus was found only in the Nova Odesa mines (0.1%). The Nova Odesa mines play a key role in preserving the rare M. dasycneme in Ukraine harbouring the most abundant and widely known accumulation of this species. All investigated caves are particularly important for the preservation of bat populations in the region and their support during critical stages of their life. Granting the Kuyalnik Estuary the status of nature reserve will contribute to the conservation of habitats important for bats. Monitoring of key habitats for conservation of bat species is an important task for the implementation of EUROBATS agreement, which was signed by Ukraine. The obtained data are especially crucial considering the invasion of the russian federation to Ukraine since it is unclear when there will be a chance to continue the monitoring of bats in these key wintering sites and what is their current condition.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Bats are potential natural reservoirs for emerging viruses, causing deadly human diseases, such as COVID-19, MERS, SARS, Nipah, Hendra, and Ebola infections. The fundamental mechanisms by which bats are considered “living bioreactors” for emerging viruses are not fully understood. Some studies suggest that tolerance to viruses is linked to suppressing antiviral immune and inflammatory responses due to DNA damage by energy generated to fly. Our study reveals that bats' gut bacteria could also be involved in the host and its microbiota's DNA damage. We performed screening of lactic acid bacteria and bacilli isolated from bats' feces for mutagenic and oxidative activity by lux-biosensors. The pro-mutagenic activity was determined when expression of\n              recA\n              increased with the appearance of double-strand breaks in the cell DNA, while an increase of\n              katG\n              expression in the presence of hydroxyl radicals indicated antioxidant activity. We identified that most of the isolated bacteria have pro-mutagenic and antioxidant properties at the same time. This study reveals new insights into bat gut microbiota's potential involvement in antiviral response and opens new frontiers in preventing emerging diseases originating from bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Exotic wildlife can act as reservoirs of diseases that are endemic in the area or can be the source of new emerging diseases through interspecies transmission. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) highlights the importance of virus surveillance in wild animals. Here, we report the identification of a novel bat coronavirus through surveillance of coronaviruses in wildlife. Analyses of the RNA sequence from the ORF1b and S-gene regions indicated that the virus is a group 1 coronavirus. The virus was detected in fecal and respiratory samples from three bat species (Miniopterus spp.). In particular, 63% (12 of 19) of fecal samples from Miniopterus pusillus were positive for the virus. These findings suggest that this virus might be commonly circulating in M. pusillus in Hong Kong.",

In this note we report a new species of Peropteryx for Bolivia, P. leucoptera Peters, 1867, the white-winged doglike bat. Specimens of this species were previously identified as P. kappleri and P. macrotis. We also provide morphometric data for P. leucoptera from Bolivia and P. kappleri from elsewhere in Latin America. Peropteryx leucoptera occurs in two biomes in Pando and Beni departments: tropical and subtropical humid broadleaf forests, and grasslands, savannas and tropical and subtropical scrublands, respectively. With this addition, the number of bat species known to occur in Bolivia increases to 142. Key words: Bolivia, Emballonuridae, Pando and Beni departments, range extension.",

The degree of ﬁt between upper and lower cheek teeth has been used to refer specimens to species-level taxa, but statistical data on occlusal ﬁt in relation to taxonomic identity have been lacking. We used landmarks on upper and lower ﬁrst molars of 20 bat populations representing 16 species to assess the degree of occlusal ﬁt (1) between teeth from the same individual; (2) between teeth from different individuals belonging to the same populations; and (3) between teeth belonging to different populations. We found that the ﬁt of teeth belonging to different populations was signiﬁcantly worse than between those of the same population and that the degree of misﬁt increased linearly with time since common ancestry, albeit with substantial variance. We used our comparisons to assess the species-level diversity within Batodon, the smallest known placental mammal from the Cretaceous. Our data suggest, with caveats, that instead of belonging to a single species, the specimens assigned to Batodon represent at least two species as different as those belonging to different genera or families of living bats.",

The very few species that do not follow these rules can give insights into interesting differences. The recorded maximum lifespans of bats are exceptional - over 40 years, compared with the laboratory mouse of 4 years. We investigated the differences in the biochemical composition of mitochondria between bat and mouse species. We used proteomics and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry lipidomics, to interrogate mitochondrial fractions prepared from Mus musculus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus brain and skeletal muscle. Fatty acid binding protein 3 was found at different levels in mouse and bat muscle mitochondria and its orthologues were investigated in Caenorhabditis elegans knock-downs for LBP 4, 5 and 6. In the bat, high levels of free fatty acids and N-acylethanolamine lipid species together with a significantly greater abundance of fatty acid binding protein 3 in muscle (1.8-fold, p=0.037) were found. Manipulation of fatty acid binding protein orthologues in C. elegans suggest these proteins and their role in lipid regulation are important for mitochondrial function.",

Stereoscopic photographs were taken, both by reflected and by transmitted light, and measurements of best gliding angle were made. Variation of wing span and area at different speeds was much less than in birds. This is attributed to the construction of the wing, which prevents the bat from folding back the manus in flight, because this would lead to collapse of the plagiopatagium. The trailing edge of the wing is normally deflected upwards in flight, at least in the distal parts. This is interpreted as providing longitudinal stability. The plagiopatagialis proprii muscles appear to act as an elevator, by deflecting the trailing edge of the plagiopatagium upwards. The speed range over which the bat could glide was 5·3–11·0 m/s. Its maximum lift coefficient was 1-5, and its best glide ratio 6·8:1. The Reynolds number range, based on mean chord, was 3·26 × 104 to 6·79 × 104. A simple regression analysis of the glide polar indicated a very high span efficiency factor (k) and low wing profile drag coefficient (Cdp). On the other hand, a drag analysis on the assumption that k = 1 leads to an improbably large increase in the estimated Cdpat low speeds. It is suggested that the correct interpretation probably lies between these extremes, with k ≈ 1·5; Cdp would then be about 0·02 at high speeds, rising to somewhat over o-i at the minimum speed. It would appear that the bat is not so good as a pigeon at fast gliding, but better at low-speed manoeuvring. On most points of performance, however, the two are remarkably similar.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Prosimian lemurs differ fundamentally from anthropoid primates in many traits related to social structure. By exploring the demography of Milne‐Edwards' sifakas (\n              Propithecus diadema edwardsi\n              ), and comparing it to other well‐studied primates, we explore the effect of demographic and life‐history factors on social structure. Specifically, we compare lemur survivorship and fertility patterns to two published composite models: one created for New World and another created for Old World monkeys. Using longitudinal data collected on individual\n              Propithecus diadema edwardsi\n              from four study groups from 1986–2000 in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, we quantify 1) group composition, 2) birth seasonality, 3) interbirth interval, 4) life‐table values, and 5) population growth estimates. The mortality, survivorship, and life‐expectancy schedules indicate high infant and juvenile mortality. Fertility remains high until death. The intrinsic rate of increase and net reproductive rate indicate a shrinking population. We suggest that high mortality rather than low fertility causes the observed population decline. While sifaka survivorship closely resembles New World patterns, fertility resembles Old World patterns, i.e., like New World monkeys, few sifakas survive to reproductive age, and those that do, reproduce at a slow rate resembling the Old World pattern. This necessarily impacts social structure. An adult sifaka at the end of her lifespan will have one only daughter who survives to reproductive age, compared to 3.4 for New World or 2.7 for Old World monkeys. Demography limits the formation of large kin‐based groups for sifakas, and survivorship and fertility patterns do not easily permit sifakas to form large same‐sex family groups.

            "abstractNote": "The ﬂight membranes of bats are susceptible to damage (e.g., holes and tears) from a number of sources, including impacts with natural and man-made objects, ﬁghting between conspeciﬁcs, and attacks by predators or pathogens. Biologists routinely biopsy bat wings as a method of tissue collection for molecular research, and sometimes for the temporary identiﬁcation of animals in the ﬁeld. A previous study reported that captive big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) rapidly and completely healed ﬂight membrane wounds. Given that limited care is provided to animals following tissue biopsy in the ﬁeld, we sought to determine whether healing times for wounds from bats in captivity were applicable to bats in the wild. We measured and compared healing times of wounds in the wing and tail membranes of 50 non-reproductive female big brown bats from a wild population in Cuba following recapture. Tail wounds healed signiﬁcantly faster than wing wounds of the same size, likely because of the increased thickness and vasculature of the tail membrane. Our data are concordant with a previous laboratory study in captive big brown bats, and conﬁrm that tail membrane biopsies are better for obtaining tissue samples for molecular work because tail wounds heal faster than wing wounds.

We here provide a first account of the history, recent activities, current state, present assets, and possible future developments of these two natural history collections. A brief review of the Southeast Asian natural history museums and collections, including herbaria, highlights the scarcity and importance of natural repositories of biodiversity in this region, one of the world’s richest biodiversity hotspots.",

            "abstractNote": "Food habit of insectivorous bats was studied using fecal analysis. The fresh bat dropping samples from Mahendra cave, Pokhara and Nagarjun cave, Kathmandu were collected in March and September 2011. Bat droppings were moistened in hot water, separated into fine pieces and observed under stereoscope. The recovered insects and insect parts were mounted in slide, photographed and identified up to Order and Family level. Altogether ten insect orders viz. Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Homoptera, Odonata, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Trichoptera and Thysanoptera and 25 families were identified. In addition, spider and mites were also reported. The identification key to Order and Family level has been prepared based on the studied characters compared with taxonomic characters from literature.",

            "abstractNote": "Anthropogenic environmental change is often implicated in the emergence of new zoonoses from wildlife; however, there is little mechanistic understanding of these causal links. Here, we examine the transmission dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence; including urban habituation and decreased migration—two widely observed changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations, and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks in horses and people.",

            "abstractNote": "Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypoth...",

Poor understanding of HeV dynamics in Pteropus spp. (flying fox or fruit bat) reservoir hosts has limited our ability to determine factors driving its emergence. We initiated a longitudinal field study of HeV in little red flying foxes (LRFF; Pteropus scapulatus) and examined individual and population risk factors for infection, to determine probable modes of intraspecific transmission. We also investigated whether seasonal changes in host behaviour, physiology and demography affect host–pathogen dynamics. Data showed that pregnant and lactating females had significantly higher risk of infection, which may explain previously observed temporal associations between HeV outbreaks and flying fox birthing periods. Age-specific seroprevalence curves generated from field data imply that HeV is transmitted horizontally via faeces, urine or saliva. Rapidly declining seroprevalence between two field seasons suggests that immunity wanes faster in LRFF than in other flying fox species, and highlights the potentially critical role of this species in interspecific viral persistence. The highest seroprevalence was observed when animals showed evidence of nutritional stress, suggesting that environmental processes that alter flying fox food sources, such as habitat loss and climate change, may increase HeV infection and transmission. These insights into the ecology of HeV in flying fox populations suggest causal links between anthropogenic environmental change and HeV emergence.",

            "abstractNote": "The loss of biodiversity in the ecosystems has created the general conditions that have favored and, in fact, made possible, the insurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of factors have contributed to it: deforestation, changes in forest habitats, poorly regulated agricultural surfaces, mismanaged urban growth. They have altered the composition of wildlife communities, greatly increased the contacts of humans with wildlife, and altered niches that harbor pathogens, increasing their chances to come in contact with humans. Among the wildlife, bats have adapted easily to anthropized environments such as houses, barns, cultivated ﬁelds, orchards, where they found the suitable ecosystem to prosper. Bats are major hosts for aCoV and bCoV: evolution has shaped their peculiar physiology and their immune system in a way that makes them resistant to viral pathogens that would instead successfully attack other species, including humans. In time, the coronaviruses that bats host as reservoirs have undergone recombination and other modiﬁcations that have increased their ability for inter-species transmission: one modiﬁcation of particular importance has been the development of the ability to use ACE2 as a receptor in host cells. This particular development in CoVs has been responsible for the serious outbreaks in the last two decades, and for the present COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "abstractNote": "Tropical rainforests usually have multiple strata that results in a vertical stratification of ecological opportunities for animals. We investigated if this stratification influences the way bats use the vertical space in flooded and unflooded forests of the Central Amazon. Using mist-nets set in the canopy (17 to 35 m high) and in the understorey (0 to 3 m high) we sampled four sites in upland unflooded forests (terra firme), three in forests seasonally flooded by nutrient-rich water (várzea), and three in forests seasonally flooded by nutrient-poor water (igapó). Using rarefaction curves we found that species richness in the understorey and canopy were very similar. An ordination analysis clearly separated the bat assemblages of the canopy from those of the understorey in both flooded and unflooded habitats. Gleaning carnivores were clearly associated with the understorey, whereas frugivores were abundant in both strata. Of the frugivores, Carollinae and some Stenodermatinae were understorey specialists, but several Stenodermatinae mostly used the canopy. The first group mainly includes species that, in general, feed on fruits of understorey shrubs, whereas the second group feed on figs and other canopy fruits. We conclude that vertical stratification in bat communities occurs even within forests with lower canopy heights, such as Amazonian seasonally flooded forests, and that the vertical distribution of bat species is closely related to their diet and foraging behaviour [Current Zoology 56 (4): 469–478, 2010].",

            "abstractNote": "Vultures and condors (hereafter vultures) make up one the most threatened avian guilds in the world due to a variety of human-mediated impacts and disturbances. In fact, 70% of vulture species are currently suffering impacted by signiﬁcant conservation threats, with lead contamination being particularly important. Unfortunately, lead contamination in vulture species remains poorly studied in many regions of the world. We reviewed the existing scientiﬁc knowledge about this threat to vultures. We found 62 scientiﬁc articles studying lead contamination in vultures. Seventy-two percent of these articles were from North America and Europe, with the rest corresponding to Asia (13%), South America (8%), and Africa (7%). Most (92%) were published recently (2001–2018). Published articles included information on 13 vulture species out of a total of 23 from both the Old (9) and New World (4). Eighty-eight percent of the articles showed individuals with lead concentrations above threshold levels in some tissues sampled, with New World (Cathartidae) vultures more affected than Old World vultures (Accipitridae). The most suspected but rarely probed source of lead was lead ammunition, but other sources such as pollution or industry were also reported. It is concerning that lead contamination is considered a major threat for just 8% (2/23) of the vulture species categorized by the IUCN Red list. Our review shows that lead contamination is an important threat for several vulture species worldwide, but remains undiagnosed and not well-recognized in some species and geographical areas. The effect of this contaminant on vulture demography is not well known but merits particular attention since it may be leading to population declines in several species.",

            "abstractNote": "Identiﬁcation of retrotransposon insertions in nonmodel taxa can be technically challenging and costly. This has inhibited progress in understanding retrotransposon insertion dynamics outside of a few well-studied species. To address this problem, we have extended a retrotransposon-based capture and sequence method (ME-Scan [mobile element scanning]) to identify insertions belonging to the Ves family of short interspersed elements (SINEs) across seven species of the bat genus Myotis. We identiﬁed between 120,000 and 143,000 SINE insertions in six taxa lacking a draft genome by comparing to the M. lucifugus reference genome. On average, each Ves insertion was sequenced to 129.6 Â coverage. When mapped back to the M. lucifugus reference genome, all insertions were conﬁdently assigned within a 10-bp window. Polymorphic Ves insertions were identiﬁed in each taxon based on their mapped locations. Using cross-species comparisons and the identiﬁed insertion positions, a presence–absence matrix was created for approximately 796,000 insertions. Dollo parsimony analysis of more than 85,000 phylogenetically informative insertions recovered strongly supported, monophyletic clades that correspond with the biogeography of each taxa. This phylogeny is similar to previously published mitochondrial phylogenies, with the exception of the placement of M. vivesi. These results support the utility of our variation on ME-Scan to identify polymorphic retrotransposon insertions in taxa without a reference genome and for large-scale retrotransposon-based phylogenetics.",

Bats favor caves for the establishment of large populations thanks to favorable microclimatic conditions. Colombia has an important cave system in the Santander region that has not been fully explored, thus its importance for bat conservation remains largely unknown. Here we report the most updated list of the species present in the Macaregua Cave (Santander, Colombia) and comment on its use by different species. We found eight species that use the cave permanently or sporadically in addition to two previously known species. We also found a high population that ranges between 7,000–10,000 individuals. Macaregua Cave can now be recognized as the most bat-diverse (S = 10) cave in Colombia, harboring an important bat population of pest controllers and seed dispersers.",

First discovered in 1973, it was until recently only known from a small population of approximately 2,300 individuals restricted to the catchment area of the River Kwai, Thailand. However, in 2001 a single craseonycterid was discovered in Mon State, Myanmar, extending its geographical range by approximately 250 km. In October and November 2002 a survey was undertaken to examine the status of\n              C. thonglongyai\n              in Myanmar and assess its geographical distribution and population size.\n              C. thonglongyai\n              calls were recorded from bats emerging from nine of 19 caves surveyed; the population size was estimated to be 1,500. The phylogenetic relationships between the Thai and Myanmar populations were investigated using molecular, morphological and acoustic data. Morphologically, the two populations are indistinguishable. However, there is an 8–10 kHz echolocation call divergence between the populations.\n              Cytochrome b\n              data suggest that the two populations are similar and that the Myanmar population may be monophyletic. Annual surveys of the known bat roosts and\n              in situ\n              education programmes for local people are recommended together with the establishment of an integrated, transboundary Myanmar/Thai conservation strategy.",

We propose that these trigger events may enhance transmission of Ebola virus from its cryptic reservoir to humans. These findings suggest specific directions to help understand the sylvatic cycle of the virus and may provide early warning tools to detect possible future outbreaks of this enigmatic disease.",

Proﬁles of genomic diversity and divergence indicate that Hawaiian hoary bats are distinct from northern hoary bats, and form a monophyletic group, indicating a single ancestral colonization event 1.34 Ma, followed by substantial divergence between islands beginning 0.51 Ma. Phylogenetic analysis indicates Maui is central to the radiation across the archipelago, with the southward expansion to Hawai‘i and westward to O‘ahu and Kaua‘i. Because this endangered species is of conservation concern, a clearer understanding of the population genetic structure of this bat in the Hawaiian Islands is of timely importance.",

Today there is an urgent need to address the human-bat conﬂict to develop conservation policies. Understanding peoples’ attitudes towards bats are critical for this process. This study aimed to design the Bats Attitudes Standard Scale (BAtSS) and to analyze its psychometric properties. We developed an initial version of the scale in which we established the content validity; we analyzed the items and structure in a pilot sample. In the next phase, we examined psychometric properties in a sample of 1639 Chileans. The ﬁnal BAtSS consists of 34 Likert-type items conﬁgured in an oblique-hierarchical structure of four factors (scientistic, positivistic, negativistic, and myths) and three facets (emotional negativistic, behavioral negativistic, and cognitive negativistic). It presents adequate internal consistency, and the analysis of concurrent validity conﬁrms the scale’s capacity to discriminate between groups. Women and participants with a lower level of education are more negativistic and less positivistic. People with a higher level of education have a less mythological view of bats. We also analyzed the items under the assumptions of item response theory (IRT).",

However, for behavioral and ecological studies, these methods are not useful when the aim is to selectively capture focal groups or individual bats. Although some tools have been proposed for this, they have limitations with respect to their weight and the logistics of their use. We present the design of a new device called a \"cone trap\" that allows targeted captures of speci c groups (harems, groups of males and females, nurseries and solitary individuals) of bats in caves.",

We sampled in three tropical montane cloudforest fragments and in three coffeeplantations with traditionalpolyculture shade between 1998 and 2001. The three indicatorgroups responded differently to the transformation oftropical montane cloudforest into shaded coffee plantations. The species richness offrogs was one-fifth less in coffee plantations than in forestfragments, and only one-third ofthefrog species occurred in bothforestfragments and coffeeplantations. The number ofbeetle species and their abundance was significantlygreater in coffeeplantations than in theforestfragments, whereas species richness and species composition of bats were virtually the same in both habitats. The majority of the abundant species remained as such in both communities, but species that were less abundant were not scarce in both habitats. We attributed differences in the species assemblages to the differing degrees ofpenetrability of the borders of the two habitat types (especially for the coffee plantations) and to the differences in life-history traits among species. Shaded coffee plantationsform a matrix that envelops the remainingfragments ofcloud forest. Together they connect theforestfragments with the other habitats ofthe landscape and represent a highly functional resourcefor the preservation of biodiversity that serves as a complement to but not a substitutefor cloudforest in this notably modified landscape.",

            "abstractNote": "Marburg virus disease (MVD) describes a viral haemorrhagic fever responsible for a number of outbreaks across eastern and southern Africa. It is a zoonotic disease, with the Egyptian rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) identified as a reservoir host. Infection is suspected to result from contact between this reservoir and human populations, with occasional secondary human-to-human transmission.Index cases of previous human outbreaks were identified and reports of infection in animals recorded. These data were modelled within a species distribution modelling framework in order to generate a probabilistic surface of zoonotic transmission potential of MVD across sub-Saharan Africa.Areas suitable for zoonotic transmission of MVD are predicted in 27 countries inhabited by 105 million people. Regions are suggested for exploratory surveys to better characterise the geographical distribution of the disease, as well as for directing efforts to communicate the risk of practices enhancing zoonotic contact.These maps can inform future contingency and preparedness strategies for MVD control, especially where secondary transmission is a risk. Coupling this risk map with patient travel histories could be used to guide the differential diagnosis of highly transmissible pathogens, enabling more rapid response to outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever.",

            "abstractNote": "As the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa is now contained, attention is turning from control to future outbreak prediction and prevention. Building on a previously published zoonotic niche map (Pigott et al., 2014), this study incorporates new human and animal occurrence data and expands upon the way in which potential bat EVD reservoir species are incorporated. This update demonstrates the potential for incorporating and updating data used to generate the predicted suitability map. A new data portal for sharing such maps is discussed. This output represents the most up-to-date estimate of the extent of EVD zoonotic risk in Africa. These maps can assist in strengthening surveillance and response capacity to contain viral haemorrhagic fevers.",
