As wild pangolin populations decline, there is a need to improve the ability to maintain healthy populations in captivity. This chapter presents veterinary health information obtained from the literature and rescue and rehabilitation centers, conservation breeding programs and zoos housing pangolins worldwide. It presents reference ranges for respiratory rate, heart rate, core body temperature, blood biochemistry and hematology, and a comprehensive formulary of therapeutic agents used to treat pangolins. It also discusses bacterial, protozoan, viral and parasitic organisms known for pangolins, but there is little knowledge of the health impact of infection with these organisms. Non-infectious diseases commonly seen in captive pangolins include respiratory disease, trauma and gastrointestinal ulceration. There remain significant gaps in knowledge of pangolin health, with little, if any, information on the Philippine, black-bellied and giant pangolins.",

Lactobacillus gorillae-previously isolated from the wild and captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla)-were successfully isolated from wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in addition to other captive and wild western lowland gorillas. The strains from wild gorillas could ferment D-xylose, arbutine, cellobiose, and trehalose better than those from captive gorillas. By contrast, tolerance to NaCl was higher in isolates from captive gorillas than in those from wild gorillas. This tendency may have been induced by regular foods in zoos, which contain sufficient amount of salts but less amount of indigestible fiber and plant secondary metabolites compared to foods in the wild. All strains of L. gorillae showed inhibitory activities to enteric pathogenic bacteria; however, the activity was significantly higher for strains from wild gorillas than for those from captive gorillas. This may have been induced by the captive condition with routine veterinary intervention. Since L. gorillae can grow in the gastrointestinal tract of gorillas in captivity, the strains from wild mountain gorillas are potential probiotics for gorillas under captive conditions.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: The 2014-15 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic strained health systems in west Africa already overburdened with other diseases, including malaria. Because EVD and malaria can be difficult to distinguish clinically, and rapid testing was not available in many Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), guidelines recommended empirical malaria treatment. Little is known, however, about the prevalence and characteristics of patients entering an ETU who were infected with malaria parasites, either alone or concurrently with Ebola virus. METHODS: Data for sociodemographics, disease characteristics, and mortality were analysed for patients with suspected EVD admitted to three ETUs in Sierra Leone using a retrospective cohort design. Testing for Ebola virus was done by real-time PCR and for malaria by a rapid diagnostic test. Characteristics of patients were compared and survival analyses were done to evaluate the effect of infection status on mortality. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2014, and Oct 15, 2015, 1524 cases were treated at the three ETUs for suspected EVD, of whom 1368 (90%) had diagnostic data for malaria and EVD. Median age of patients was 29 years (IQR 20-44) and 715 (52%) were men. 1114 patients were EVD negative, of whom 365 (33%) tested positive for malaria. Of 254 EVD positive patients, 53 (21%) also tested positive for malaria. Mortality risk was highest in patients diagnosed with both EVD and malaria (35 [66%] of 53 died) and patients diagnosed with EVD alone (105 [52%] of 201 died). Compared with patients presenting to ETUs without malaria or EVD, mortality was increased in the malaria positive and EVD positive group (adjusted hazard ratio 9.36, 95% CI 6.18-14.18, p<0.0001), and the malaria negative and EVD positive group (5.97, 4.44-8.02, p<0.0001), but reduced in the malaria positive and EVD negative group (0.37, 0.20-1.23, p=0.0010). INTERPRETATION: Malaria parasite co-infection was common in patients presenting to ETUs and conferred an increased mortality risk in patients infected with Ebola virus, supporting empirical malaria treatment in ETUs. The high mortality among patients without EVD or malaria suggests expanded testing and treatment might improve care in future EVD epidemics. FUNDING: International Medical Corps.",

To top it all, the profound role of climate change on many ecological processes has affected the inability of many species to adapt to these relatively rapid changes. This special issue, \"Zoonotic Disease Ecology: Effects on Humans, Domestic Animals and Wildlife,\" explores the complex interactions of emerging infectious diseases across taxa linked to many of these anthropogenic and environmental drivers. Selected emerging zoonoses including RNA viruses, Rift Valley fever, trypanosomiasis, Hanta virus infection, and other vector-borne diseases are discussed in detail. Also, coprophagous beetles are proposed as important vectors in the transmission and maintenance of infectious pathogens. An overview of the impacts of climate change in emerging disease ecology within the context of Brazil as a case study is provided. Animal Care and Use Committee requirements were investigated, concluding that ecology journals have low rates of explicit statements regarding the welfare and wellbing of wildlife during experimental studies. Most of the solutions to protect biodiversity and predicting and preventing the next epidemic in humans originating from wildlife are oriented towards the developed world and are less useful for biodiverse, low-income economies. We need the development of regional policies to address these issues at the local level.",

The most consistent abnormalities are seen in cell-mediated immunity, complement system, phagocyte function, cytokine production, mucosal secretory antibody response, and antibody affinity. There is a number of physiological situations such as ageing and performance of intense physical exercise associated with an impairment of some immune parameters' response. Nutrition can influence the extent of immune alteration in both of them. There are also numerous pathological situations in which nutrition plays a role as a primary or secondary determinant of some underlying immunological impairments. This includes obesity, eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa), food hypersensitivity and gastrointestinal disorders as some examples. The implications of nutrition on immune function in these disorders are briefly reviewed.",

We hypothesized that hypothalamic expression of leptin receptor mRNA would decrease during the premigration (PM) period in the little brown myotis, Myotis lucifugus. Body mass of M. lucifugus increased during the PM period, but serum leptin levels did not change during that time. Hypothalamic mRNA levels for both the short (ObRa) and fully active long (ObRb) forms of the leptin receptor increased during PM, but the relative increase in ObRa was larger and occurred sooner than ObRb. mRNA levels of an inhibitor of leptin signaling (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3: PIAS3) increased in hypothalami during the PM period in bats. Adiponectin is an adipokine that has been linked to obesity in rodents; normally, serum levels of adiponectin decrease in obesity. In M. lucifugus, adiponectin mRNA levels decreased in adipose tissue during the period of mass gain, but circulating adiponectin levels did not change. We conclude that the relative changes in leptin receptor isoform expression during the PM fattening period may favor binding of leptin to the less active short isoform. Coupled with increased expression of PIAS3 and the dissociation of serum leptin levels from body mass and adiposity, these changes could account in part for the adaptive fattening during the PM period. In addition, the adipokine profiles of M. lucifugus during the PM period and that of obesity in non-hibernating mammals are strikingly dissimilar.",

In this study, we present the first wake structure analysis for an insectivorous bat. Tadarida brasiliensis, the Brazilian free-tailed bat, is an aerial hunter that annually migrates long distances and also differs strikingly from the previously investigated species morphologically. We compare the aerodynamics of T. brasiliensis with those of other, frugivorous bats and with common swifts, Apus apus, a bird with wing morphology, kinematics and flight ecology similar to that of these bats. The comparison reveals that, for the range of speeds evaluated, the cyclical pattern of aerodynamic forces associated with a wingbeat shows more similarities between T. brasiliensis and A. apus than between T. brasiliensis and other frugivorous bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Baseline and stress-responsive glucocorticoid (GC) levels were characterized during the active period in free-ranging male and reproductive female little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus). Bats were trapped and blood was sampled within 3min of capture at two maternity sites during the summer and at one swarming site prior to hibernation in New England. Both GC hormones, cortisol and corticosterone, were detected, with cortisol accounting for an average of ~95% of total circulating GCs. Samples collected at the dusk emergence and after the first return from feeding showed significant seasonal differences across the active period (early pregnancy, mid-to-late pregnancy, lactation [and comparable mid-summer times for males], and pre-hibernation) within and between each sex. Elevated baseline values were found in mid-to-late pregnancy females at emergence, and in both males and females at the swarming site compared to other groups. Female GC values during mid-to-late pregnancy and during the pre-hibernation period were greater than those for males. Significantly higher GC levels following 15min of restraint were exhibited by all animals in the summer and prior to hibernation. There was little variation between groups or sexes in the total GC levels reached following restraint. Taken together, these results suggest that: (1) GCs may be involved in the increased feeding and/or fat deposition characteristic of pregnancy and the pre-hibernation period, (2) GCs may be related to mating and to the generally increased levels of activity that occur during the pre-hibernation period, and (3) regardless of sex or reproductive condition, all animals maximally respond to restraint stress. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This orchestrates a complex behavioral and autonomic repertoire in response to environmental temperature challenges or declining energy homeostasis and in support of immune responses and many behavioral states. This review summarizes the anatomical, neurotransmitter, and functional relationships within the central neural network that controls the principal thermoeffectors: cutaneous vasoconstriction regulating heat loss and shivering and brown adipose tissue for heat production. The core thermoregulatory network regulating these thermoeffectors consists of parallel but distinct central efferent pathways that share a common peripheral thermal sensory input. Delineating the neural circuit mechanism underlying central thermoregulation provides a useful platform for exploring its functional organization, elucidating the molecular underpinnings of its neuronal interactions, and discovering novel therapeutic approaches to modulating body temperature and energy homeostasis.",

            "abstractNote": "The microsites that animals occupy during the rest phase of their circadian activity cycle influence their physiology and behaviour, but relatively few studies have examined correlations between interspecific variation in thermal physiology and roost microclimate. Among bats, there is some evidence that species exposed to high roost temperatures (Troost) possess greater heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity, but the small number of species for which both thermal physiology and roost microclimate data exist mean that the generality of this pattern remains unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that bat heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity have co-evolved with roost preferences. We predicted that species occupying roosts poorly buffered from high outside environmental temperature exhibit higher heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity compared to species inhabiting buffered roosts in which Troost remains well below outside conditions. We used flow-through respirometry to investigate thermoregulation at air temperatures (Ta) approaching and exceeding normothermic body temperature (Tb) among six species with broadly similar body mass but differing in roost microclimate (hot vs. cool roosts). We combined these data with empirical measurements of Troost for each study population. Hot-roosting species tolerated Ta 4°C higher than cool-roosting bats before the onset of loss of coordinated locomotion and non-regulated hyperthermia. The evaporative scope (i.e. ratio of maximum evaporative water loss [EWL] to minimum thermoneutral EWL) of hot-roosting species (16.1 ± 2.4) was substantially higher than that of cool-roosting species (5.9 ± 2.4). Maximum evaporative cooling capacities (i.e. evaporative heat loss/metabolic heat production) of hot-roosting species were >2, while the corresponding values for cool-roosting species were ≤1. The greater heat tolerance and higher evaporative cooling capacity of hot-roosting species compared with those occupying cooler roosts reveal variation in bat evaporative cooling capacity correlated with roost microclimate, supporting the hypothesis that thermal physiology has co-evolved with roost preference.
