            "abstractNote": "Background  Habitat structure strongly influences niche differentiation, facilitates predator avoidance, and drives species-specific foraging strategies of bats. Vegetation structure is also a strong driver of echolocation call characteristics. The fine-scale assessment of how bats utilise such structures in their natural habitat is instrumental in understanding how habitat composition shapes flight- and acoustic behaviour. However, it is notoriously difficult to study their species-habitat relationship in situ.\nMethods  Here, we describe a methodology combining Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to characterise threedimensional vegetation structure and acoustic tracking to map bat behaviour. This makes it possible to study finescale use of habitat by bats, which is essential to understand spatial niche segregation in bats. Bats were acoustically tracked with microphone arrays and bat calls were classified to bat guild using automated identification. We did this in multiple LiDAR scanned vegetation plots in forest edge habitat. The datasets were spatially aligned to calculate the distance between bats’ positions and vegetation structures.\nResults  Our results are a proof of concept of combining LiDAR with acoustic tracking. Although it entails challenges with combining mass-volumes of fine-scale bat movements and vegetation information, we show the feasibility and potential of combining those two methods through two case studies. The first one shows stereotyped flight patterns of pipistrelles around tree trunks, while the second one presents the distance that bats keep to the vegetation in the presence of artificial light.\nConclusion  By combining bat guild specific spatial behaviour with precise information on vegetation structure, the bat guild specific response to habitat characteristics can be studied in great detail. This opens up the possibility to address yet unanswered questions on bat behaviour, such as niche segregation or response to abiotic factors in interaction with natural vegetation. This combination of techniques can also pave the way for other applications linking movement patterns of other vocalizing animals and 3D space reconstruction.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Millions of flying migrants encounter the Great Lakes and other large water bodies on long-distance flights each spring and fall, but quantitative data regarding how they traverse these obstacles are limited. Shorelines are known areas of migrant concentration due to the ecological barrier effect, but details on the magnitude of this concentration and the flight behaviors causing it are largely unknown and difficult to quantify. Mobile avian radar can provide a unique view of how birds and bats move across landscapes by tracking thousands of individual migrants moving through a sample volume that extends multiple kilometers in radius.\nResults: During the spring of 2014 we used two avian radar units to compare migration patterns at shoreline (1.5 km from the shore) and inland (20 km from the shore) sites along the eastern shoreline of Lake Michigan in the north-central US. We found shoreline activity to be 27% greater than inland activity over all time periods, and 132% greater during the hour surrounding dawn. An analysis of flight directions found that migrants flew to the north and northwest during dusk and night, with many heading out over the lake, but shifted direction towards the east at dawn, as those flying over water reoriented towards land. This shift in direction, which was most intense at the shoreline, may contribute to the higher concentrations of migrants observed at shorelines in this study and others.\nConclusions: These findings help confirm and quantify the phenomenon of nocturnal migrant reorientation at dawn, and also stress the functional importance of coastal regions for aerial migrants. The high use of coasts by migrants highlights the importance of conserving shoreline stopover habitat, which often competes with anthropogenic uses. We suggest using a high degree of caution when assessing potential impacts from development in these sensitive environments, and encourage protection of these high-use areas.",

Much research has addressed the impact of degradation on species diversity; however, little is known about how ecological interactions are altered, including those that constitute important ecosystem functions such as consumption of herbivores. To examine how rainforest degradation alters trophic interaction networks, we applied DNA metabarcoding to construct interaction networks linking forest-­dwelling insectivorous bat species and their prey, comparing old-­growth forest and forest degraded by logging in Sabah, Borneo. Individual bats in logged rainforest consumed a lower richness of prey than those in old-­growth forest. As a result, interaction networks in logged forests had a less nested structure. These network structures were associated with reduced network redundancy and thus increased vulnerability to perturbations in logged forests. Our results show how ecological interactions change between old-­growth and logged forests, with potentially negative implications for ecosystem function and network stability.",

            "abstractNote": "The increased accessibility of soft-tissue data through diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) enables comparative biologists to increase the taxonomic breadth of their studies with museum specimens. However, it is still unclear how soft-tissue measurements from preserved specimens reflect values from freshly collected specimens and whether diceCT preparation may affect these measurements. Here, we document and evaluate the accuracy of diceCT in museum specimens based on the soft-tissue reconstructions of brains and eyes of five bats. Based on proxies, both brains and eyes were roughly 60% of the estimated original sizes when first imaged. However, these structures did not further shrink significantly over a 4-week staining interval, and 1 week in 2.5% iodinebased solution yielded sufficient contrast for differentiating among soft-tissues. Compared to six “fresh” bat specimens imaged shortly after field collection (not fixed in ethanol), the museum specimens had significantly lower relative volumes of the eyes and brains. Variation in field preparation techniques and conditions, and long-term storage in ethanol may be the primary causes of shrinkage in museum specimens rather than diceCT staining methodology. Identifying reliable tissue-specific correction factors to adjust for the shrinkage now documented in museum specimens requires future work with larger samples.",

            "abstractNote": "Most species of birds of paradise (Paradisaeidae) are endemic in the rainforests of New Guinea. There are also a few species in the northern Moluccas and in northern Australia. Bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchidae) are centred in New Guinea but are more widespread in Australia. The two families have often been regarded as sister groups, but in recent studies Paradisaeidae appear as sister to Corvidae, a worldwide family which is notably depauperate in New Guinea and Australia. This indicates vicariance of a worldwide ancestor, rather than invasion of New Guinea. Other families in the superfamily Corvoidea include Ptilonorhynchidae (basal), Campephagidae (Africa to New Guinea and Fiji), and Cracticidae (Australia to New Guinea). Biodiversity levels in Paradisaeidae and Ptilonorhynchidae were assessed from literature records by counting numbers of species in grid cells 18 latitude by 18 longitude. Birds of paradise are equally diverse in the Mendi square and the Mount Hagen±Wahgi Valley±Jimi Valley square. Bowerbirds are most diverse in the Mount Hagen±Wahgi Valley±Jimi Valley square. This area lies on one of the main tectonic boundaries in New Guinea, the former margin of the Australian craton, and is geologically distinctive in having several diverse accreted terranes juxtaposed there, including an ophiolite complex. It also includes the western slopes of Mount Wilhelm, one of the highest mountains in the New Guinea orogen. Paradisaeidae have secondary centres of diversity in the southern part of the New Guinea orogen (south of the former craton margin), while Ptilonorhynchidae have secondary centres north of the craton margin on the accreted terranes, and also in eastern Australia. Within New Guinea the two distributions correlate closely with the geological interpretation of the orogen as comprising southern (craton) and northern (accreted terrane) components. Within Australia, Paradisaeidae have two species per degree square in northern Cape York Peninsula (on the old Australian craton), and only one elsewhere in eastern Australia, whereas Ptilonorhynchidae have a clear Australian massing further south in Queensland, on the accreted terranes of the Tasman orogen.",

Paired plasma and serum samples were centrifuged at 1 hr and 6 hr postcollection. Heparinization and time of centrifugation did not signiﬁcantly affect albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides, amylase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransaminase, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, sodium, and total carbon dioxide levels. Plasma was associated with higher globulin and lower potassium values. Glucose and chloride levels decreased signiﬁcantly over time, whereas phosphorus levels increased. Serum creatine kinase activity at 6 hr postcollection was signiﬁcantly higher than the other creatine kinase means. Sodium levels were not signiﬁcantly affected by sodium heparin as used as an anticoagulant in this study.",

The bats had been recently shipped and died shortly after release from a 30-day quarantine. One presented with clinical signs of anorexia and lethargy before death; the other died without prior clinical symptoms. The same Pasteurella-like organism was recovered antemortem from subcutaneous abscesses in two captive little golden mantled ﬂying foxes (Pteropus pumilus) housed with additional E. wahlbergi. The organism was also cultured on tracheal wash from one Malaysian ﬂying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) and another E. wahlbergi, both demonstrating clinical signs of pneumonia. All recovered isolates appeared morphologically and biochemically similar to the initial isolates and were further characterized as either a Pasteurella or Actinobacillus organism on the basis of biochemical and cellular fatty acid proﬁles. Screening of the current collection using pharyngeal swabs isolated this organism from 12 of 15 E. wahlbergi, two of three P. vampyrus, one of 26 island ﬂying foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus), and one of nine Rodrigues fruit bats (Pteropus rodricensis). The organism was not identiﬁed in pharyngeal culture from eight Indian ﬂying foxes (Pteropus giganteus), nine Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegypticus), or an additional 16 P. pumilus.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and increasing evidence supports the notion that bats can also harbor group A rotaviruses (RVAs), important causative agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 8 RVA strains possessing completely novel genotype constellations or genotypes possibly originating from other mammals have been identiﬁed from African and Chinese bats. However, all the data were mainly based on detection of RVA RNA, present only during acute infections, which does not permit assessment of the true exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically investigate the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or gut samples along with 448 bat sera were collected from ﬁve South Chinese provinces. Speciﬁc reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening found four RVA strains. Strain GLRL1 possessed a completely novel genotype constellation, whereas the other three possessed a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly characterized group of viruses widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence of crossspecies transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, whereas strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were likely reassortants between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-speciﬁc antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by an indirect immunoﬂuorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had a higher RVA-speciﬁc antibody prevalence than those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for cross-species transmission of MSLH14-like bat RVAs to humans, highlighting the impact of bats as reservoirs of RVAs on public health.",

            "abstractNote": "Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines produced by host cells in response to the infection with pathogens. By binding to the corresponding receptors, IFNs trigger different pathways to block intracellular replication and growth of pathogens and to impede the infection of surrounding cells. Due to their key role in host defense against viral infections, as well as for clinical therapies, the IFN responses and regulation mechanisms are well studied. However, studies of type I IFNs have mainly focused on alpha interferon (IFN-␣) and IFN-␤ subtypes. Knowledge of IFN-␬ and IFN-␻ is limited. Moreover, most studies are performed in humans or mouse models but not in the original host of zoonotic pathogens. Bats are important reservoirs and transmitters of zoonotic viruses such as lyssaviruses. A few studies have shown an antiviral activity of IFNs in fruit bats. However, the function of type I IFNs against lyssaviruses in bats has not been studied yet. Here, IFN-␬ and IFN-␻ genes from the European serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, were cloned and functionally characterized. E. serotinus IFN-␬ and IFN-␻ genes are intronless and well conserved between microchiropteran species. The promoter regions of both genes contain essential regulatory elements for transcription factors. In vitro studies indicated a strong activation of IFN signaling by recombinant IFN-␻, whereas IFN-␬ displayed weaker activation. Noticeably, both IFNs inhibit to different extents the replication of different lyssaviruses in susceptible bat cell lines. The present study provides functional data on the innate host defense against lyssaviruses in endangered European bats.",

An approach based on viral metagenomics was used to study gut specimens from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Full genomic sequencing analyses showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is akin to human and animal rotaviruses believed to be of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a range of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infection showed that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when they were inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5 × 10\n              2\n              50% tissue culture infective doses. As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably juvenile animals, will be crucial in determining whether or not this virus is widely distributed in the bat population.",

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT. Flying foxes are important in the maintenance of forests and diversity. However, knowledge of their behavioral ecology, especially of movement and foraging patterns, which are essential for conservation and management of their populations, are not well known. Therefore, movement behavior of two individuals of Pteropus vampyrus were examined using an Argos telemetry system, and foraging pattern of Pteropus spp. was directly observed, at West Java province, Indonesia in October 2017. The maximum distance between the location at which bats were released and their furthest roost, recorded via satellite telemetry, was approximately 100 km. This reflects the long-distance flight ability of P. vampyrus. Daytime roosting sites and nighttime foraging places consisted of several types of habitats, such as intact forests, agricultural lands, and residential areas. This evidence indicated that there was habitat overlap between humans and bats in West Java province. According to direct observation of the behaviors of flying foxes at two locations within residential areas, various activities such as wing spreading, excretion, fighting, aggressive calls, movement, hanging relax, and hanging alert were found. The number of bat-visits to the trees varied among night hours, and had a positive correlation with the number of fruit dropping. The data obtained in this study have improved our understanding of nighttime behavior and habitat utilization of P. vampyrus, that can be used to support landscape management, species conservation, and disease prevention in regions of Southeast Asia.",

            "abstractNote": "In the tropics, limestone caves in karstic areas are known for their unique biodiversity. However, many caves remain unstudied and little is known about underlying gradients that determine diversity and biomass in aquatic microhabitats. Here, we sampled zooplankton and benthos in a set of 12 aquatic caves, locally called closed cenotes in Yucatán, Mexico. Our aim was to explain diversity patterns and differences in biomass with particular attention for correlations between bat colony characteristics and other biota. Compared with caves that support photosynthesis, diversity was low with an average of four planktonic and two benthic species in these dark caves. Undetectable phosphorus concentrations in the water suggest this nutrient is limiting. Several associations hint at a potential link between bat abundance and functional guild composition, water quality and aquatic biota. As such, more bats were linked to higher nitrate concentrations. Yet this was not translated to higher invertebrate biomass, probably since phosphorus is limiting. Overall, the trends found in this survey suggest that bats could be important as fertilizers of the caves although mechanistic links that mediate the flux of nutrients need to be confirmed experimentally.",

However, they show distinct differences with respect to wing morphology and the echolocation behaviour of their component species. In the Palaeotropics, most bat families are clearly separated in wing morphospace. The morphological niche of Rhinolophidae is vacant in the Neotropics, but primitive echolocators using sound primarily for scanning the environment rather than for prey capture are much more frequent there than in the Palaeotropics. In our opinion, a large portion of this difference can be traced to the different evolutionary histories of the respective communities. Bat families of different geographical origin are involved and their foraging styles obviously evolved differently in the Old and New World.",

            "abstractNote": "In mammals, chicken-type (c-type) lysozymes are part of the innate immune system, killing bacteria by degrading peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Many of the studies on the evolution of c-type lysozymes have focused on its new digestive function, including the duplicated stomach lysozymes in ruminants. Similarly, in bats, gene duplications and subsequent adaptive evolution of c-type lysozyme have been reported in a clade of insectivorous species, which might have been driven by the need to digest chitin. However, no studies on the evolution of c-type lysozyme have been carried out in the second largest and dietary diverse bat family Phyllostomidae, which includes insectivorous, frugivorous, nectarivorous and sanguivorous species. Here, we sequenced and analyzed c-type lysozyme genes from four phyllostomid bats, the common vampire bat, the white-winged vampire bat, the lesser long-nosed bat and the big fruit-eating bat. Only a single lysozyme gene was identified in each of these species. Evidence for positive selection on mature lysozyme was found on lineages leading to vampire bats, but not other bats with single copy lysozyme genes. Moreover, several amino acid substitutions found in mature lysozymes from the sanguivorous clade are predicted to have functional impacts, adding further evidence for the adaptive evolution of lysozyme in vampire bats. Functional adaptation of vampire bat lysozymes could be associated with anti-microbial defense, possibly driven by the specialized sanguivory-related habits of vampire bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            In fragmented areas, the persistence of different species depends on their ability to use the surrounding matrix either as a corridor or as a foraging habitat. We assessed how species richness and abundance of Neotropical bats differ among forest fragments and rubber plantations under different management regimes. Our study site was located in a heterogeneous agricultural area in the Atlantic Forest of Bahia, northeastern Brazil. By combining mist netting and acoustic monitoring as complementary techniques, we caught 28 phyllostomid species and recorded 21 aerial insectivorous species, which either forage in open space or close to forests. Open space species were equally abundant and diverse in all land use types. In contrast, assemblages of phyllostomid and aerial insectivorous forest species differed significantly among habitats, with the highest species richness recorded in forest fragments. We identified a number of forest specialists in forest fragments, which indicates a relatively intact bat fauna. In intensively used rubber-cacao plantation, we found surprisingly high bat abundance and diversity, despite the shortage of resources for bats. Our results also indicate that patches of secondary vegetation around rubber plantations are important landscape features for bats and might contribute to the persistence of highly diverse bat assemblages. We suggest that bats do not perceive plantations as a hostile matrix, but probably use them as corridors between forest fragments and patches of secondary vegetation.\n            Em áreas fragmentadas, a persistência de diferentes espécies depende da habilidade delas em usar a matriz ao redor como um corredor ou hábitat de forrageio. Nós avaliamos como a riqueza de espécies e abundância de morcegos neotropicais diferem entre fragmentos de mata e seringais sob diferentes regimes de manejo. Nossa área de estudo estava localizada em uma área agrícola heterogênea na Mata Atlântica da Bahia, nordeste do Brasil. Combinando capturas em redes com monitoramento acústico como técnicas complementares, capturamos 28 espécies de morcegos filostomídeos e 21 espécies de morcegos insetívoros aéreos, que forrageiam em espaço aberto ou perto de florestas. As espécies de espaço aberto foram igualmente abundantes e diversas em todas as categorias de uso da terra. Por outro lado, comunidades de filostomídeos e insetívoros aéreos de florestas diferiram significativamente entre hábitats, com a maior riqueza de espécies tendo sido registrada em fragmentos de mata. Identificamos muitos especialistas em florestas nos fragmentos de mata, o que sugere que a fauna de morcegos ainda está relativamente intacta. Em plantações mistas de cacau e seringais intensivamente usadas, encontramos uma abundância e riqueza de morcegos surpreendentemente altas, apesar da escassez de recursos para morcegos. Nossos resultados indicam que manchas de vegetação secundária ao redor de seringais são importantes elementos da paisagem para morcegos e podem contribuir para a persistência de comunidades altamente diversas. Sugerimos que morcegos não percebem as plantações como uma matriz hostil, mas provavelmente as usam como corredores entre fragmentos de mata e manchas de vegetação secundária.",

            "abstractNote": "This paper introduces some theoretical concepts based on optimality theory that may be applied to bat migration. Most predictions are based on flight mechanics and potential flight range. Optimal behavior will depend on the relevant immediate currency, such as safety, time, or energy. Predictions concern optimal flight speeds, stopover duration, fuel load at departure, and the adaptive use of winds. I also consider a criterion for fuel management when bats are migrating between summer and hibernation sites. The overall migration speed is predicted to be 46 km/day for a small (10-g) bat, and banding recoveries in Nathusius’s bat (Pipistrellus nathusii) showed a mean speed of 47 km/day. The timing of migration in bats that minimizes the time spent in migration is considered a result of the trade-off between seasonally increased length of the night (decreased in spring) and reduction of aerial insect abundance. Most predictions remains to be tested; the theoretical framework herein offers a point of departure when designing new field or laboratory studies of bat migration.",

From late May to mid-August 2003–2006, we used radiotelemetry to investigate roost-site selection by Seminole bats (Lasiurus seminolus) on an intensively managed landscape with forested corridors in southern South Carolina. We tracked 27 (10 males and 17 females) adult Seminole bats to 90 (41 males and 49 females) diurnal roosts. We found 61% (n ¼ 25) of male and 63% (n ¼ 31) of female roosts in forested corridors, which comprised 11% of the landscape. We modeled roost-site selection with logistic regression and used Akaike’s information criterion for small samples (AICc) and Akaike weights to select models relating roost-site selection to landscape-level features. Our results indicated that several factors (i.e., distance to nearest corridor and distance to nearest mature pine stand) inﬂuenced roost-site selection and that differences existed between males and females, and among female reproductive condition. Examination of our data suggests that landscape-level features are more important than tree- and plot-level characteristics for roosting by Seminole bats on this managed forest. Corridors may represent a feasible approach to maintaining suitable roosting habitat for Seminole bats in managed forest landscapes.",

            "abstractNote": "As income breeders, lactating female bats rely on current resource intake to support costs of reproduction and so must reconcile the conﬂicting demands of foraging and nursing. We documented changes in the movement of female little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) around roosts between pregnancy and lactation. Home-range size dropped by 51% between pregnancy and lactation, resulting in a 35% decrease in ﬂight distances. Although pregnant females rarely returned to roosts during the night, lactating females returned 1–2 times, which led to an increase in activity at the roosts beginning about 3 h after initial emergence. We argue that their high mass-speciﬁc milk production forces lactating females to nurse at night, which in turn imposes a constraint on foraging distances. The shift to a smaller home range is probably facilitated by the concomitant increase in insect biomass during the July lactation period.",

As predicted, we found no evidence that activity of bats varied directly with intensity of moonlight. However, activity changed depending on height within the forest, and there was a significant interaction between moonlight and height. The shift between vertical levels was not expected if risk of predation was an important selective pressure, because activity was highest in the canopy and lowest at the level of shrubs on bright nights. The most likely explanation for interaction between height and moonlight is that bats adjust use of microhabitats to match distribution of prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Diversification and adaptive radiations are tied to evolvability, which in turn is linked to morphological integration. Tightly integrated structures typically evolve in unison, whereas loosely integrated structures evolve separately. Highly integrated structures are therefore thought to constrain evolutionary change by limiting morphological disparity. Mounting evidence suggests that high integration may facilitate evolutionary change along a single trajectory. We used geometric morphometrics to compare cranial disparity and integration among phyllostomid bats—which exhibit the greatest dietary diversity of any mammalian family— and their sister taxa within the superfamily Noctilionoidea. Our results reveal that phyllostomids are more tightly integrated and have less disparity in cranial shape than their outgroups, despite exhibiting tenfold higher species richness and significantly increased rates of speciation. Phyllostomid cranial morphology appears to have diverged from that of other noctilionoids by evolving along a single axis of morphological variation that describes the relative length of the rostrum. We propose that phyllostomids were able to evolve to occupy a wide range of dietary niches by varying rostrum length, possibly along a line of least evolutionary resistance. This study provides a compelling empirical example of how increased integration can lead to adaptation, implying that both high and low integration can underlie diverse phenotypes in adaptive radiation.",

            "abstractNote": "As the only mammalian group capable of powered ﬂight, bats have many unique biological traits. Previous comparative genomic studies in bats have focused on long-term evolution. However, the microevolutionary processes driving recent evolution are largely under-explored. Using resequencing data from 50 black ﬂying foxes (Pteropus alecto), one of the model species for bats, we ﬁnd that black ﬂying fox has much higher genetic diversity and lower levels of linkage disequilibrium than most of the mammalian species. Demographic inference reveals strong population ﬂuctuations (>100 fold) coinciding with multiple historical events including the last glacial change and Toba super eruption, suggesting that the black ﬂying fox is a very resilient species with strong recovery abilities. While long-term adaptation in the black ﬂying fox is enriched in metabolic genes, recent adaptation in the black ﬂying fox has a unique landscape where recently selected genes are not strongly enriched in any functional category. The demographic history and mode of adaptation suggest that black ﬂying fox might be a well-adapted species with strong evolutionary resilience. Taken together, this study unravels a vibrant landscape of recent evolution for the black ﬂying fox and sheds light on several unique evolutionary processes for bats comparing to other mammalian groups.

            "abstractNote": "Vertebrates capable of powered flight rely on wings, muscles that drive their flapping and sensory inputs to the brain allowing for control of the motor output. In birds, the wings are formed of arrangements of adjacent flight feathers (remiges), whereas the wings of bats consist of double-layered skin membrane stretched out between the forelimb skeleton, body and legs. Bird feathers become worn from use and brittle from UV exposure, which leads to loss of function; to compensate, they are renewed (moulted) at regular intervals. Bird feathers and the wings of bats can be damaged by accident. Wing damage and loss of wing surface due to moult almost invariably cause reduced flight performance in measures such as take-off angle and speed. During moult in birds, this is partially counteracted by concurrent mass loss and enlarged flight muscles. Bats have sensory hairs covering their wing surface that provide feedback information about flow; thus, wing damage affects flight speed and turning ability. Bats also have thin, thread-like muscles, distributed within the wing membrane and, if these are damaged, the control of wing camber is lost. Here, I review the effects of wing damage and moult on flight performance in birds, and the consequences of wing damage in bats. I also discuss studies of life-history trade-offs that make use of experimental trimming of flight feathers as a way to handicap parent birds feeding their young.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats use brief calls for echolocation, suggesting that they might be more sensitive to brief sounds than non-echolocating mammals. To investigate this possibility, absolute thresholds for brief tones were determined for four species of bats: The Common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) and the Greater spear-nosed bat (Phyllostomus hastatus), both of which use frequency-modulated calls, the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), an echolocator that uses tongue-clicks rather than laryngeal calls, and the Dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis), a non-echolocating species. Norway rats and a human were tested for comparison using the same acoustic stimuli. Contrary to expectations, the echolocating bats were not superior to non-echolocating mammals in detecting brief tones in the frequency range of their echolocation calls. Instead, all four species of bats were remarkably less sensitive than non-bats to brief sounds of 10 kHz and below. This implies that temporal summation in the mammalian auditory system can show large species differences, and that the detection of brief sound is likely influenced by the selective pressures on each species as well as by the physical integration of energy in the auditory system. Such species differences in function are expected to be reflected in the physiology of their auditory systems.",

            "abstractNote": "Distress vocalizations (also known as alarm or screams) are an important component of the vocal repertoire of a number of animal species, including bats, humans, monkeys and birds, among others. Although the behavioral relevance of distress vocalizations is undeniable, at present, little is known about the rules that govern vocalization production when in alarmful situations. In this article, we show that when distressed, bats of the species Carollia perspicillata produce repetitive vocalization sequences in which consecutive syllables are likely to be similar to one another regarding their physical attributes. The uttered distress syllables are broadband (12–73 kHz) with most of their energy focussing at 23 kHz. Distress syllables are short (~4 ms), their average sound pressure level is close to 70 dB SPL, and they are produced at high repetition rates (every 14 ms). We discuss that, because of their physical attributes, bat distress vocalizations could serve a dual purpose: (1) advertising threatful situations to conspecifics, and (2) informing the threatener that the bats are ready to defend themselves. We also discuss possible advantages of advertising danger/discomfort using repetitive utterances, a calling strategy that appears to be ubiquitous across the animal kingdom.",

Neurons having best frequencies between 48–72 kHz and between 24–32 kHz are overrepresented. The inferior colliculus neurons had either phasic (consisting in only one response cycle at all stimulus intensities) or long-lasting oscillatory responses (consisting of multiple response cycles). Seventeen percent of neurons displayed paradoxical latency shift, i.e. their response latency increased with increasing sound level. Three types of paradoxical latency shift were found: (1) stable, that does not depend on sound duration, (2) duration-dependent, that grows with increasing sound duration, and (3) progressive, whose magnitude increases with increasing sound level. The temporal properties of paradoxical latency shift neurons compare well with those of neurons having long-lasting oscillatory responses, i.e. median inter-spike intervals and paradoxical latency shift below 6 ms are overrepresented. In addition, oscillatory and paradoxical latency shift neurons behave similarly when tested with tones of diVerent durations. Temporal properties of oscillation and PLS found in the IC of fruiteating bats are similar to those found in the IC of insectivorous bats using downward frequency-modulated echolocation calls.",

Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of seven species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and six species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.",

            "abstractNote": "The baculum (os penis) has been extensively studied as a taxon-speciﬁc character in bats and other mammals but its mechanical function is still unclear. There is a wide consensus in the literature that the baculum is probably a sexually selected character. Using a novel approach combining postmortem manipulation and threedimensional (3D) imaging, we tested two functional hypotheses in the common noctule bat Nyctalus noctula, the common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, and Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii: (i) whether the baculum can protect the distal urethra and urethral opening from compression during erection and copulation; and (ii) whether the baculum and corpora cavernosa form a functional unit to support both the penile shaft and the more distal glans tip. In freshly dead or frozen and thawed bats, we compared ﬂaccid penises with artiﬁcially ‘erect’ penises that were inﬂated with 10% formalin. Penises were stained with alcoholic iodine and imaged with a lab-based high-resolution x-ray microtomography system. Analysis of the 3D images enabled us to compare the changes in relative positions of the baculum, corpora cavernosa, urethra, and corpus spongiosum with one another between ﬂaccid and ‘erect’ penises. Our results support both functional hypotheses, indicating that the baculum probably performs two different roles during erection. Our approach should prove valuable for comparing and testing the functions of different baculum morphologies in bats and other mammals. Moreover, we have validated an essential component of the groundwork necessary to extend this approach with ﬁnite element analysis for quantitative 3D biomechanical modeling of penis function.",

For the ﬁrst time, the parasite is reported to occur in the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), California myotis (Myotis californicus) and the pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus). The western small-footed bat (Myotis ciliolabrum), little brown bat (M. lucifugus) and the western pipistrelle (Parastellus hesperus) are conﬁrmed as host species. The trematodes were isolated from the small intestines of the host individuals. For the ﬁrst time, we identiﬁed P. micracanthos in bats originating from Canada and Mexico. The results presented here suggest that the trematode P. micracanthos has a much larger host range and geographic distribution than previously recognised. It is likely that further studies will conﬁrm this results and extent both host and geographic ranges even further.",

The bats were trained to respond to pure tones in a conditioned suppression/avoidance procedure for a blood reward and a mild punisher for failures to detect the tones. Common vampire bats have a hearing range from 716 Hz to 113 kHz at a level of 60 dB. Their best hearing is at 20 kHz where they are slightly more sensitive than other bats, and they have a second peak of good sensitivity at 71 kHz. They have unusually good sensitivity to low frequencies compared to other bats, but are less sensitive to low frequencies than most mammals. Selective pressures affecting high-frequency hearing in bats and mammals in general are discussed.",

The mean minimum audible angle for two E. helvum was 11.7°, and for two C. brachyotis was 10.5°. This places their passive sound-localization acuity near the middle of the range for echolocating bats as well as the middle of the range for other mammals. Sound-localization acuity varies widely among mammals, and the best predictor of this auditory function remains the width of the ﬁeld of best vision (r = .89, p < .0001). Among echolocating and non-echolocating bats, as well as among other mammals, the use of hearing to direct the eyes to the source of a sound still appears to serve as an important selective factor for sound localization. Absolute visual acuity and the magnitude of the binaural locus cues available to a species remain unreliable predictors of sound-localization acuity.",

Toward this end, we determined the audiograms of two species of non-echolocating bats, the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), a large (230–350 g) African fruit bat, and the dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis), a small (30–45 g) bat native to India and Southeast Asia. A conditioned suppression/avoidance procedure with a fruit juice reward was used for testing. At 60 dB SPL, the hearing range of E. helvum extends from 1.38 to 41 kHz with best sensitivity at 8 kHz; the hearing range of C. brachyotis extends from 2.63 to 70 kHz with best sensitivity at 10 kHz. As with all other bats tested so far, neither species was able to hear below 500 Hz, suggesting that they may not use a time code for perceiving pitch. Comparison of the high-frequency hearing abilities of echolocating and non-echolocating bats suggests that the use of laryngeal echolocation has resulted in additional selective pressure to hear high frequencies. However, the typical high-frequency sensitivity of small non-echolocating mammals would have been suﬃcient to support initial echolocation in the early evolution of bats, a ﬁnding that supports the possibility of multiple origins of echolocation.",

In this study, the leptin gene sequences of both hibernating (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and non-hibernating (Rousettus leschenaultii) bats were determined, and the leptin proteins from these two different species of bats were expressed in Escherichia coli for the ﬁrst time. Results showed that the amino acid sequence of the leptin protein from hibernating bats had a lower degree of identity than that from non-hibernating bats to those of several non-hibernating mammals. The leptin protein of hibernating bats had a stronger growth inhibitory effect on 3T3-L1 cells than that of non-hibernating bats. Structural modeling revealed that the structures of the receptor binding site III, which is critical for signal transduction, of the two bat leptins were very different. Similar to the human leptin, the leptin protein of non-hibernating bats was predicted to have a random loop, whereas that of hibernating bats had a helical structure in this region. This observation provided a clue as to the differential effects of the two different leptins on 3T3-L1 cells.",

            "abstractNote": "Retention forestry, which retains small set-asides within forests managed for timber production and other ser­ vices, is an important conservation instrument for enhancing structural complexity and biodiversity in multi­ functional forests. However, in contrast to local scale effects, its large-scale effectiveness is largely unknown, as this requires area-wide and sufficiently precise information on key structural elements and associated species’ habitats. Bats are particularly sensitive to forest structural characteristics and are target organisms of most retention programs. To assess their response to existing retention efforts, we here compared key habitat struc­ tures and overall habitat suitability for bats across forest areas with and without retention, using forest type and structure variables derived from remote sensing along with topographic, climatic and land-cover variables in a multi-scale modelling approach. Based on acoustic data from 135 1-hectare plots across the Black Forest, Ger­ many, we calibrated region-wide species distribution models for 9 bat species or bat species groups thereby identifying the best-performing scale (50 – 1000 m radius) for each predictor and species(-group). Among predictors and species(-groups), forest cover and structural variables explained most (44.0 % and 38.3 %) of bat habitat selection, with forest height heterogeneity (16.4 %) and the percentage area with standing dead trees (11.7 %) performing best, mostly at small scales (50–100 m). Forests with retention showed higher values of these key structural variables, resulting in higher predicted habitat suitability for all species(-groups), high­ lighting positive effects of retention on structural complexity in forests and on species that benefit thereof.",

            "abstractNote": "Although use of corridors by some wildlife species has been extensively examined, use by bats is poorly understood. From 1 June to 31 August (2004–2005), we used Anabat II detectors to examine bat activity and species occupancy relative to forested corridors on an intensively managed forest landscape in southern South Carolina, USA. We compared bat activity among corridor interiors, corridor edges, and stands adjacent to corridors. We also compared models relating occupancy of bat species to site-level characteristics using an information theoretic approach. We identiﬁed 16,235 call sequences of 8 species and detected bat presence at 89% (n = 320) of sites sampled. Our results indicate higher occupancy rates for bats along corridor edges compared to interior corridor or adjacent stands. Although we found few differences among species with respect to site-level characteristics, occupancy of all bat species was positively associated with corridor overstory height and negatively associated with adjacent stand age. The presence of roads adjacent to corridors positively inﬂuenced occupancy of Eptesicus fuscus, Lasiurus seminolus, and Perimyotis subﬂavus. Our results suggest management practices designed to create and enhance corridors may represent an ecologically sound method for maintaining important bat habitat features (i.e., edge) across managed forest landscapes.",
