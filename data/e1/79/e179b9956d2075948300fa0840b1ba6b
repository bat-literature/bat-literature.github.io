The Cimex pipistrelli species group parasitizes on bats, the likely ancestral hosts of the whole family. Based on morphology, it was suggested that three species of the group were present in the West-Palaearctic region, although their validity remained a matter of discussion. Surprisingly, the status of these species has not been studied from the point of view of host speciﬁcity. We examined the diversiﬁcation of the species group using morphological data, including the putative diagnostic characters, and sequences of one mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase subunit I, COI) and four nuclear loci (internal transcribed spacer 2, 18S and 28s ribosomal genes and elongation factor 1 subunit a). This was carried out on a sample of 225 individuals from 69 bat roosts and 44 mist-netted bats, altogether representing 12 bat species from 13 European countries and Lebanon. We revealed 27 mitochondrial haplotypes representing two distinct haplogroups and one outlying haplotype. The extent of morphological variability of specimens representing both haplogroups covers the range of characters reported for all three recognized species; therefore, the haplogroups clearly do not correspond to any described species. Also, the very limited variability found in the nuclear sequences of the cimicid bugs examined suggests that separate species do not exist in the region. We found considerable morphological differentiation among samples from different bat species, although individuals representing particular mitochondrial haplogroups often live sympatrically and on the same host species. It seems that batbugs are morphologically adapted to a particular bat host despite the low genetic structuring among individuals parasitizing different species of bats.",

(Hemiptera: Cimicidae) has been undergoing a dramatic global resurgence, likely in part to the evolution of mechanisms conferring resistance to insecticides. One such mechanism is knock-down resistance (kdr), resulting from nonsynonymous mutations within the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene. To date, three mutations have been identified in C. lectularius, V419L, L925I, and I936F. Using Sanger sequencing, the frequency and distribution of these VGSC mutations across 131 populations collected from the bat-associated and human-associated lineages of C. lectularius found in Europe are documented. All populations from the bat-associated lineage lacked mutations at the three sites. In contrast, the majority of populations associated with humans (93.5%) possessed the mutation at the L925I site. The I936F mutation, previously only reported in Israel and Australia, was found in nine populations spread across several European countries, including the Czech Republic and Switzerland. The high frequency of kdr-associated resistance already reported in C. lectularius and the occurrence and broad geographic distribution of this additional VGSC mutation, questions the continued use of pyrethroids in the treatment of infestations.",

The legislation governing the keeping of exotic mammals is discussed and an assessment is made of the number of mammals kept in Britain for purposes other than food production. These include 3 200 000 kept for experimental purposes, over 12 848 in zoos, 100 000 Mink on farms and over 11 million households with at least one pet. The results of a recent survey of animals held in Britain under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 are presented; nearly 1000 individuals of at least 76 species are held under this legislation. Between January 1970 and October 1989, 293 exotic mammals, of 39 species not normally kept as household pets, were recorded out of captivity on 127 occasions. An analysis of the sources of these exotics and their subsequent fate is presented. It is suggested that monitoring the occurrence of exotic species out of captivity provides information on which species are most likely to establish feral populations in the future. This will allow preventive measures to be planned and their efficacy to be assessed before a new exotic species becomes established.",

            "abstractNote": "The extent to which migratory bats forage at stopover sites or while in migratory flight is poorly understood. Endogenous fat stores have lower δ13C values relative to the dietary substrates from which they were synthesized, and so, the fed versus fasted state of bats should be discernable by comparing their breath δ13C at capture to that after a known period of fasting. We captured silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) at a stopover site at Long Point, Ontario, Canada, during spring and fall migration. We collected breath samples at capture and after fasting in captivity for 12 h, providing a fasted-state δ13C value corresponding to metabolism of fat stores. We also collected and weighed fecal pellets produced while in captivity. Breath δ13C values at capture were positively correlated with mass of feces produced. During spring migration, δ13C values of breath ­CO2 at capture were low and similar to fasting values, but increased with date consistent with increased foraging at stopover and reliance on exogenous dietary nutrients as the season progressed. The opposite temporal pattern was found during fall migration. Our findings suggest that bats forage during migratory stopover when environmental conditions permit despite potential time trade-offs between feeding and travel, and the energy savings resulting from torpor during roosting. This study provides insight into the eco-physiology of bat migration and shows the importance of foraging habitat for migratory bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The torpor-assisted migration hypothesis posits that migration is facilitated in bats by the use of torpor during stopover roosting periods, and predicts that at stopover bats regulate time in torpor facultatively so that daily energy expenditure is independent of ambient roosting temperature. Energy savings can thus be directed to migratory movement. However, direct measurements of total roosting energy expenditure in relation to ambient and body temperature are lacking. We captured migratory silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans; ∼11g) at Long Point, Ontario, Canada in spring and fall 2016. We used quantitative magnetic resonance analysis to measure body composition change and energy expenditure over a twelve-hour roosting period in a ventilated incubator at 10, 17 and 25°C. We assessed the effects of season, body mass, sex and age on energy expenditure. We found that daily energy expenditure was independent of roosting temperature, and that this was achieved by flexible use of torpor. Variation in body mass at capture was driven mainly by differences in fat, and the amount of body fat was negatively related to torpor use, particularly in spring. Season, sex and age also affected torpor use and energy expenditure, notably with pregnant females being generally fatter and using less torpor than males in spring. We estimate that stopover contributes only 15-20% to the total energy costs of migration in bats compared to 70% or more in typical birds. This study provides support for the torpor-assisted migration hypothesis, and furthers our understanding of the energy budgets of migratory bats.",

Its social and reproductive organisation is complex and the mating system fits a “resource defence polygyny” model. In spring and autumn, aggressive interactions in flight, defence of roosts and mating songs of males to attract females occurred. According to our results, T. teniotis is organised in “harems” consisting of a dominant male and a variable number of females. In addition the sexual cycle displayed a bimodal reproductive pattern (this is unique and remarkable for European bats). The bimodal pattern coincided with peaks in food availability (moths) at high altitudes. Presumably, roostguarding activities (patrolling, advertising…) make males less prone to move away (e.g. at higher altitudes and longer distances) from roosts, resulting in differences in prey selection and in altitudinal segregation between sexes. This provides a plausible explanation for the differences in diet (predation of more sedentary vs. high-flying migratory moths) between males and females that has been found in published studies.",

The only fossil species, Artibeus anthonyi, was described from deposits of the Cuban Quaternary, and its taxonomic status has been debated in the literature. Based on exceptionally well-preserved new fossil material, an emended diagnosis and a detailed description of the cranium of A. anthonyi are presented. In addition, we used multivariate analyses to explore the morphometric differentiation between A. anthonyi and the extant species of the subgenus Artibeus. A. anthonyi shows the greatest morphological divergence compared with extant Artibeus species.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats occupying hibernacula during summer are exposed to Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), the causative agent of white-nose syndrome (WNS), and may contribute to its dispersal. Furthermore, equipment and clothing exposed to cave environments are a potential source for humanassisted spread of Pd. To explore dispersal hazards for Pd during the nonhibernal season, we tested samples that were collected from bats, the environment, and equipment at hibernacula in the eastern US between 18 July–22 August 2012. Study sites included six hibernacula known to harbor bats with Pd with varying winter-count impacts from WNS and two hibernacula (control sites) without prior history of WNS. Nucleic acid from Pd was detected from wing-skin swabs or guano from 40 of 617 bats (7% prevalence), including males and females of five species at five sites where WNS had previously been confirmed as well as from one control site. Analysis of guano collected during summer demonstrated a higher apparent prevalence of Pd among bats (17%, 37/223) than did analysis of wing-skin swabs (1%, 4/ 617). Viable Pd cultured from wing skin (2%, 1/56) and low recapture rates at all sites suggested bats harboring Pd during summer could contribute to pathogen dispersal. Additionally, Pd DNA was detected on clothing and trapping equipment used inside and near hibernacula, and Pd was detected in sediment more readily than in swabs of hibernaculum walls. Statistically significant differences in environmental abundance of Pd were not detected among sites, but prevalence of Pd differed between sites and among bat species. Overall, bats using hibernacula in summer can harbor Pd on their skin and in their guano, and demonstration of Pd on clothing, traps, and other equipment used at hibernacula during summertime within the WNS-affected region indicates risk for pathogen dispersal during the nonhibernal season.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              The establishment of extensive livestock systems in the Colombian Caribbean Region has historically generated a strong loss of the tropical dry forest (TDF) with negative effects on biodiversity. Currently, the implementation of silvopastoral systems (SPS) has been proposed with strategy to curb the loss of biodiversity caused by the conventional management system (CS). The objective was to evaluate the effect of SPS and CS of extensive livestock on the assemblage of bats associated with fragments of TDF. During a continuous year and a sampling effort of 30,240 h-net/night, the structure and composition of bat assemblage between SPS and CS were compared. 2788 bats belonging to six families, 23 genera, and 39 species were captured. The\n              Phyllostomidae\n              family presented the highest species richness (\n              S\n               = 30), with the greatest abundance in the\n              Stenodermatinae\n              subfamily (n = 1543). Bat assemblage in the SPS fragments was more equitable; and the relative abundance per species, per genera, and per foraging guilds was also significantly higher. The capture success showed significant variations between the climatic seasons (dry and rainy). The rate of species turnover was higher in the CS fragments. The species\n              Artibeus planirostris, Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Carollia castanea, Phyllostomus discolor, Dermanura phaeotis, Uroderma convexum, Glossophaga soricina, C. brevicauda,\n              and\n              Sturnira lilium\n              accounted for 92% of the captures. In conclusion, frugivorous bats were more abundant in the SPS, type of extensive livestock management that can generate greater temporal stability of bat assemblage. This research provides the first scientific evidence of the positive effect of silvopastoral management on the diversity of bats in tropical dry forest areas of the Colombian Caribbean region.",

Here we report the results of a pilot study investigating non-invasive DNA sampling of the grey-headed flying-fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), a threatened species that is restricted to the east coast of Australia. We successfully extracted DNA from fresh scats and hair, each of which was of sufficient quality for amplifying mitochondrial DNA markers and microsatellites. A single-locus multitube approach was used to investigate amplification success and genotyping reliability. Faecal samples yielded a higher proportion of successful amplifications and consensus genotype assignments than hair samples. We outline measures that may be utilised to minimise microsatellite genotyping error for future studies. These indirect approaches to obtaining genetic data show much promise given the difficult nature of directly sampling flying-foxes and related species.",

Near feeding sites over water, Myotis lucifugus and M. yumanensis responded positively only to echolocation calls of conspecifics. Near roosts, these bats did not respond before young of the year became volant, and after this responded to presentations of echolocation calls of similar and dissimilar design. At feeding sites Lasiurus borealis responded only to echolocation calls of conspecifics and particularly to \"feeding buzzes\". While Myotis, particularly subadults, appear to use the echolocation calls of conspecifics to locate feeding sites, L. borealis appears to use the calls of a foraging neighbor attacking prey to identify opportunities for 'stealing' food.",

Numerous studies have been carried out to identify new bat viruses related to SARS-coronavirus (bat-SARS-like CoVs) using a reverse-transcribed-polymerase chain reaction assay. However, a qualitative PCR could underestimate the prevalence of infection, affecting the epidemiological evaluation of bats in viral ecology. In this work an SYBR Green-real time PCR assay was developed for diagnosing infection with SARS-related coronaviruses from bat guano and was applied as screening tool in a survey carried out on 45 greater horseshoe bats (\n              Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\n              ) sampled in Italy in 2009. The assay showed high sensitivity and reproducibility. Its application on bats screening resulted in a prevalence of 42%. This method could be suitable as screening tool in epidemiological surveys about the presence of bat-SARS-like CoVs, consequently to obtain a more realistic scenario of the viral prevalence in the population.",

We carried out a survey in colonies of Italian bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) for the presence of coronaviruses. Two of 52 R. ferrumequinum captured from diﬀerent Italian areas tested positive by reverse transcription–PCR for a fragment of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of viruses related to Coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close correlations between one of the positive samples and SARS-related CoV belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus.",

            "abstractNote": "The genus Leptospira encompass 22 species of spirochaetes, with ten pathogenic species that have been recorded in more than 160 mammals worldwide. In the last two decades, the numbers of records of these agents associated with bats have increased exponentially, particularly in America. Although order Chiroptera represents the second most diverse order of mammals in Mexico, and leptospirosis represents a human and veterinary problem in the country, few studies have been conducted to identify potential wildlife reservoirs. The aim of this study was to detect the presence and diversity of Leptospira sp. in communities of bats in an endemic state of leptospirosis in Mexico. During January to September 2016, 81 bats of ten species from three localities of Veracruz, Mexico, were collected with mist nets. Kidney samples were obtained from all specimens. For the detection of Leptospira sp., we amplified several genes using specific primers. Amplicons of the expected size were submitted to sequencing, and sequences recovered were compared with those of reference deposited in GenBank using the BLAST tool. To identify their phylogenetic position, we realized a reconstruction using maximumlikelihood (ML) method. Twenty-five samples from three bat species (Artibeus lituratus, Choeroniscus godmani and Desmodus rotundus) showed the presence of Leptospira DNA. Sequences recovered were close to Leptospira noguchii, Leptospira weilii and Leptospira interrogans. Our results include the first record of Leptospira in bats from Mexico and exhibit a high diversity of these pathogens circulating in the state. Due to the finding of a large number of positive wild animals, it is necessary to implement a surveillance system in populations of the positive bats as well as in related species, in order to understand their role as carriers of this bacterial genus.",

Bats are unique model taxa whose cellular processes are poorly understood, especially in regards to skeletal biology. Forelimb bones of bats, unlike those of terrestrial mammals, bend during ﬂight and function in controlled deformation. As a ﬁrst step towards understanding the molecular processes governing deposition of this ﬂexible bone matrix, we provide the ﬁrst method for isolation and differentiation of cell populations derived from the bone marrow and cortical bone of bats, and compare results with those harvested from C57BL/6J mice. Osteogenic capacity of these cells was assessed via absolute quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and through quantiﬁcation of in vitro mineral deposition. Results indicate the differentiated bone cells of bats display signiﬁcantly lower gene expression of known osteogenic markers (Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX2), osteocalcin (BGLAP) and osterix (SP7)), and deposit a less-mineralized matrix compared with murine controls. By characterizing the in vitro performance of osteoprogenitor cells throughout differentiation and matrix production, this study lays the ground work for in vitro manipulations of bat stem and osteoprogenitor cells and extends our understanding of the cellular diversity across mammals that occupy different habitats.",

High Peak, 2037 m) in the Zambales Mountains, Luzon Island, Philippines in order to obtain the ﬁrst information on the mammals of this newly discovered center of endemism. We also tested two hypotheses regarding the relationship of species richness with elevation and the impact of alien species on native mammals. The survey covered ﬁve localities representing habitats from regenerating lowland rain forest at 860 m to mossy rain forest near the peak at 2024 m. We recorded 11 species, including 1 native shrew, 1 alien shrew, 8 native rodents, and 1 alien rodent. Two species of Apomys and one species of Rhynchomys are endemic to Zambales; this establishes the Zambales Mountains as a signiﬁcant center of mammalian endemism. Species richness of native small mammals increased with elevation, from ﬁve species in the lowlands at 925 m to seven species in mossy forest at 2024 m; total relative abundance of native small mammals increased from 925 to 1690 m, then declined at 2024 m. Alien small mammals were restricted to highly disturbed areas. Our results support the prediction that maximum species richness of small mammals would occur in lower mossy forest near the peak, not near the center of the gradient. Our results also support the hypothesis that when a diverse community of native Philippine small mammals is present in either old-growth or disturbed forest habitat, ‘‘invasive’’ alien species are unable to penetrate and maintain signiﬁcant populations in forest.",

These included one shrew (Soricidae), six fruit bats (Pteropodidae), one ghost bat (Megadermatidae), three horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae), three roundleaf bats (Hipposideridae), four evening bats (Vespertilionidae), one macaque (Cercopithecidae), 12 mice and rats (Muridae), two civets (Viverridae), one wild pig (Suidae), and one deer (Cervidae). Our survey of this small, poorly known mountain range included the discovery of two new species of forest mice (Apomys), a new species of shrew-mouse (Archboldomys), a probable new species of shrew-rat (Rhynchomys), and an unidentified species of tube-nosed bat (Murina). Species richness of bats decreased with increasing elevation, whereas that for native non-volant small mammals increased with increasing elevation up to 1677 m, then declined at 1681 and 1785 m. Statistically significant diel activity and bait preferences were observed among the native non-volant small mammals. Only the two species of small forest mice (Apomys microdon and A. musculus) were captured exclusively above ground; the other non-volant small mammals were nearly always captured on the ground. The Mingan Mountains, with either three or four endemic species, are clearly a significant center of mammalian endemism, deserving of conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Methods and materials: Thin blood ﬁlms from 119 samples from ﬁve possible vertebrate resevoir hosts (bats, birds, Egyptian mongoose, reed buck and rodents) were microscopically examined and screened for the presence of Leishmania parasites. Genomic DNA was extracted from different tissue parts from the same sample. For the molecular detection of the parasite; three genes were successfully ampliﬁed: Leishmania minicircle kDNA, small subunit - ribosomal DNA (SSU-rDNA), and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) which was further characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.\nResults: Leishmania amastigotes were microscopically observed in 14.3% (3 of 21) of the bats collected from DNP. Leishmania speciﬁc genomic target DNA was ampliﬁed in 17.6% of the sample (21 of 119) belonging to ﬁve vertebrate species: the Egyptian mongoose Herpestes ichneumon, the Spiny mice Acomys albegina, the Nile rat Arvicanthis nilotucs, the Reed Buck Redunca arundinum, birds including (the African jacana Actophiloms africanus, Pied kingﬁsher Cerylr rudis, greater painted snipe Rostratula benghalensis) and two bats: Glauconycteris variegata and Scotophilus nigrita. The ITS1-RFLP analysis successfully identiﬁed Leishmania donovani in (2 out of 5) positive samples of bats. All positive samples were collected from DNP.\nConclusion: The detection of Leishmania spp. in bats, birds and reedbuck is the ﬁrst of its kind in Sudan. The ﬁnding of L. donovani in bats from Sudan has serious implications on control programs. More work is needed for further identiﬁcation of the Leishmania species detected in birds and the reedbuck, in addition to the evaluation of the capacity of these animals to transmit the disease.",

            "abstractNote": "Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV), the causative agent of an emerging zoonotic disease in Africa and Arabia, can infect a variety of species, predominantly ruminants, camelids, and humans. While clinical symptoms are mostly absent in adult ruminants and camelids, RVFV infection may lead to a serious, sometimes fatal disease in humans. Virus transmissions between individuals and between species mainly occur through mosquito bites, but direct or even indirect contact with infectious materials may also result in infection. Although the main reservoir of the virus is not yet identified, small mammals such as rodents and bats may act as amplifying hosts. We therefore inoculated Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats that are abundant in northern Africa with the vaccine strain MP-12, in order to elucidate the general competence of this species for virus propagation and transmission. We were able to detect the RVFV genome in the spleen of each of these animals, and re-isolated the virus from the spleen and liver of some animals. Moreover, we were able to identify the Gc RVFV surface antigen in mild subacute multifocal necrotizing hepatic lesions of one bat which was sacrificed 7 days post exposure. These findings demonstrate that Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats can propagate RVFV.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are implicated in the emergence of many zoonotic diseases, including the coronaviruses (CoVs) responsible for deadly outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20022003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) which first emerged in 2012. Despite an increased interest in bat CoVs since the SARS epidemic, little research has examined bat CoVs from a disease ecology perspective. In this thesis, I investigated the epidemiology and ecology of CoVs and bats that host them in Ghana, West Africa. I captured bats at several colonies regularly over two years. Samples were screened for CoVs, which were found to be widespread in insectivorous cave-dwelling bats of the genera Hipposideros and Nycteris. A novel CoV related to MERS-CoV was detected at high prevalence in slit-faced bats, Nycteris cf. gambiensis, supporting suggestions of a bat origin of MERS-CoV. I examined population and individual-level risk factors for infection with four CoVs in Nycteris cf. gambiensis, Hipposideros abae, and H. cf. ruber. I found a strong seasonal effect on CoV infection rates, and a strong association with age, whereby juvenile bats are at greater risk of infection, as well as evidence for higher risk with low body condition. These findings provide new insights into the ecological, demographic and temporal processes that influence CoV infection dynamics in bats, with implications for public health management to prevent virus spillover to humans and domestic animals. In the second half of my thesis, I examined the evolution of cryptic species, and genetic and acoustic diversity in CoV-hosts Hipposideros caffer and H. ruber. Using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci, and acoustic and morphological data, I showed that mitochondrial DNA clades represent distinct species, with no evidence of interbreeding between groups. I then used mitochondrial sequence data to date lineage divergence, and explore the historical and evolutionary processes that may have given rise to diversity in these taxa. Further, I characterised spatial patterns of intraspecific genetic diversity in the three species corresponding to H. cf. ruber (H. sp. B, C, and D). Comparison shows stark contrasts in the spatial patterns of genetic variation of these species, despite them having diverged relatively recently and apparently having highly similar ecological and natural history traits. I discuss the implications of these results fo\n\nviii disease surveillance and spread, wildlife management, and the evolutionary processes that generate and maintain diversity. The findings of this thesis add to knowledge of bat CoV ecology and epidemiology, as well as to the evolution and patterns of diversity within a relatively widespread, but understudied, group of Afrotropical bats that are natural CoV hosts. The results are discussed in the context of zoonoses, wildlife management and disease prevention, and the evolution of cryptic species in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Levels of biodiversity are globally underestimated, especially in tropical ecosystems. This is particularly so for bats compared to other mammalian taxa, due to morphological conservatism. Here, we investigate West African bats of the Hipposideros caffer complex, an insectivorous bat group occurring throughout the Afrotropics. From samples collected in Ghana, we aim to resolve the cryptic diversity identified by mitochondrial (mt) DNA using nuclear genetic, acoustic, and external morphometric data. We confirmed the presence of four previously established mtDNA lineages within the H. caffer complex and found significant genetic divergence among lineages based on nuclear microsatellite data and significant differences in frequencies of echolocation calls and morphometric measures. From these new data, we conclude that H. caffer complex in West Africa consists of at least four distinct species. While the small-­sized species from coastal savanna could be assigned to H. caffer tephrus, the taxonomic identity of the three sympatric, similarly sized species pertaining to H. ruber from the forest zone of Central Ghana is yet to be assessed.",

            "abstractNote": "Human alteration of the planet’s terrestrial landscapes for agriculture, habitation and commerce is reshaping wildlife communities. The threat of land cover change to wildlife is pronounced in regions with rapidly growing human populations. We investigated how species richness and species-specific occurrence of bats changed as a function of land cover and canopy (tree) cover across a rapidly changing region of Florida, USA. Contrary to our predictions, we found negligible effects of agriculture and urban development on the occurrence of all species. In contrast, we found that a remotely sensed metric of canopy cover on a broad scale (25 km2) was a good predictor of the occurrence of eight out of ten species. The occurrence of all smaller bats (vespertilionids) in our study increased with 0–50% increases in canopy cover, while larger bats showed different patterns. Occurrence of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) decreased with increasing canopy cover, and Florida bonneted bats (Eumops floridanus) were not influenced by canopy cover. We conclude that remotely sensed measures of canopy cover can provide a more reliable predictor of bat species richness than land-cover types, and efforts to prevent the loss of bat diversity should consider maintaining canopy cover across mosaic landscapes with diverse land-cover types.",

            "abstractNote": "Anthropogenic activities continue to degrade natural montane ecosystems globally. Bats communities are altered by these changes. We analyzed how bats are affected by human-induced habitat changes by comparing the bat species diversity and functional diversity in undisturbed forest habitats and disturbed forest habitats of the Afromontane biome of Cameroon. We recorded 244 individuals from 13 species in the undisturbed forest, while 233 individuals from 16 species were recorded in the disturbed forest. Bat diversity was higher in disturbed habitats (D = 0.84) than undisturbed habitats (D = 0.67). Jackknife 1 species richness estimator suggests 21.53 species for the disturbed forest and 19.30 in the undisturbed forest. Closed-space forager insectivorous bats made up nearly half of the species in the undisturbed forest, but this dropped to 25% in the disturbed forest, meanwhile, edge-space foragers increased in the disturbed forest. Bat community analyses by ordination revealed a distinct bat community composition between the two forest types, demonstrated as a signiﬁcant difference in diversity between the two forest types. The distribution of Rousettus aegyptiacus, Myonycteris angolensis, Hipposideros cf. ruber, and Micropteropus pusillus contribute the most to the difference in bat community composition between the two forest types. Edge and open-space species were likely to beneﬁt from additional resources provided by the disturbed area, by expanding their range and distribution. However, this may not compensate for the decline in the population of forest species caused by the loss of pristine forests, thus measures to conserve montane forest remnants should be of utmost signiﬁcance.",

This order harbors viruses of high variability which have a great possibility of acquiring the capacity of infecting other animals, including humans. Bats are the natural reservoir for several viruses genetically closely related to the SARScoronavirus which is the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a human epidemic which emerged in China in 2002-2003. In the last few years, it has been discovered that the association between coronaviruses and bats is a worldwide phenomenon, and it has been hypothesised that all mammalian coronaviruses were derived from ancestral viruses residing in bats. This review analyzes the role of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses focusing more extensively on SARS-related coronaviruses and taking into account the role of African and European strains in the evolutionary history of these viruses.",

Our observations indicate that the construction and maintenance of stem tents are primarily, if not exclusively, the behaviour of single males. A stem tent is formed in V. scundens when a single male C. sphinx severs up to 300 small- to medium-sized stems creating a partially flattened, bell-shaped cavity, and in P. fongifolia when a male severs a few medium- to small-sized branches and many leaf petioles, creating an entry/exit portal and space in which to roost. A tent constructed in V. scandens is completed in approximately 30 d, whereas one in P. longifoliu is completed in about 50 d. Stem-tent construction takes place mostly at night, but some stem chewing occurs in late afternoon. At night a stem tent is occupied by a single male, whereas females are usually absent. During the day the number of bats occupying completed tents is highly variable, ranging from two to 19 females (and their pups) and a single adult male. Tent construction is annually bimodal, which corresponds to a biannual breeding season. A dominant male sometimes deposits saliva on branches inside his tent cavity and actively defends this space from intrusions by other males. Both behaviours suggest forms of scent marking and territorial display. O u r observations indicate that dominant males construct tents, recruit females and then defend the tents (and their female occupants) for the purpose of gaining reproductive access. The variance in harem group size indicates that some tent-making males are more successful than others in recruiting females.",

The objective of this work was to make a list of the wild mammals collected and registered in the ejido X-Can, municipality of Chemax, Yucatán, México. For this study, ethnozoological techniques such as interviews and participatory diagnostic workshops were used. Trail tours were also carried out in various points of the ejido for the registration of species through direct methods (sightings, Tomahawk, Sherman traps, nets) and indirect (footprints, excreta, burrows). 31 species, 20 families and seven orders were recorded. The most diverse orders were Chiroptera and Rodentia with nine species each, followed by Carnivora with seven species. The species Coendou mexicanus, Dasyprocta punctata, Cuniculus paca, Panthera onca, Herpailurus yagouaroundi, Eira barbara, Mustela frenata and Dicotyles crassus were only registered by social techniques. During the study, five types of uses were identified such as food, medicinal, pet, artisanal and ceremonial use; in the latter, species such as the white-tailed deer, the collared peccary and the tepezcuintle are used in the ceremony called Ch’a’acháak. The species Odocoileus virginianus was the one with the highest number of uses (4). The ejido X-can has fragments of medium-deciduous forest with priority mammal species for conservation. Activities such as integral ecotourism could guarantee the conservation of the present biodiversity in the medium and long term. Likewise, it is essential to disseminate the ecological and economic importance of mammals among the inhabitants.",

In total, we recorded 29 bat species belonging to 16 genus and 8 families. Microchiopteran bats are more diversified (21 species), but less abundant compared to Megachiropteran bats in this reserve. During this survey, a species is recorded for the first time for Cameroon: Epomops buettikoferi. This record raises the species total for that country from 71 to 72.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Despite their abundance and ecological importance, bats are under significant threat worldwide. There is little information about their distribution, roosting, and habitat requirement for most species, making assessing which species is threatened or in need of special conservation measures difficult. The knowledge gap may partly be due to limitations of the old methods of studying bats which mainly involved capture/or observational techniques. Material and methods: In order to evaluate the potential of identifying insectivorous bats by their echolocation calls in the Sahelian zone of northern Cameroon, 65 bats belonging to five species were captured using standard mist netting: Mops condylurus, Chaerephon major, Mops niveiventer, Scotophilus dinganii, and Scotophilus leucogaster. The bats were identified by using morphometric measurements. An Anabat SD1 detector was later used to record echolocation calls of each individual bat in flight after it was hand-released. The sonogram of each individual bat was analyzed using Analook and categorized into two call types (frequency modulation and frequency modulation/ quasi constant frequency) in order to develop a library of bat reference calls that could be used for a qualitative acoustic survey and species identification. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was applied to search phase calls of the 65 individual bats in order to evaluate the potential for classifying calls into five species groups. Seven parameters calculated from each search phase call were used to classify calls.\nResults: Bats where place into two groups according to the structure of calls: FM bats (Mops condylurus, Chaerephon major, Mops niveiventer) and FM/QCF bats (Scotophilus dinganii and Scotophilus leucogaster). The DFA resulted in a correct overall classification of 69.7%.\nConclusion: This preliminary study showed that DFA of call parameters is a feasible method that can be used to identify insectivorous bats in the region by their echolocation calls.",

            "abstractNote": "Sergey I. Ognev (1886–1951), one of Russia’s most famous biologists, was both a theoretical scientist and a great ﬁeld researcher. Ognev’s “Fauna Mosquensis” (1913) is the most comprehensive study of the mammals of European Russia after Pallas. Throughout his life, Ognev’s work involved two important components: biological observation in nature and study of geographical distribution. His combination of excellent knowledge of natural habitats and morphology created a unique insight. This effort resulted in seven volumes of “Mammals of Eastern Europe and Northern Asia” and “Mammals of the USSR and Adjacent Countries,” published from 1928 to 1950. This work included comprehensive taxonomic accounts, detailed morphological descriptions, geographical ranges and natural history data for 264 mammalian species and 635 forms. 4879 pages were illustrated, including almost 2000 photographs and drawings of skulls and dentition, a huge number of distributional maps made by the author and 56 color ﬁgures drawn by famous animal painters. The taxonomic position of a surprisingly large portion of forms classiﬁed by Ognev have been conﬁrmed by modern molecular genetic approaches. Ognev also authored signiﬁcant books on ecology and ﬁeld photography. It is impossible to overestimate the signiﬁcance of Ognev’s contribution to mammal studies; his “Mammals of the USSR…” volumes remain one of the most cited works in the ﬁeld.",

Understanding these dynamics improves our ability to predict zoonotic spillover from the reservoir hosts.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    To this end, we followed henipavirus antibody levels of >100 individual\n                    E. helvum\n                    in a closed, captive, breeding population over a 30‐month period, using a powerful novel antibody quantitation method.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We demonstrate the presence of maternal antibodies in this system and accurately determine their longevity. We also present evidence of population‐level persistence of viral infection and demonstrate periods of increased horizontal virus transmission associated with the pregnancy/lactation period.\n                \n                \n                  The novel findings of infection persistence and the effect of pregnancy on viral transmission, as well as an accurate quantitation of chiropteran maternal antiviral antibody half‐life, provide fundamental baseline data for the continued study of viral infections in these important reservoir hosts.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are an important source of viral zoonoses, including paramyxoviruses. The paramyxoviral Pararubulavirus genus contains viruses mostly derived from bats that are common, diverse, distributed throughout the Old World, and known to be zoonotic. Here, we describe a new member of the genus Achimota pararubulavirus 3 (AchPV3) and its isolation from the urine of African straw-coloured fruit bats on primary bat kidneys cells. We sequenced and analysed the genome of AchPV3 relative to other Paramyxoviridae, revealing it to be similar to known pararubulaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of AchPV3 revealed the failure of molecular detection in the urine sample from which AchPV3 was derived and an attachment protein most closely related with AchPV2-a pararubulavirus known to cause cross-species transmission. Together these findings add to the picture of pararubulaviruses, their sources, and variable zoonotic potential, which is key to our understanding of host restriction and spillover of bat-derived paramyxoviruses. AchPV3 represents a novel candidate zoonosis and an important tool for further study.",

In both data sets, values that distinguish Erophylla from Phyllonycteris are in the general range of values that characterize congeneric species of mammals. Immunological distance values for the species Glossophaga soricina, Monophyllus redmani, Anoura caudifer, Leptonycteris sanborni, Choeroniscus minor, and Hylonycteris underwoodi indicate that these taxa are approximately equidistant from the Brachyphyllinae. Immunological comparisons of Glossophaga and Monophyllus to Anoura, Leptonycteris, Choeroniscus, and Hylonycteris indicate that the four latter genera are more closely related to Glossophaga and Monophyllus than Glossophaga and Monophyllus are to the genera of the Brachyphyllinae. Values from Lonchophylla thomasi and Lionycteris spurrelli suggest a more distant relationship of these glossophagine genera to the Brachyphyllinaethan the other glossophagine genera examined. Our data suggest that a 2N = 32, FN = 60 karyotype like that characteristic of Glossophaga is primitive for a clade including the Brachyphyllinae and the glossophagine genera Anoura, Glossophaga, Monophyllus, Leptonycteris, Hylonycteris, and Choeroniscus. These data suggest that the polyphyletic origin of certain glossophagine genera, as proposed by Baker (1967), is unlikely.",

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT 1. Urban areas are predicted to grow signiﬁcantly in the foreseeable future because of increasing human population growth. Predicting the impact of urban development and expansion on mammal populations is of considerable interest due to possible effects on biodiversity and human-wildlife conﬂict. 2. The British government has recently announced a substantial housing programme to meet the demands of its growing population and changing socio-economic proﬁle. This is likely to result in the construction of high-density, low-cost housing with small residential gardens. To assess the potential effects of this programme, we analysed the factors affecting the current pattern of use of residential gardens by a range of mammal species using a questionnaire distributed in wildlife and gardening magazines and via The Mammal Society. 3. Twenty-two species/species groups were recorded. However, the pattern of garden use by individual species was limited, with only six species/species groups (bats, red fox Vulpes vulpes, grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, mice, voles) recorded as frequent visitors to > 20% of gardens in the survey. 4. There was a high degree of association between the variables recorded in the study, such that it was difﬁcult to quantify the effects of individual variables. However, all species/species groups appeared to be negatively affected by the increased fragmentation and reduced proximity of natural and semi-natural habitats, decreasing garden size and garden structure, but to differing degrees. Patterns of garden use were most clearly affected by house location (city, town, village, rural), with garden use declining with increasing urbanization for the majority of species/species groups, except red foxes and grey squirrels. Increasing urbanization is likely to be related to a wide range of interrelated factors, any or all of which may affect a range of mammal species. 5. Overall, the probable effects of the planned housing development programme in Britain are not likely to be beneﬁcial to mammal populations, although the pattern of use examined in this study may represent patterns of habitat selection by species rather than differences in distribution or abundance. Consequently, additional data are required on the factors affecting the density of species within urban environments.",
