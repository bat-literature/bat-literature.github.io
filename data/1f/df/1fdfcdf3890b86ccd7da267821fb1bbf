We explored the variability of isotopic niches using δ13C and δ15N ratios in fur from female and male bats in different reproductive states: pregnant, reproductive (but not pregnant at the time of this study), and nonreproductive females; nonscrotal and scrotal males using Bayesian standard ellipse areas and generalized linear models. Reproductive status was an informative predictor for the observed variation of both δ13C and δ15N ratios. Pregnant females displayed the highest mean δ13C and δ15N ratios and were distinct from other reproductive states. Reproductive females exhibited significantly higher δ15N ratios than nonreproductive females or nonscrotal and scrotal males, which may reflect state-dependent foraging and/or higher metabolic stress. Scrotal males displayed the lowest mean δ13C and δ15N ratios. Nonscrotal males exhibited the broadest isotopic niche, whereas reproductive females had the narrowest isotopic niche. Differences in isotopic niche sizes between the different reproductive groups may relate to variable individual feeding behavior and/or geographically different foraging areas/migratory stopover sites at individual and intraspecific levels in M. natalensis. This suggests that group-living, cave-dwelling bats may employ individual foraging specialization to facilitate coexistence in the broader geographic landscape.",

As a step towards the conservation of caves and cave-dwelling bats in South Africa, this study aimed to (i) broadly identify the number of caves used by bats (any species) and speciﬁcally M. natalensis, throughout South Africa, (ii) investigate the number of maternity and hibernacula roosts currently known for M. natalensis, (iii) assess the number of caves located in formal protected areas, (iv) determine potential migration paths/corridors between hibernacula and maternity sites and (v) evaluate the potential threats (like onshore wind facilities) along potential migratory routes. A meta-analysis of scientiﬁc literature and websites was conducted to identify caves throughout South Africa and locations of maternity and hibernacula roosts for M. natalensis. Roosts were assessed to determine whether (i) they were located in protected areas, (ii) they were used for eco-tourism and (iii) the distance to primary roads and onshore wind energy facilities. Next, likely migratory paths were modelled between maternity and hibernacula sites using least-cost path analysis and the threats along potential routes were investigated. A total of 92 caves were identiﬁed, 50 were reported to contain bats. M. natalensis were recorded in 37 caves, and of those, only 9% are currently located inside protected areas. A total of 12 least-cost paths were modelled, and various paths intersected potential threat risk elements. Our analysis provides the ﬁrst description of the potential migration corridors for M. natalensis in South Africa, as well as the current conservation status of bat-inhabited caves. For a developing country set to experience increased urbanisation pressures, this study highlights the need for conservation measures for South African caves and the dependent bats.",

Apparent survival of adult females over winter was calculated using markrecapture analysis over 5 years. Annual survival varied from 0.75 (95% CI = 0.54-0.88) to 0.89 (0.48-0.99) at Hanging Rock and 0.55 (0.39-0.71) to 0.91 (0.44-0.99) at Grand Canyon. Estimates of apparent survival were consistent with those from a longer-term study of long-tailed bats in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, South Island. The intrinsic rate of increase (λ) at Hanging Rock was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.4-0.99), indicating that this population may be declining more rapidly than that in the Eglinton Valley. At Grand Canyon, population estimates fluctuated annually, with no clear trend. Predation by introduced mammals and loss of habitat likely caused declines at Hanging Rock. Management of these factors is essential to avoid the local extinction of the species. Long-term monitoring (greater than 5 years) is required to determine more robust population trends for these long-tailed bat populations.",

Thermal imaging and an array of ultrasonic microphones were used to investigate the acoustic adaptations made during high-speed re-entry for single bats entering a cave. There was a signiﬁcant overall effect between bat, distance to the ground, and its ﬂight speed on pulse duration and interpulse interval (IPI). The data imply that overall bats reduce pulse duration, IPI, and bandwidth as they approach the cave and slow down, but the behavior changes among individuals.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats face numerous threats associated with global environmental change, including the rapid expansion of wind-energy facilities, emerging infectious disease, and habitat loss. An understanding of the movement and migration patterns of these highly dispersive animals would help reveal how spatially localized the impacts from these threats are likely to be on bat populations, thus aiding in their conservation. Stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δ2H) can be used to infer regions where bats have foraged during the summer molt season, thus allowing an assessment of summering location and distance of movement of bats sampled during other times of year. However, a major impediment to the application of δ2H for inference of bat movements is that the relationship between δ2H of bat hair and precipitation tends to be species specific and is still unknown for some key species of conservation concern. We addressed this issue by using geo-referenced museum specimens to calibrate the relationship between δ2H of hair (δ2Hhair) and long-term δ2H of growing-season precipitation (δ2HGSprecip) at the site of collection for eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), one of the main species of bats experiencing large numbers of fatalities at wind-energy facilities in North America. Based on comparison of δ2Hhair and δ2HGSprecip values for males we estimated a period of molt of June 14–August 7. Within this period, male and female red bats exhibited a significant positive relationship between δ2Hhair and δ2HGSprecip. These results establish the relationship between δ2Hhair and δ2HGSprecip for red bats, which is necessary for the use of δ2Hhair to infer the movement and migration patterns of this important species. These results provide a critical resource to conservation biologists working to assess the impacts of environmental change on bat populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats require different resources for diurnal roosting and nocturnal feeding, and sound conservation planning requires knowledge of both. However, ranging behavior and habitat use by foraging bats are poorly known, especially within urban ecosystems. We studied foraging ﬂight behavior and use of an urban landscape by 14 white-striped free-tailed bats (Tadarida australis) in metropolitan Brisbane, Australia. Each evening, the bats emerged from day-roosts in tree-hollows and commuted rapidly to a feeding area (median travel speed 42.9 km/h, based on net distances moved during 10–20 min). Within 30 min from emergence their travel speed was greatly reduced (median 6.7 km/h) to a level that remained similar throughout subsequent hours while they foraged. Day-roosts were widely dispersed across the urban landscape, but foraging bats mostly restricted their movements to a localized area of a few kilometers diameter. This area was closer to a communal roost, visited periodically by all bats, than to their day-roosts (median distance from foraging bats to the communal roost 2.5 km; to their day-roosts 6.2 km). The bats showed a signiﬁcant preference for foraging above ﬂoodplain habitat, and did not prefer to feed above remnant forest. T. australis appears tolerant of deforestation and capable of persisting in urban landscapes, provided that roost trees are protected. However, it remains unknown whether a sustained availability of aerial prey depends on ﬂoodplains remaining undeveloped.",

This is the third known species of this endemic Philippine genus. The new species is distinguished from its congeners by consistent differences in adult body size, limb and tail proportions, coloration and texture of the pelage, and cranial and dental dimensions. Members of this genus are small, diurnal rodents that feed mainly on earthworms and other soil invertebrates, and occur in high elevation montane and mossy forests habitats. The new species may be restricted to the northern portion of the Cordillera Central, whereas its congeners occur in widely separated highland areas in other portions of Luzon. The fact that similar distribution patterns are seen for members of other endemic genera suggests that habitat vicariance may have shaped much of the diversiﬁcation of murid rodents on Luzon.",

Most studies to date have produced contrasting results focused on the effect of a single parasite species despite the fact that hosts usually harbour a community of parasites that influences one another's impact on host immune response.\n                \n                \n                  We simultaneously assessed blood parasites, intestinal parasites and ectoparasite loads in male blackbirds and compared these measures to several immune indices to investigate how parasites explain the variation around the mean of these immune indices.\n                \n                \n                  Parasite loads covaried within hosts. Immune indices better reflected the interacting effects of these parasites than their independent effect. Immune indices may therefore be better indicators of ongoing pathogenic infections than immunocompetence. Furthermore, intestinal parasites explained a significant part of the variance in most immune indices through their interactions with other parasites, suggesting that they have a strong influence in modulating immune function.\n                \n                \n                  Taking the parasite community into account in immunoecology studies will certainly help increase our understanding of immune indices.",

            "abstractNote": "Recent research has highlighted roles for non-coding RNA i7n the regulation of stress tolerance in bats. In this study, we propose that microRNA could also play an important role in neuronal maintenance during hibernation. To explore this possibility, RT-PCR was employed to investigate the expression of eleven microRNAs from the brain tissue of euthermic control and torpid bats. Results show that eight microRNAs (miR-21, -29b, -103, -107, -124a, -132, -183 and -501) increased (1.2-1.9 fold) in torpid bats, while the protein expression of Dicer, a microRNA processing enzyme, did not significantly change during torpor. Bioinformatic analysis of the differentially expressed microRNA suggests that these microRNAs are mainly involved in two processes: (1) focal adhesion and (2) axon guidance. To determine the extent of microRNA sequence conservation in the bat, we successfully identified bat microRNA from sequence alignments against known mouse (Mus musculus) microRNA. We successfully identified 206 conserved pre-microRNA sequences, leading to the identification of 344 conserved mature microRNA sequences. Sequence homology of the identified sequences was found to be 94.76. ±. 3.95% and 98.87. ±. 2.24% for both pre- and mature microRNAs, respectively. Results suggest that brain function related to the differentiation of neurons and adaptive neuroprotection may be under microRNA control during bat hibernation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

            "abstractNote": "The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is known to be present in bats of the family Phyllostomidae, but in most species this is inferred from the presence of accessory olfactory bulbs. Like primates, bats have profound intergroup variations in the vomeronasal system. Of the family Phyllostomidae (49 genera, 143 species) the VNO of approximately 60 species has been studied. Here, we report light microscopic observations of the VNO of Anoura geoffroyi (fetus and adult), A. caudifer, and A. cultrata, as well as ultrastructural observations of the VNO in adult A. geoffroyi. The organ is crescent-shaped, with a wide lumen encroached by a ‘‘mushroom body’’ that contains a venous sinus. In adults, the vomeronasal cartilage is reduced, being longer in absolute length in fetal A. geoffroyi compared with the adult. In the neuroepithelium, the receptor cell microvilli are dark, distinct, and short, emerging from a vesicular tuft; the supporting cell microvilli are relatively much longer. Large paravomeronasal ganglia are observed. The receptor-free epithelium is undulating and lacks cilia or microvilli. Some characteristics of the VNO in Anoura have not been reported in other chiropterans to date, such as the marked reduction of the vomeronasal cartilage and absence of cilia in the receptor-free epithelium. Moreover, if A. geoffroyi is representative, the genus has an adult neuroepithelial volume similar to other mammals of its body size. Further examination of uninvestigated phyllostomid VNOs may elucidate a phylogenetic history of the family, as well as ecological or social correlates of the VNO in the order Chiroptera.

In this study, we tested hypotheses concerning differences in occurrence, in periods of activity and reproduction, in morphology and diet between two sympatric and phylogenetically related bat species (Artibeus lituratus and A. planirostris) in the Cerrado region of Central Brazil. No differences were found in the occurrence, activity patterns, or breeding season between species. In contrast, the species presented dissimilar morphological traits and diets (28% of overlap in diet). Our analysis suggests that A. lituratus and A. planirostris do not compete strongly with each other. This lack of competition between species facilitates coexistence on a local scale in the studied Neotropical savanna.",

The pond bat (\n              Myotis dasycneme\n              ) is a rare species classified as “Near Threatened” with a wide but patchy Palearctic distribution. A total of 277 samples representing populations in Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Hungary, and Russia were used in the genetic analyses; 224 samples representing Denmark, Germany, and Russia were analyzed at 10 microsatellite loci; 241 samples representing all areas were analyzed using mitochondrial D‐loop and cytochrome B sequences. A Bayesian clustering approach revealed two poorly resolved clusters, one representing the Danish and German groups and the other the Russian group. However, significantly different pairwise\n              F\n              ST\n              and\n              D\n              EST\n              estimates were observed between the Danish and German groups and between the Danish and Russian groups suggesting a recent population structure. These conflicting results might be attributed to the effect of migration or low resolution due to the number of microsatellite markers used. After concatenating the two mitochondrial sequences, analysis detected significant genetic differentiation between all populations, probably due to genetic drift combined with a founder event. The phylogenetic tree suggested a closer relationship between the Russian and Northern European populations compared to the Hungarian population, implying that the latter belongs to an older ancestral population. This was supported by the observed haplotype network and higher nucleotide diversity in this population. The genetic structuring observed in the Danish/German pond bat stresses the need for a cross‐border management between the two countries. Further, the pronounced mtDNA structuring, together with the indicated migration between nearby populations suggest philopatric female behavior but male migration, emphasizes the importance of protecting suitable habitat mosaics to maintain a continuum of patches with dense pond bat populations across the species' distribution range.",

These impacts include livestock mortality, animal testing costs, post-exposure prophylaxis costs, and human mortality risk. Mitigation of the impacts can be achieved by vaccinating livestock and controlling vampire bat populations. A beneﬁt-cost analysis was performed to examine the economic efﬁciency of these methods of mitigation, and Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the impact that uncertainty has on the analysis. We found that livestock vaccination is efﬁcient, with beneﬁts being over six times higher than costs. However, bat control is inefﬁcient because beneﬁts are very unlikely to exceed costs. It is concluded that when these mitigation methods are judged by the metric of economic efﬁciency, livestock vaccination is desirable but bat control is not.",

The data presented here suggest strongly M.SM-1 and 2 in R. f. nippon were formed by centric fusion of four of five small A-autosome pairs such as those in A-23~25, 27 and 28 of R. c. cornutus, while occurrence of M-SM-3 in the former was caused by pericentric inversion of a small A-pair such as that in A-24 or 25 of the latter, confirming the assumption described in our previous report (ANDo et al. 1980a). On the other hand, appearance of the secondary short arms of A-autosomes in R. /. nippon is attributable to the C-band material added to the telomeres of A-autosomes. Addition of heterochromatin is considered to have taken place also in the short arm of the ST-X chromosome in R. /. nippon, and to have brought about the morphological difference of the Y chromosome within Rinolopbus.",

We analyzed data on bat attacks for the period between 2007 and 2012, provided by the Pará State Secretariat for Municipal Public Health (SMS) and the Pará State Agricultural Defense Agency (ADEPARA). We recorded 121 attacks in humans in the municipality of Pacajá, in 28 localities, including both rural and urban areas. Urban cases accounted for almost a fifth (19.8%) of all records. No significant variation was found in the number of cases recorded each year (H = 7.28, d.f. = 5, P = 0.20), although significant variation was found in the spatial distribution of the reports (Q = 17.08, d.f. = 5, P < 0.01), reflecting the heterogeneity of the occurrence of attacks. Our conclusion is that the major reduction in the number of reported attacks on humans by hematophagous bats in the municipality of Pacajá is a positive result of the notification by the local people to the public health authorities, which appears to be an effective tool of the prophylactic scheme to control this epizootic in the rural zone of the Brazilian Amazon basin.",

            "abstractNote": "Recently, an increasing number of Bartonella species have been emerged to cause human diseases. Among animal reservoirs for Bartonella spp., bats stand out due to their high mobility, wide distribution, social behaviour and long‐life span. Although studies on the role of vampire bats in the epidemiology of rabies have been extensively investigated in Latin America, information on the circulation and genetic diversity of Bartonella species in these bat species is scarce. In the present work, 208 vampire bats, namely Desmodus rotundus (the common vampire bat; n = 167), Diphylla ecaudata (the hairy‐legged vampire bat; n = 32) and Diaemus youngii (the white‐winged vampire bat; n = 9) from 15 different states in Brazil were sampled. DNA was extracted from liver tissue samples and submitted to real‐time PCR (qPCR) and conventional PCR (cPCR) assays for Bartonella spp. targeting five genetic loci, followed by phylogenetic and genotype network analyses. Fifty‐one out of 208 liver samples (24.51%) were positive for Bartonella DNA in the ITS real‐time PCR assay [40 (78.43%) of them were from D. rotundus from 11 states, and 11 (21.57%) samples from D. ecaudata from three states. Eleven genotypes were found for each gltA and rpoB genes. Several ITS sequences detected in the present study clustered within the lineage that includes B. bacilliformis and B. ancachensis. The Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on the gltA gene positioned the obtained sequences in six different clades, closely related to Bartonella genotypes previously detected in D. rotundus and associated ectoparasites sampled in Latin America. On the other hand, the Bartonella rpoB genotypes clustered together with the ruminant species, B. schoenbuchensis and B. chomelii. The present study describes for the first time the molecular detection of Bartonella spp. in D. ecaudata bats. It also indicates that Bartonella spp. of vampire bats are genetically diverse and geographically widespread in Brazil.",

            "abstractNote": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of putrescine on ovarian activity and the rate of embryonic development in Cynopterus sphinx during delayed development. The result showed the presence of a rate‐limiting enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase‐1, in both ovary and utero‐embryonic unit of C. sphinx suggests a synthesis of putrescine in these sites. The corpus luteum showed increased, whereas utero‐embryonic unit showed decreased production of putrescine during delayed development as compared with the normal development. The bat treated in vivo with putrescine during delayed development showed increase in progesterone and estradiol synthesis, correlated with increased expression of luteinizing hormone receptor, steroidogenic acute receptor protein, and 3β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase through extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK1/2)‐mediated pathway in the ovary; but showed increase in the weight and expression of progesterone receptor (PR), B‐cell lymphoma 2, proliferating cell nucleus antigen, and vascular endothelial growth factor proteins in utero‐embryonic unit. The in vitro treatment of putrescine showed stimulatory whereas treatment with an inhibitor of putrescine, 2‐difluoromethylornithine caused an inhibitory effect on ovarian progesterone synthesis and cell proliferation, and cell survival in the utero‐embryonic unit. In conclusion, the putrescine showed two separate roles during embryonic diapause, high concentration of putrescine in the ovary may support corpus luteum and basal synthesis of progesterone, whereas a low level of putrescine causes retarded embryonic development by inhibiting cell proliferation in the utero‐embryonic unit. The bat treated with putrescine either directly promotes cell proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenic activities or acts indirectly increasing PR on utero‐embryonic unit thereby activating development in delayed embryo in C. sphinx.",

Adiponectin receptor (ADIPOR1) abundance was first observed to be lower during the delayed versus non-delayed periods of uteroembryonic unit development. The effects of adiponectin treatment on embryonic development were then evaluated during the period of delayed development. Exogenous treatment increased the in vivo rate of embryonic development, as indicated by an increase in weight, ADIPOR1 levels in the utero-embryonic unit, and histological changes in embryonic development. Treatment with adiponectin during embryonic diapause showed a significant increase in circulating progesterone and estradiol concentrations, and in production of their receptors in the utero-embryonic unit. The adiponectin-induced increase in estradiol synthesis was correlated with increased cell survival (BCL2 protein levels) and cell proliferation (PCNA protein levels) in the utero-embryonic unit, suggesting an indirect effect of adiponectin via estradiol synthesis by the ovary. An in vitro study further confirmed the in vivo findings that adiponectin treatment increases PCNA levels together with increased uptake of glucose by increasing the abundance of glucose transporter 8 (GLUT8) in the utero-embryonic unit. The in vitro study also revealed that adiponectin, together with estradiol but not alone, significantly increased ADIPOR1 protein levels. Thus, adiponectin works in concert with estradiol to increase glucose transport to the uteroembryonic unit and promote cell proliferation, which together accelerate embryonic development.",

            "abstractNote": "Cynopterus sphinx\n                , a fruit bat, undergoes delayed embryonic development during the winter months, a period that corresponds to low levels of progesterone and estradiol synthesis by the ovary. Kisspeptins (KPs) are a group of neuropeptide hormones that act via G‐protein coupled receptor 54 (GPR54) to stimulate hypothalamic secretion of Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone, thereby regulating ovarian steroidogenesis, folliculogenesis, and ovulation. GPR54 is also expressed in the ovary, suggesting a direct role for KPs in ovarian steroidogenesis. The aim of present study was to determine if a low serum level of KP is responsible for reduced progesterone and estradiol levels during the period of delayed embryonic development in\n                C. sphinx\n                . Indeed, low serum KP abundance corresponded to reduced expression of GPR54 in ovarian luteal cells during the period of delayed development compared to normal development. In vitro and in vivo treatment with KP increased GPR54 abundance, via Extracellular signal regulated kinase and its downstream mediators, leading to increased progesterone synthesis in the ovary during delayed embryonic development. KP treatment also increased cholesterol uptake and elevated expression of Luteinizing hormone receptor and Steroid acute regulatory protein in the ovary, suggesting that elevation in circulating KP during delayed embryonic development may reactivate luteal activity. KPs may also enhance cell survival (BCL‐2, reduced Caspase 3 activity) and angiogenesis (Vascular endothelium growth factor) during this period. The findings of this study thus demonstrate a regulatory role for KPs in the maintenance of luteal steroidogenesis during pregnancy in\n                C. sphinx\n                .",

The radial, median, ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves were formed by the brachial plexus, which ran to the wing membrane. The two suspected axillary nerves ran to the wing membrane. The radial nerve ran to the end of the first digit, while the median nerve ran along the forearm and subsequently branched-off to run along the second to fifth digits up to the end of the phalanges. The ulnar nerve ran to the plagiopatagium on the extensor side of the elbow joint. Finally, the musculocutaneous nerve passed through the ventral side of the humerus and branched out at the elbow joint to run radially to the propatagium area. In this study, the visible nerves that were distributed from the upper arm to the fingertips of Miniopterus fuliginosus were formed by C6–T1.",

The wing membrane was innervated by nerve branches of the radial, ulnar, and median nerves, showing that the membrane was formed from the skin of the forelimb rather than that of the thoracolumbar skin. The radial nerve was mainly composed of the ventral rami of C7–T1, the ulnar nerve by C8–T2, and the median nerve by C8–T1. These components of R. cornutus tended to be from a narrower range of spinal nerves and to position more caudally than those of humans. In addition, the ulnar nerve showed a distribution pattern different from that of other mammals.",

Males of D. panamensis can be distinguished from those of D. halli by the following suite of characters: narrower conscutum, broader basis capituli, shorter dorsal cornua, narrower palpi, palpal segment III tapering to its apex, legs poorly ornate: ivory colored patches present only on dorsal aspects of leg segments (mostly on legs III and IV), and internal spur of coxae I narrower and more tapering. Females of D. panamensis can be distinguished from those of D. halli by the following suite of characters: narrower and less ornate scutum, broader basis capituli, shorter dorsal cornua, larger porose areas, narrower palpi, palpal segment III tapering to its apex, legs poorly ornate: ivory colored patches present only on dorsal aspects of leg segments (mostly on legs III and IV), and internal spur of coxae I narrower and more tapering. Nymphs of D. panamensis can be distinguished from those of D. halli by clear posterolateral projections of scutum and by absence of coxal “pore” on coxae IÐIV, while larvae of D. panamensis can be distinguished from those of D. halli by shorter and less sharp lateral projections of basis capituli dorsally and slightly sharp anterior angle of basis capituli. D. panamensis is known from highlands of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama where the adults were collected from porcupines and unidentiÞed sloth and mouse while nymphs and larvae were found on various rodents and a bat.",

            "abstractNote": "Although based on very limited M and L segment sequences, Artybash virus (ARTV) was proposed previously as a unique hantavirus harbored by the Laxmann’s shrew (Sorex caecutiens). To verify this conjecture, lung tissues from 68 Laxmann’s shrews, captured during 2006 to 2014 in eastern Siberia, Russia, and Hokkaido, Japan, were analyzed for ARTV RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ARTV RNA was detected in six Laxmann’s shrews. Pairwise alignment and comparison of partial- and full-length S, M, and L segment sequences from these Laxmann’s shrews, as well as phylogenetic analyses, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods indicated that ARTV was distinct from other soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses and representative hantaviruses harbored by rodents, moles, and bats. Taxonomic identity of the ARTVinfected Laxmann’s shrews was conﬁrmed by full-length cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis. Our data indicate that the hantavirus previously known as Amga virus (MGAV) represents genetic variants of ARTV. Thus, the previously proposed designation of ARTV/MGAV should be replaced by ARTV.",

We investigated the reproductive activity of the vespertilionid bat yellowish myotis, Myotis levis, from a highland area in Southeastern Brazil. The data were obtained through histological analyses of the male and female genital systems from February 2010 to May 2011. The testes of the adult yellowish myotis showed seasonal morphological characteristics which were categorized in the following stages: rest, maturing, mature, and mating. Rest and maturing males were recorded throughout the rainy season (October-March). In the rest stage no spermatogenesis was observed and the epididymal duct was devoid of spermatozoa. Maturing individuals had started spermatogenesis and few spermatozoa were found in the epididymal duct. Mature males were found toward the end (February-March) of the rainy season, when full spermatogenic activity was recorded and spermatozoa were packed in the epididymal duct. Although not recorded, mating probably occurred in the middle of the dry season (April–September) when the cauda epididymis was enlarged and packed with sperm. The spermatozoa remained stored in the cauda epididymis for at least three months when the testes entered into regression. The ovaries showed all types of ovarian follicles throughout the study period except mature follicles which were registered only in July (mid-dry season). Lactating females were captured in the beginning of the rainy season. The seasonal reproductive characteristics of the yellowish myotis from this Neotropical highland area were similar those of epididymal sperm-storing temperate vespertilionids. J.

            "abstractNote": "Establishing the putative links between sylvatic and domestic transmission cycles of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, is of public health relevance. We conducted three surveys to assess T. cruzi infection in wild mammals from a rural and a preserved area in Misiones Province, Northeastern Argentina, which had recently been declared free of vector- and blood-borne transmission of human T. cruzi infection. A total of 200 wild mammals were examined by xenodiagnosis (XD) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcation of the hyper-variable region of kinetoplast DNA minicircles of T. cruzi (kDNA-PCR). The overall prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 8%. Nine (16%) of 57 Didelphis albiventris opossums and two (7%) of 29 Desmodus rotundus vampire bats were positive by both XD and kDNA-PCR. Additionally, one D. rotundus positive for T. cruzi by kDNA-PCR tested positive by satelliteDNA-PCR (SAT-DNA-PCR). The T. cruzi-infected bats were captured indoors and in the yard of a vacant dwelling. All D. albiventris were infected with TcI and both XD-positive D. rotundus by TcII. Fifty-ﬁve opossum cubs within the marsupium were negative by XD. The mean infectiousness to the vector was 62% in D. albiventris and 50% in D. rotundus. Mice experimentally infected with a parasite isolate from a vampire bat displayed lesions typically caused by T. cruzi. Our study documents the presence of the genotype TcII in a sylvatic host for the ﬁrst time in Argentina, and the occurrence of two transmission cycles of T. cruzi in a district free of domestic vector-borne transmission.",

            "abstractNote": "The history of Western Cape mammalogy began almost 200 years ago with Thunberg (1811) and has been augmented periodically ever since. The present paper follows Vernon (1972) and Grindley et al. (1973) in eliciting information from material in Barn owl Tyto alba (Scopoli) pellets. Analyses are based on identified and counted mandibles and maxillae. The Laminate vlei rat, Otomys laminatus Thomas and Schwann, and Krebs’s fat mouse, Steatomys krebsii Peters, are shown to have wider distributions than were previously recorded. The Southern multimammate mouse, Mastomys coucha (A. Smith), is apparently expanding its range westwards, a move probably enabled by changes in vegetation due to farming practices. There appears to be some correspondence between proportional representation of some species and rainfall, either its amount per annum or its seasonality. Variation in alveolar length in Cape gerbils, Tatera afra (Gray), taken as a proxy for mean individual mass, suggests that mean size in this species may be influenced by rainfall seasonality. Although the Vlei rat, Otomys irroratus (Brants), is known to breed throughout the year, the present evidence indicates that in the West Coast National Park births peak in late spring and early summer, some two months after maximum rainfall. The Western Cape data support the concept that T. alba is a selective opportunist. Sample structure and co-occurrence of species in individual pellets both show that in some cases the owls are more nearly opportunistic while in others they appear to be considerably more selective.",

            "abstractNote": "Inga species are characterised by generalist or mixed pollination system. However, this feature does not enhance reproductive rates in species with very low fruit set under natural conditions. Some ecological and genetic factors are associated with this feature, and to test the effect of massive visits on pollination success in Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana, we studied the efﬁcacy of polyads deposited on stigmas of ﬂowers isolated from visitors and polyads exposed to visitors. The proportion of polyads ﬁxed in stigmas decreased after exposure to visitors (24 h) in comparison to stigmas isolated from visitors (hummingbirds, bees, wasps, hawkmoths and bats), and fruit set was very low. Furthermore, nectar production, sugar composition and other ﬂoral biology traits were evaluated. Increased nectar production, sugar availability and sucrose dominance during the night indicates adaptation to nocturnal visitors and supports their role as main pollinators; although the brush-ﬂower morphology, time of anthesis, nectar dynamics and chemical composition also allow daytime visitors. Thus the species is an important resource for a diverse group of ﬂoral visitors. We conclude that excess visits (diurnal and nocturnal) are responsible for the decrease in ﬁxed polyads in stigmas of I. subnuda subsp. luschnathiana ﬂowers, thus contributing, with others factors, to its low fruit set. Therefore, the generalist pollination system does not result in reproductive advantages because the low fruit set in natural conditions could be the result of a negative effect of visitors/pollinators.",

            "abstractNote": "Various studies address the morphology of the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of insectivorous bat species. However, detailed morphometric studies including mucin histochemistry are scarce. This study compares various GIT measurements as well as the quantification of intestinal mucin secreting cells in four insectivorous bat species representing four different families of Chiroptera. Alcian blue/Periodic acid Schiff's stain was used to differentiate between acid and neutral mucin-secreting cells while the Aldehyde fuchsin/Alcian blue stain further differentiated between two acid mucins, namely sialo-, and sulphomucins. The number of cells was quantified and statistically analysed. All species had a simple GIT morphology represented by a simple, completely glandular stomach and the absence of a cecum. The exception was R. hardwickii, where a small cecum was observed which had histological mucosal features of both the small and large intestine. In R.hardwickii, distal to the cecum, typical colonic mucosal features such as the absence of villi and an abundance of goblet cells were observed. In all four species, the total number of goblet cells increased from the proximal to the distal intestinal regions. Mixed (acid and neutral) mucins dominated the entire GIT of all species. Neutral mucin-secreting cells were observed in the gastric pylorus and proximal intestinal regions in all species. Brunner's glands stained positive for neutral mucins. Exclusively acid mucin-secreting cells were seen in the distal intestinal regions of all species except N. thebaica. Sulphomucin-secreting cells were the most prominent acid mucin cell-type towards the distal intestine. The distribution of different mucin secreting cells indirectly provides information regarding the quality of the intestinal biofilm in the species studied.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat paramyxoviruses (PmV) are a diverse group of viruses and include zoonotic viruses such as henipaviruses. Members of this group in other continents have been associated with severe respiratory and neurological infections in animals and humans. Furthermore, despite the richness of diverse bat species that can transmit this virus in African countries like Nigeria, there is very scanty information as to the presence and co-­evolution of paramyxoviruses in bats. There is a need for continuous surveillance of zoonotic viruses and their biological reservoirs as this will help in the prevention and management of pathogens' spillovers. This study detected novel paramyxoviruses in Chaerephon nigeriae bat species found in Badagry, Lagos. Phylogenetic analyses of paramyxovirus sequences' co-­evolution with frugivorous and insectivorous bats circulating in African countries were also performed using sequences of African origin available in the Database of Bat-­Associated Viruses (DBatVir: http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ DBatVir/). Oral swabs (n = 18) and blood samples (n = 32) were collected from C. nigeriae bats in Badagry, Lagos. The L gene of bat paramyxovirus was detected in all oral swabs using PCR techniques. Six of the amplicons were successfully sequenced. Estimated phylogenies placed the sequences in close relationship with those isolated from insectivorous bats. Phylogenetic analyses of previously sequenced isolates in the African region showed the likelihood of different co-­evolution mechanisms of paramyxoviruses with frugivorous bats compared with insectivorous bats. This may be due to codon usage bias of the L gene. Spatial distribution of paramyxoviruses in African countries showed limited ongoing surveillance of this virus in the continent, especially in southern and northern countries. Extensive surveillance of paramyxoviruses with possible zoonotic potentials among bat species in the continent is recommended. This will provide further insights into co-­evolution as well as prevent possible spillover into the human population.",

            "abstractNote": "The Brazilian free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis (Saint-Hilaire, 1824), uses calls that represent a broad continuum of design variation which is dependent upon habitat and situation, and exhibits characteristic changes in call design as bats close in on airborne targets. Here we demonstrate the influence of conspecifics on call design. We found that the peak frequency used in calls varies more as the number of bats flying in the same space increases (measured from single bats and pairs of bats). We investigated this phenomenon through comparing call-parameter differences found between two bats recorded flying together (actual pairs) with call-parameter differences between two bats each recorded flying alone at different locations that were randomly assigned to one another (virtual pairs). We found that actual pairs of bats used calls which differed in peak frequency more so than did virtual pairs. This result is particularly striking given that these frequency differences were greater between bats in the same space than between bats in two different habitats. We argue that these differences indicate that this species is practicing jamming avoidance, air traffic control, or both.",

The search for effective biological control agents targeting P. destructans is of great importance. We report that the sesquiterpene trans, trans-farnesol, which is also a Candida albicans quorum sensing compound, prevented in vitro conidial germination for at least 14 days and inhibited growth of preexisting hyphae of five P. destructans isolates in filtered potato dextrose broth at 10 °C. Depending on the inoculation concentrations, both spore and hyphal inhibition occurred upon exposure to concentrations as low as 15–20 lM trans, trans-farnesol. In contrast, most North American Pseudogymnoascus isolates were more tolerant to the exposure of trans, trans-farnesol. Our results suggest that some Candida isolates may have the potential to inhibit the growth of P. destructans and that the sesquiterpene trans, trans-farnesol has the potential to be utilized as a biological control agent.",

            "abstractNote": "The hindlimbs in bats are functionally adapted to serve as a hook to attach to the mother from birth, and to roost during independent life. Although bats exhibit different terrestrial locomotion capabilities involving hindlimbs, hindlimb morphology and postnatal development have been poorly studied. We describe in detail the postnatal development and bone morphology of hindlimbs of the nimble walker vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, and compare adult characters with the insectivorous Molossus molossus (erratic walker) and the frugivorous Artibeus lituratus (non-walker). The advanced ossification of most hindlimb elements of D. rotundus at the newborn stage is consistent with the functional role of this structure at birth in bats. The development completion events of hindlimb bone elements and bone processes in D. rotundus coincide with the cranial bone processes completion and suture closure events. Those events occur when individuals begin to feed by themselves. There are differences in the number and position of bone processes and sesamoids in adults among the compared species, most of which are described for the first time, and in the case of D. rotundus and M. molossus mostly related to a greater and tight articulation between elements. These facts seem to be closely associated with the different terrestrial locomotion capabilities, and in the case of the exclusively sanguivorous D. rotundus with specializations for obtaining food.

In each locality, 18 bat boxes of both models were observed. The groups of three boxes were erected on separate trees. The rate of occupancy of standard boxes by Nathusius’ bats was found to be nearly six times higher than that of flat boxes. The absolute majority of bats used both models during the nursery and autumn migration season. Standard boxes were used by Nathusius’ pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus), pond bat (Myotis dasycneme), brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and noctule (Nyctalus noctula), whereas flat boxes were used only by Nathusius’ pipistrelle and pond bat.",

When echolocating in acoustically enriched environments, bats show many adaptations that are believed to facilitate signal extraction. Most studies to date focused on describing adaptations in insectivorous bats while frugivorous bats have rarely been tested. Here, we characterize how the frugivorous bat Carollia perspicillata adapts its echolocation behavior in response to acoustic playback. Since bats not only adapt their echolocation calls in response to acoustic interference but also with respect to target distances, we swung bats on a pendulum to control for distance-dependent call changes. Forward swings evoked consistent echolocation behavior similar to approach flights. By comparing the echolocation behavior recorded in the presence and absence of acoustic playback, we could precisely define the influence of the acoustic context on the bats’ vocal behavior. Our results show that C. perspicillata decrease the terminal peak frequencies of their calls when echolocating in the presence of acoustic playback. When considering the results at an individual level, it became clear that each bat dynamically adjusts different echolocation parameters across and even within experimental days. Utilizing such dynamics, bats create unique echolocation streams that could facilitate signal extraction in noisy environments.",

To identify features that may determine roost selection by M. myotis, we compared a range of structural and habitat variables for 17 maternity roosts and 17 unoccupied, but potentially suitable, buildings in the Moravian Karst (Czech Republic). Roosts and control sites were mainly in churches and chateaus and all were detached from the surrounding buildings and uninsulated. The only difference between habitat surrounding roost and control buildings was that roost buildings had relatively lower amounts of hedges as linear connective features. Our results suggest that bats do not select building features from among suitable detached and uninsulated churches and chateaus and that bats tend to select building roosts that are not connected to woodland by hedges. Protection of roosts is an important conservation issue for female M. myotis and suitable roost sites such as detached and uninsulated buildings that are not connected to woodland by hedges are important maternity roosting resources.",

Morphological, ecological and previous genetic evidences supported the view that the two species constitute two well-differentiated groups, but recent phylogenetic analyses have shown that the two species shared some mtDNA haplotypes when they occurred in sympatry. In order to see whether some genetic exchange occurred between the two species, we sequenced a highly variable segment of the mitochondrial control region in both species living in sympatry and in allopatry. We also analysed the nuclear diversity of 160 individuals of both species found in two mixed nursery colonies located north and south of the Alps. MtDNA analysis confirmed that European\n              M. blythii\n              share multiple, identical or very similar haplotypes with\n              M. myotis\n              . Since allopatric Asian\n              M. blythii\n              presents mtDNA sequences that are very divergent from those of the two species found in Europe, we postulate that the mitochondrial genome of the European\n              M. blythii\n              has been replaced by that of\n              M. myotis\n              . The analysis of nuclear diversity shows a strikingly different pattern, as both species are well differentiated within mixed nursery colonies (\n              F\n              ST\n              =0.18). However, a Bayesian analysis of admixture reveals that the hybrids can be frequently observed, as about 25% of sampled\n              M. blythii\n              show introgressed genes of\n              M. myotis\n              origin. Contrastingly, less than 4% of the\n              M. myotis\n              analysed were classified as non-parental genotypes, revealing an asymmetry in the pattern of hybridization between the two species. These results show that the two species can interbreed and that the hybridization is still ongoing in the areas of sympatry. The persistence of well-differentiated nuclear gene pools, in spite of an apparent replacement of mitochondrial genome in European\n              M. blythii\n              by that of\n              M. myotis\n              , is best explained by a series of introgression events having occurred repeatedly during the recent colonization of Europe by\n              M. blythii\n              from Asia. The sharp contrast obtained from the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers further points to the need to cautiously interpret results based on a single class of genetic markers.",

A few individual species have evolved mutualistic relationships with small mammals that visit the traps to harvest nectar, and in return leave faecal droppings in the pitchers. Here we report that a diverse guild of nectar-harvesting vertebrates visits pitchers of two common lowland Nepenthes species without providing any obvious beneﬁt for the plants. Over four consecutive ﬁeld seasons, we observed four species of sunbirds and one species of tree shrew drinking nectar from pitcher plants. Foraging activity was highest in the morning and late afternoon. Van Hasselt’s, Brown-throated and olive-backed sunbirds were regular and highly abundant pitcher visitors in two diﬀerent ﬁeld sites. A crimson sunbird and a lesser tree shrew were each observed harvesting nectar on one occasion. The vertebrates harvested nectar from the pitcher rim (peristome) of N. raﬄesiana and from the underside of the pitcher lid of N. gracilis. A comparison of the nectar production of these and three further sympatric species revealed exceptionally high quantities of nectar for N. raﬄesiana. Other factors such as plant and pitcher abundance and the habitat preferences of the observed vertebrates are likely to also play a role in their choice to visit particular species. This is the ﬁrst account of a case of obvious nectar robbing from Nepenthes pitchers by a guild of species that are too large to serve as prey, while the pitcher size and shape prevent faecal droppings from reaching the pitcher’s inside. This interaction provides an example of a possible starting point for the evolution of the elaborate mutualistic relationships observed in some species. Follow-up adaptations of pitcher shape could enable the plants to catch the droppings of their visitors and turn an exploitative relationship into a mutualism.",

The perches were located along the Zambezi River in Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe. With the exception of an occasional solifugid, N. grandis ate mainly insects in addition to frogs and other small vertebrates. Three species of katydids and many species of moths were the most common prey. While bats using one feeding perch fed heavily on two species of cicadas at times, those at the other perches rarely did. There also were differences in the incidences of antlions, mantids and beetles in the diets of bats using different perches. Extensive samples from two feeding roosts about 2 km apart showed significant differences in prey composition. Smaller samples from two sites closer to one another showed similar patterns of the incidence of different prey.",

When echolocating in acoustically enriched environments, bats show many adaptations that are believed to facilitate signal extraction. Most studies to date focused on describing adaptations in insectivorous bats while frugivorous bats have rarely been tested. Here, we characterize how the frugivorous bat Carollia perspicillata adapts its echolocation behavior in response to acoustic playback. Since bats not only adapt their echolocation calls in response to acoustic interference but also with respect to target distances, we swung bats on a pendulum to control for distance-dependent call changes. Forward swings evoked consistent echolocation behavior similar to approach flights. By comparing the echolocation behavior recorded in the presence and absence of acoustic playback, we could precisely define the influence of the acoustic context on the bats’ vocal behavior. Our results show that C. perspicillata decrease the terminal peak frequencies of their calls when echolocating in the presence of acoustic playback. When considering the results at an individual level, it became clear that each bat dynamically adjusts different echolocation parameters across and even within experimental days. Utilizing such dynamics, bats create unique echolocation streams that could facilitate signal extraction in noisy environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Integrating different lines of evidence is currently recognized as the most robust approach to investigating taxonomic questions, particularly those concerning cryptic diversity. In recent years, different sources of evidence have pointed to new cryptic taxa for bats, with the genus Hsunycteris being an excellent study group because of its large karyotypic variability and high genetic divergence revealed by the latest taxonomic and systematic reviews. This study tests the cryptic diversity hypothesis for the Hsunycteris thomasi complex through an integrative approach using species delimitation, phylogenetic analysis, chromosome painting, and linear morphometry. Our results suggest the existence of three lineages for H. thomasi that are morphologically indistinguishable, confirming the two previously described lineages in the literature and adding a third. We argue that the paraphyly in H. thomasi, as reported by previous studies, should be treated as independent species since they have unique evolutionary histories. Finally, we demonstrate that chromosomal and molecular methods are indispensable for recognizing and confirming groups that include cryptic species or species with confusing and controversial taxonomy.",

These bats are known only from a narrow belt of the Mediterranean zone in Maghreb and from NE Libya. We analysed museum specimens of African populations of P. pipistrellus s.l. using both morphologic and genetic techniques and compared them with Eurasian specimens of the complex. The African representatives of P. pipistrellus complex include two morphologically, genetically and geographically distinct populations. One of them inhabits the Mediterranean part of Cyrenaica, Libya. Belonging to the P. pygmaeus genetic lineage, these bats are represented by larger and more rusty coloured individuals with large massive rostrum and canines. In morphologic traits, this population differs significantly from all Western Palaearctic populations of the P. pipistrellus complex. These bats differ by about 6–7% in genetic distance from P. pygmaeus s. str. Within the P. pygmaeus lineage Libyan bats seem to be unique in their echolocation calls: the maximum energy of terminal frequencies was recorded at about 45 kHz. We consider the Libyan pipistrelles to represent a separate species, Pipistrellus hanaki sp. nov. Another distinct African pipistrelle population inhabits the Mediterranean parts of NW African countries, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Individuals from the latter population are small and somewhat darker members of the P. pipistrellus genetic lineage, with relatively short and narrow mesial part of rostrum. Although both morphological and genetic differences between this population and Eurasian P. pipistrellus s. str. were found (genetic distance about 3–5%), they are probably not sufficient for the separation of this form at the specific level. However, the differences from European samples show rather not a cline character and therefore potential subspecific level of NW African P. pipistrellus has to be taken into consideration.",

Additionally, we performed a species distribution modelling (SDM) analysis to explore its potential distribution in North Africa. The final SDM depicted a relatively wellknown distribution and predicted that the suitable bioclimatic areas for this species are essentially found within the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome.",

            "abstractNote": "Small insectivorous bats often enter a state of torpor, a controlled, reversible decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate. Torpor provides substantial energy savings and is used more extensively during periods of low temperature and reduced prey availability. We studied torpor use and activity of a small (10.1 ± 0.4 g) fishing bat, Myotis macropus, during winter in a mild climate in Australia. We predicted that the thermal stability of water would make foraging opportunities in winter more productive and consistent in a riparian habitat compared to a woodland habitat, and therefore, fishing bats would use torpor less than expected during winter compared to other bats. Using temperature-sensitive radio transmitters, we recorded the skin temperature of 12 adult (6 M, 6 F) bats over 161 bat-days (13.4 ± 5.4 days per bat) during Austral winter (late May to August), when daily air temperature averaged 6.2–18.2°C. Bats used torpor every day, with bouts lasting a median of 21.3 h and up to 144.6 h. Multiday torpor bouts were more common in females than males. Arousals occurred just after sunset and lasted 3.5 ± 2.9 h. Arousals tended to be longer in males than females and to occur on warmer evenings, suggesting some winter foraging and perhaps male harem territoriality or other mating-related activity was occurring. The extensive use of torpor by M. macropus during relatively mild winter conditions when food is likely available suggests torpor might function to minimize the risks of mortality caused by activity and to increase body condition for the upcoming breeding season.",

These pups (n = 11) died over an 11-day period and were submitted to a government laboratory for testing where ABLV infection was confirmed. Over the next several weeks, additional ABLV cases in flying foxes in Queensland were also detected. Brain tissue from ABLV-infected flying foxes during this period, as well as archived brain tissue, was selected for next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the two groups of pups were each infected from single sources. They were likely exposed while in crèche at night as their dams foraged. This study identifies crèche-age pups at a potentially heightened risk for mass ABLV infection.",

The host specimen, a little known molossid bat (Myopterus whitleyi), constitutes the first record of this species in CAR. The new flea species appears taxonomically close to A. hetera Beaucournu & Fain, 1982, one of the two other Allopsylla species, previously know from other faunal regions (A. alloides in Nigeria and A. hetera in Democratic Republic of the Congo). The parasitism of three distinctly different hosts by the three known Allopsylla species raises questions regarding the hostparasite specificity of this group.",

Echolocation signals were recorded in the ﬁeld in south-eastern Moravia and northern Bohemia (Czech Republic) and in an ad hoc experimental laboratory. For each of the species, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated signiﬁcant differences in calls produced inside the experimental room and in the open. Paired t-tests and MANOVA were also used to reveal inﬂuences of interindividual contacts in each of the cryptic species on the spectral patterns of call variables. Differences were found in the spectral variables of echolocation calls of an individual ﬂying in the room alone and in a group of conspeciﬁcs. The possibility that bats use their ﬂexibility to avoid mutual disturbances of echolocation calls was tested. We found that bats ﬂying in a group modify the parameters of their echolocation signals according to the presence of other individuals of the same species. These differences can indicate jamming avoidance and recognition of own echoes. However, they did not change the parameters if individuals of another species were present. Social calls are more numerous when bats ﬂy in a mixedspecies group than in a monospeciﬁc group.",

The phenology of display and swarming behaviour were studied using bat detectors and mist nettings in the ruins of Nový Hrádek castle (southwestern Moravia, Czech Republic), where P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus hibernate in mixed-species clusters. We hypothesize that if both pipistrelle species share the same swarming site and hibernaculum they can compete with each other and their mating and courtship activity can be separate over time. The highest songflight activity was found between mid-August and mid-September. At the beginning of the mating period, songflights of both species were recorded in the second third of the night, whereas from the end of September, the peak of display activity moved to the first third of the night. We did not find clear evidence for temporal niche partitioning between species during autumn mating behaviour at locality of study. Proportion of P. pygmaeus observed in the hibernaculum was significantly higher than its observed in acoustic recordings and in mist-netted bats. It may show different mating behaviour between both pipistrelle species. Males of P. pipistrellus produced display calls close to hibernacula, whereas males of P. pygmaeus probably mate elsewhere, likely before any long autumnal migration near nursery colonies.",

This data extends its distribution range in Central Europe and confirms it as a native breeding species in Poland. Specific identification of bats was confirmed by sequencing ND1 gene of mtDNA. In Poland its reproduction has been recorded in Łężczok reserve, Silesian Foothill and in Roztocze National Park. Bats were observed mostly within old broadleaved and mixed forests, near water, at altitude ranging from 112 to 736 m a.s.l. The only known roosting site for the species is a cave which is used both in spring and during the swarming period. In Poland the species co-occurred with both M. brandtii and M. mystacinus or with M. brandtii at all sites.",

Bats have a long-standing reputation for being highly sensitive to stressors, with sensitivity and resilience varying both within and among species, yet little is known about how stress affects the signaling that regulates reproductive physiology. Here, we provide the first description of the molecular response of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis of male big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in response to short-term stress using a standardized restraint manipulation. This acute stressor was sufficient to upregulate plasma corticosterone and resulted in a rapid decrease in circulating testosterone. While we did not find differences in the mRNA expression of key steroidogenic enzymes (StAR, aromatase, 5-alpha reductase), seminiferous tubule diameter was reduced in stressed bats coupled with a 5-fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression in the testes. These changes, in part, may be mediated by RFamide-related peptide (RFRP) because fewer immunoreactive cell bodies were detected in the brains of stressed bats compared with controls – suggesting a possible increase in secretion – and increased RFRP expression locally in the gonads. The rapid sensitivity of the bat testes to stress may be connected to deleterious impacts on tissue health and function as supported by significant transcriptional upregulation of key pro-apoptotic signaling molecules (Bax, cytochrome c). Experiments like this broadly contribute to our understanding of the stronger ecological predictions regarding physiological responses of bats within the context of stress, which may impact decisions surrounding animal handling and conservation approaches.",

            "abstractNote": "In Argentina, the study of feeding habits of bats was practically restricted to frugivorous species, whereas data on the insectivorous bat diet was scarce and anecdotal. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the diet of Tadarida brasiliensis along the Yungas Forest, Argentina, at sites with different degrees of disturbance. Through the analysis of feces, arthropod orders were identified, volume and frequency of occurrence were estimated for each food item, and the niche breadth was estimated for the species. Finally, the diet was compared between capture sites, sexes, and seasons; finding variations among sites and seasons. The diet of T. brasiliensis contains arthropods belonging to nine orders and one undetermined taxon. Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera represent the highest volume proportions in the diet. The results add new and important information about the biology of T. brasiliensis in the southern part of its distribution.",

            "abstractNote": "The vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a haematophagous animal that feeds exclusively on the blood of domestic mammals. Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RTPCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.",

            "abstractNote": "The organophosphorous (OP) pesticide fenthion is widely used in commercial fruit industry and orchards in South America. Among the metabolic effects in mammals caused by fenthion, hyperglycemia occurs via the activation of hepatic metabolic pathways, which may interfere with the function of several organs and systems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute and sub-chronic levels of fenthion on energy metabolism and liver morphology of frugivorous bats (Artibeus lituratus), which usually feed on fruits cultivated on South American plantations where fenthion is used. Animals were fed fruit treated with fenthion by immersion of fruit in a solution containing fenthion (500 ppm) and an adhesive spreader (200 ppm). Blood glucose levels did not change due to fenthion treatment, but muscle glycogen content increased and carcass fatty acids decreased after acute exposure. An increase in hepatocyte cell diameter further characterized as an increase in vacuolization was observed. The results indicate that fenthion may affect some components of energy metabolism and promote alterations in hepatocyte morphology in frugivorous bats when applied to cultivated fruits at the recommended rates.",

            "abstractNote": "Resource selection by animals inﬂuences ecological processes such as dispersal, reproduction, foraging, and migration. Little information exists regarding foraging resource selection by bats during the maternity season. We evaluated support for effects of landcover type, landform, and landscape pattern on resource selection by individual foraging female eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) during the maternity period and compared resource utilization for all individuals pooled (population level), individuals grouped by geographic location, and individuals grouped by stage of lactation (early, mid, and late). We used a resource utilization function (RUF) to relate landcover and landscape attributes to the utilization distributions of individual bats estimated by the ﬁxed-kernel method. We radio-tracked 64 lactating red bats and estimated utilization distributions for 52 individuals. Mean home range size ranged from 1,041 to 1,588 ha from late to mid lactation. The global RUF model was signiﬁcantly better than the null RUF model for 36 (70%) individuals and the magnitude and direction of coefﬁcients varied among individuals. Resource utilization at the population level was, on average, positively related to ridges and upland drainage landforms, water landcover, and road density; and negatively related to urban and nonforest landcover and distance to edge. Resource use differed between geographic areas by canopy cover, water landcover, and road density. Canopy closure was positively related to RUF in both areas but was greater in the south area. Percent water negatively related to RUF in the north area and positively related in the south area. Road density had a positive relationship in the north and negative relationship in the south with RUF. We did not ﬁnd a difference in mean RUF coefﬁcients among lactation groups except for canopy cover. On average, canopy cover had a positive effect on use by bats during early and mid-lactation but a negative effect during late lactation. We suggest that management for red bats consider landscape components and provide a range of composition and structural diversity to enhance foraging use by red bats. In highly forested landscapes, gaps or openings may provide forest edges that are important for foraging and commuting. Published 2014.

            "abstractNote": "The western red bat (Lasiurus blossevillii) is a foliage-roosting species of riparian habitats in arid regions of the southwestern United States. Only limited published anecdotal observations exist for roost sites used by this species. Western red bats were split taxonomically from the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) in 1988, but summaries of roosting behaviors for western red bats still appear to stem from former associations with the commonly studied eastern red bat. Our study represents the first comprehensive research on the roosting ecology of western red bats. We radio-tracked 14 adult bats to 19 different day roosts along the Mimbres River of southwestern New Mexico. While we documented that western red bats had an affinity for densely foliated trees (79%), we did not detect any selection for tree species or size. At our study site, western red bats roosted in cottonwoods (47%, Populus spp.), velvet ash (21%, Fraxinus velutina), box elder (16%, Acer negundo), and red mulberry (16%, Morus rubra). We also described clustering behavior, where groups of 2–3 adults roosted in direct contact with one another. Although the species was deemed to roost solitarily, the frequency of clustering behavior in our study suggests otherwise. If bats were observed in clusters, they typically exhibited greater roosting fidelity than solitary individuals. Because arid riparian corridors in the southwestern United States generally are considered threatened systems, protection and preservation of mechanisms that create and maintain the diversity of these riparian corridors is necessary for the survival of this uncommon and poorly understood species.",

However, discriminant function analysis revealed extensive overlap in call parameters for the different regions. It can be concluded that. although there are differences in some parameters between regions, calls are similar overall in the five geographic regions investigated, and that the slight geographic variation which does occur does not confound the identification of C. gouldii.",

Postnatal growth curves for length of forearm and body mass were determined separately for the different colonies and years. Cooler weather during June 2001 coincided with a median birth date that was 8 days later than in 2000, whilst the difference between colonies was 4 and 5 days, respectively, for the pooled data of both years. Cool temperatures in June also coincided with a longer duration of the parturition period. Postnatal growth rates were higher than in most other bat species but differences between years and colonies were considerable. These differences may be attributed to the ambient roost temperatures, whereby the young of two cooler roosts showed signiﬁcantly reduced growth rate during 8 days of cool weather in 2000. Moreover, later born and therefore smaller pups were more strongly affected by low temperatures than earlier born and larger ones. The mean length of forearm of young lesser horseshoe bats at the beginning of September equalled that of adult bats, whilst their body mass was still lower. Non-volant juveniles did not cluster following the nightly emergence of adult females, and a preferred location within the roosts could not be identiﬁed. High and very low roost temperatures, however, did have an inﬂuence on the location of non-volant young in the colonies.",

Wildlife is often disturbed by these largely unpredictable activities, and animals may have limited opportunities to adapt. Mountain hares\n                    Lepus timidus\n                    are affected by this increase in alpine tourism, but their physiological and behavioural reactions to tourist activity are still unknown.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We measured the levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (\n                    GCM\n                    ) in wild mountain hares living in areas that had no, medium or high levels of tourist activity during winter in 2011. Furthermore, we compared the changes in\n                    GCM\n                    excretion, behaviour and food intake of six captive mountain hares following predator challenge experiments from early to mid‐winter.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Our field results showed that\n                    GCM\n                    excretion is positively correlated with increased tourism intensity. In the predator challenge experiments, hares spent less time resting and grooming (including re‐ingesting faecal pellets) during and after the stress treatments. These stress events lead to higher energy demands due to flushing, increased\n                    GCM\n                    levels, and disrupted the energy intake that hares derive from faeces.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We conclude that mountain hares living in areas with frequent human winter recreational activities show changes in physiology and behaviour that demand additional energy in winter, when access to food resources is limited by snow.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    .
