The species is noted for its long hibernation period with low mortality rate. We investigated the morphology of E. nilssonii blood cells during hibernation, hematological parameters including hemoglobin level, red blood cell (RBC) count, total white blood cell (WBC) count, and differential WBC count. The study revealed changes of several hematological parameters in hibernating bats, with some variation during the hibernation season. Hibernating E. nilssonii were found to have a low total WBC count similar to other hibernators; no significant variation in WBC count was noted during hibernation. Differential leukocyte count showed a significant reduction in total monocytes in winter (in the middle of the hibernation period). Total lymphocyte, band neutrophil, and basophil counts increased in spring (termination of the hibernation period).",

The hypothesis is successful in explaining patterns of testosterone secretion in many avian species, but remains comparatively unexplored in mammals. ‘Circulating plasma testosterone levels (T)’ were studied in relation to harem maintenance in grey-headed flying-foxes,\n              Pteropus poliocephalus\n              . In this species, harems provide mating opportunities and so a male's ability to maintain a harem is likely to correlate with his fitness. We hypothesized that if T reflect a male's ability to withstand challenges from competitors, then T should be linked to successful harem maintenance. To test this, we temporarily removed males from their territories prior to and during the short mating period, recording their harem sizes both before removal and after reintroduction. Most males successfully reclaimed their territory and a harem, but during the mating period, males with higher T had harems closer to their original size, and males with lower T suffered reduction in harem size. Our findings highlight the role of T in harem maintenance in a major mammalian taxon with complex forms of social organization.",

            "abstractNote": "The reproductive beneﬁts of maintaining a high body temperature (Tb) are well understood, but costs may be prohibitively high. Many small mammals raise offspring in insulated nests, burrows, or roosts, and may form communal maternity colonies, all of which are behaviors that reduce the costs of maintaining Tb. However, some temperate-zone bats are solitary and raise young in exposed roosts. Little is known about how these species maintain energy balance in the face of high thermoregulatory costs, and whether they stay warm invariably for reproductive beneﬁts, or use a more adaptive thermoregulatory strategy. We studied Tb patterns in response to foraging conditions, weather, and pup age in free-ranging adult and juvenile hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). Lactating females regularly entered torpor, although its use was most extensive following poor foraging conditions, during inclement weather, and when pups were young. Juvenile L. cinereus appeared capable of staying warm from 3 days of age, but used torpor throughout development, gradually decreasing its use as they grew. Our results indicate that for this species, torpor is important throughout lactation, and torpor use changes in response to individually speciﬁc trade-offs between energetic cost and developmental beneﬁt. We suggest that the costs of active thermoregulation during early development of L. cinereus pups outweigh the beneﬁts of staying warm, and an extended growing season (as a result of their migratory nature) is more conducive to using torpor. Finally, we suggest that torpor use during lactation is dynamic and adaptive. Fine-scale changes within reproductive stages need to be considered, rather than broadly assessing thermoregulatory behavior among stages.",

To clarify the population structure and migration pattern of M. macrodactylus, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeography was investigated in 15 subpopulations along three rivers (Tokachi, Ishikari and Teshio Rivers) on Hokkaido Island, northern Japan. Of 267 bats examined, nine mtDNA cytochrome b haplotypes were identified and separated into two major genetic clades, which did not reflect geographic distributions within and among the river regions. Principal component analysis of mtDNA haplotypes showed that most subpopulations in Ishikari and Teshio of the three river regions were grouped into one genetically related group, whereas those in the Tokachi river region were remotely related to those of the other two river regions. The results could be ascribed to no geographic barriers preventing bats’ migration between the former two river regions. By contrast, it is possible that the Daisetsuzan and Hidaka mountain ranges play a role as effective geographic barriers against migrations of this species between the Tokachi and Ishikari/Teshio river regions.",

            "abstractNote": "Mucuna macrocarpa is a plant found in tropical and subtropical regions that requires an “explosive opening.” Explosive opening is the process that exposes the stamen and pistil from the opening of the carina. This process is needed for cross pollination; however, the plant cannot open itself and opening by an animal is needed. The most common opener of Mucuna ﬂowers is several nectar-eating bats (e.g., Syconycteris), but the ﬂying fox, Pteropus dasymallus, is the only opener of M. macrocarpa on the subtropical island of Okinawajima. Here, we present the explosive openers and possible pollinators in the northernmost and temperate Kamae region, Kyushu, Japan, where nectar-eating bats are absent. The Japanese macaque, Macaca fuscata, and the Japanese marten, Martes melampus, were the explosive openers observed during our survey in Kamae. Martens opened ﬂowers using their snout in a manner similar to that of the ﬂying fox, whereas macaques opened ﬂowers using their hands. This is the ﬁrst time that an animal has been observed opening these ﬂowers with its hands rather than snout. In total, 97% (n = 283) of explosively opened ﬂowers were opened by macaques, and the macaque largely contributed to the overall ﬂower opening. Because many pollen grains become attached to the explosive openers, they are considered to be primary pollinators. Furthermore, two bee species, Apis cerana japonica and Bombus ardens ardens, also visited opened ﬂowers and collected pollen, and they were possibly secondary pollinators.",

C. plicatus has been recorded twice previously, in 1935 and 1997, but a roosting colony has not been recorded before. In May 2016, a colony containing about 300 C. plicatus was observed in a vertical cleft of the rock supporting Sigiriya fortress, a popular historical tourist destination. Four bats were captured during their evening emergence using mist nets. Recording of echolocation calls showed them to be similar to those previously documented for this species in being narrow bandwidth with shallow frequency modulation and low peak frequency (24.9–30.3 kHz), with average call duration of 7.7milliseconds (ms). The forearm length range (45.2–49.1 mm) of captured specimens corresponds to the specimen recorded in 1997 in Sri Lanka and with those recorded in Vietnam and Myanmar. The discovery of a colony of C. plicatus in Sri Lanka provides a basis for future studies of the biology and taxonomy of this species.",

This study focused on a stereotyped behavior of a bat approaching a companion animal in the colony, and examined their interaction and vocalization during this behavior. The bats emit echolocation-like vocalizations when approaching each other and these vocalizations contain a “buildup” pulse sequence, in which the frequency of the pulse increases gradually to normal echolocation pulse frequencies. The results suggest that the echolocation-like pulses serve an important role in communication within the colony.",

Insemination is probably effected several times during proestrous, since both sexes are intermittently active throughout this period (August‐April). Permanent arousal from torpor and return to normal metabolism in the spring results in ovulation. Both ovaries are functional and both uterine horns may be utilized.\n              P. hesperus\n              is monestrous; two young per bat is usual.\n            \n            The male spermatogenic cycle is initiated in late June and the first sperm are available for ejaculation in September. Some sperm remain in the seminiferous tubules until early March. The epididymides also serve in sperm storage with the caput emptied by late February and the cauda in April. Leydig cells are largely nonsecretory from March through July, a few are secretory in August and most are secretory in September and October. Active cells gradually decline in number until few are secretory in late March.\n            Accessory sex glands are functionally cyclic: they are small from April through August, hypertrophy in September, and gradually involute to the resting stage through March, to achieve total involution in April.\n            The penis, similar in structure to that of other vespertilionids, is thought specialized to insure effective insemination.",

For example, the influence of reproductive status, weather, and roost tree and surrounding habitat characteristics on timing of emergence, intra-night activity, and entrance at their roost trees is poorly known. We examined nocturnal activity patterns of northern myotis maternity colonies during pregnancy and lactation at diurnal roost trees situated in areas that were and were not subjected to recent prescribed fires at the Fernow Experimental Forest, West Virginia from 2007 to 2009. According to exit counts and acoustic data, northern myotis colony sizes were similar between reproductive periods and roost tree settings. However, intra-night activity patterns differed slightly between reproductive periods and roost trees in burned and non-burned areas. Weather variables poorly explained variation in activity patterns during pregnancy, but precipitation and temperature were negatively associated with activity patterns during lactation.",

Canonical variate analysis of 14 cranial measurements shows the existence of three distinct nonoverlapping clusters corresponding to (i) M. californicus, (ii) M. I. ciliolabrum and M. I. melanorhinus, and (iii) M. I. leibii. The results of the morphometric analyses do not support the claim that M. I. leibii and M. I. melanorhinus intergrade in Oklahoma. The taxonomic interpretation of the results is that the western forms of M. leibii represent a separate species M. ciliolabrum (Mcrriam). The bacula of the taxa studied lack distinctive characters that would allow one to discriminate between the species of the leibii group.",

            "abstractNote": "Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis with a nearly global distribution. In order to determine the role of bats in the epidemiology of leptospirosis in Nigeria, a total of 231 bats belonging to three families, Pteropodidae (n = 117), Molossidae (n = 107) and Nycteridae (n = 17), roosting in human habitats were screened by PCR and sequencing for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira species. DNA extracted from the kidneys of bats were subjected to conventional PCR targeting the rrs1, rrs2, flaB and secY genes for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. Overall, 27 out of the 231 (11.7%) of the samples screened were positive for Leptospira spp. High prevalence (>80%) of Leptospira spp. DNA was detected in Chaerophon and Nycteris bat species captures in an abandoned well located within a human habitation. Sequences generated in this study were highly identical to Leptospira borgpetersenii and Leptospira interrogans and clustered with sequences of pathogenic species in GenBank. The detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. was significantly associated (p < .001) with the bat species, feeding habit, roosting site and study location. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular detection and characterization of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in bats from Nigeria. Results show that bats in Nigeria are infected with diverse Leptospira genotypes phylogenetically related to known pathogenic, including zoonotic taxa. Together, these findings reinforce bats’ roles as potential reservoirs of Leptospira spp. and should be considered as a starting point for future comparative studies to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of this bacterial pathogen in Nigeria.",

To corroborate decades-old reports of hantaviral antigens in shrews from Russia, archival liver and lung tissues from 4 Siberian large-toothed shrews (Sorex daphaenodon), 5 Eurasian least shrews (Sorex minutissimus), 12 ﬂat-skulled shrews (Sorex roboratus), and 18 tundra shrews (Sorex tundrensis), captured in the Sakha Republic in northeastern Siberia during July and August 2006, were analyzed for hantavirus RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. A novel hantavirus, named Kenkeme virus, was detected in a ﬂat-skulled shrew. Sequence analysis of the full-length S and partial M and L segments indicated that Kenkeme virus was genetically and phylogenetically distinct from Seewis virus harbored by the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), as well as all other rodent-, soricid-, and talpid-borne hantaviruses.",

We provide information on postdispersal seed removal, germination and subsequent recruitment in tropical forest tree species Antiaris toxicaria in Ghana. We tested whether postdispersal seed removal and germination rates were differentially affected by the following seed treatments: seeds that were spat out by monkeys with all fruit pulp removed and spitting seeds with fruit pulp partially removed as observed in some birds and bats. We used seeds of intact ripened fruits as control. Frugivore seed treatment and distance from bole affected seed removal patterns, whereas intact seeds were signiﬁcantly removed from all seed stations. The germination success was greater for seeds that were spat out by monkeys and poor for seeds with fruit pulp partially removed and intact fruits. More recruits were recorded at the edge of the adult A. toxicaria canopy radius. There was weak relationship (r2 = 0.042) between the number of recruits and distance away from the adult tree. Results suggest that the subsequent recruitment in tropical forest tree species may be enhanced by some frugivore fruithandling behaviour where fruit pulp is removed from the seeds without destroying the seeds.",

Seed dispersal enhances germination potential, provides an opportunity for seeds to escape predation under the parent plants, and reduces seedling numbers under parent trees (Şekercioğlu\n              et al\n              . 2004). The way frugivores handle seeds and process them may influence the seed fate of many plants (Janzen 1971). The quantity of seeds dispersed and the quality of dispersal provided by frugivores impact plant fitness (Herrera & Jordano 1981). Schupp (1993) defined the effectiveness of seed dispersal by frugivores as an empirical measure of quantity of seeds dispersed and quality of dispersal from the parent plant to a suitable microsite. Seed dispersal by frugivores increases the chances for seedling survival away from the vicinity of the parent plant because in tropical forests seed predation is concentrated under adult trees that prevent seedlings from establishing near parent trees (Howe & Miriti 2004).",

Nevertheless, Haemosporidia parasite diversity in bats remains largely unstudied. In addition, some cases of unsuccessful PCR amplification of cytochrome\n              b\n              , the most widely used molecular marker to characterize Haemosporidia parasites, have recently been reported for\n              Nycteria\n              parasites infecting Nycteridae bats. Here we used next-generation sequencing to characterize mitochondrial genomes of parasites from the\n              Nycteria\n              genus. Our results have revealed an unsuspected mitochondrial genome rearrangement within Haemosporidia.\n            \n          , \n            \n              Haemosporidia parasites have mostly and abundantly been described using mitochondrial genes, and in particular cytochrome\n              b\n              (\n              cytb\n              ). Failure to amplify the mitochondrial\n              cytb\n              gene of\n              Nycteria\n              parasites isolated from Nycteridae bats has been recently reported. Bats are hosts to a diverse and profuse array of Haemosporidia parasites that remain largely unstudied. There is a need to obtain more molecular data from chiropteran parasites. Such data would help to better understand the evolutionary history of Haemosporidia, which notably include the\n              Plasmodium\n              parasites, malaria’s agents. We use next-generation sequencing to obtain the complete mitochondrial genome of\n              Nycteria\n              parasites from African\n              Nycteris grandis\n              (Nycteridae) and\n              Rhinolophus alcyone\n              (Rhinolophidae) and Asian\n              Megaderma spasma\n              (Megadermatidae). We report four complete mitochondrial genomes, including two rearranged mitochondrial genomes within Haemosporidia. Our results open outlooks into potentially undiscovered Haemosporidian diversity.",

Fossils of Myotis from Bat Cave, KY, were studied in an attempt to identify these specimens to species level. Southeastern Bats and endangered Indiana Bats dominated the fossil sample, with some Eastern Small-footed Bats and endangered Gray Bats. Such results demonstrate the ability to differentiate Myotis from historic and prehistoric sites and provide a tool for researchers to understand and potentially to conserve these species.",

The difficulties of resolving various problems with historical specimens are explored and several examples are provided, including the contentious origin and identification of a southeastern myotis, Myotis austroriparius (Rhoads, 1897) (NHMUK 1837.4.8.127). Information about type specimens is discussed and the geographical position of several type localities of rodents and a mustelid in the Rocky Mountains and a lagomorph in the USA are refined.",

Primary sex function, such as spermatogenesis, may also benefit from immune down-regulation since spermatozoa are not recognised as self by the immune system. Males with greater parasite resistance should therefore be able to experience higher androgens levels with a resultant increase in spermatogenic investment and ejaculate quality, plus greater suppression of the immune system. We investigate this possibility in two species of Australian bat. Testis size was used as a measure of ejaculate investment and quality, and spleen size was used as an indicator of immune function. Significant negative relationships were found between spleen and testis mass in one species and a negative trend was noted in a second. When the overall effect size was calculated, the negative association across both species was statistically significant. Our results are consistent with the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis since males able to withstand greater immune system down-regulation had larger testes.",

            "abstractNote": "The hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex are crucially involved in learning and memory as well as in spatial navigation. The conservation of these structures across the entire mammalian lineage demonstrates their importance. Information on a diverse set of spatially tuned neurons has become available, but we only have a rudimentary understanding of how anatomical network structure affects functional tuning. Bats are the only order of mammals that have evolved true flight, and with this specialization comes the need to navigate and behave in a three dimensional (3D) environment. Spatial tuning of cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal network of bats has been studied for some time, but whether the reported tuning in 3D is associated with changes in the entorhinal-hippocampal network is not known. Here we investigated the entorhinal-hippocampal projections in the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), by injecting chemical anterograde tracers in the entorhinal cortex. Detailed analyses of the terminations of these projections in the hippocampus showed that both the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex sent projections to the molecular layer of all subfields of the hippocampal formation. Our analyses showed that the terminal distributions of entorhinal fibers in the hippocampal formation of Egyptian fruit bats—including the proximo-distal and longitudinal topography and the layer-specificity—are similar to what has been described in other mammalian species such as rodents and primates. The major difference in entorhinal-hippocampal projections that was described to date between rodents and primates is in the terminal distribution of the DG projection. We found that bats have entorhinal-DG projections that seem more like those in primates than in rodents. It is likely that the latter projection in bats is specialized to the behavioral needs of this species, including 3D flight and long-distance navigation.",

Here we present the complete mitogenome of Geoffroy’s rousette, Rousettus amplexicaudatus found in Peninsular Malaysia . The mitogenome constructed is 16,511bp in length containing 37 genes; 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and a D-loop region. The overall base composition is estimated to be 32.28% for A, 25.64% for T, 14.09% for G and 27.98% for C, indicating a slightly AT rich feature (57.93%). A phylogenetic and BLASTn analysis against other available mitogenomes showed Malaysian R. amplexicaudatus matched 98% similarity to the same species in Cambodia and Vietnam. However, it differed considerably (92.53% similarity) with the same species in the Philippines. This suggests flexibility in Rousettus sp. with regards to adapting to mesic and dry habitats, ability for long-distance dispersal and remarkably precise lingual echolocation thus supporting its widerange distribution and colonization. Further taxonomical and mitogenomic comparatives are required in resolving the evolutionary relationship between Rousettus spp.",

Three different chromosomal races have been described in this species: a 2n = 42 race from South America east of the Andes, a 2n = 44 from NW Central America and 2n = 38 from the rest of Central America and NW South America. The deepest nodes in the tree were found within the South American race (42 race), which is consistent with a longer history of this race. Average distance among races ranged from 2.5 to 2.9%, with the highest amount of intraracial variation found within the 2n = 42 race (1.7%), intermediate values within the 2n = 38 race (0.9%) and lowest within the 2n = 44 race (0.5%). Variation among chromosomal races accounted for over 55% of molecular variance, whereas variation among populations within races accounted for 6%. The 2n = 38 and 2n = 44 races hybridize in the coastal lowlands of Honduras, near the Gulf of Fonseca. Introgression between these two races is low (two introgressed individuals in 45 examined). Clinal variation across the hybrid zone for the cytochrome-b of U. bilobatum, is similar to clinal variation reported for chromosomes and isozymes of this species. Mismatch distribution analyses suggests that geographical isolation and karyological changes have interplayed in a synergistic fashion. Fixation of the alternative chromosomal rearrangements in geographical isolation and secondary contact is the most likely mechanism accounting for the hybrid zone between the 2n = 38 and 2n = 44 races. If a molecular clock is assumed, with rates ranging from 2.3 to 5.0% per million years, then isolation between these races occurred within the last million years, implying a relatively recent origin of the extant diversity in Uroderma bilobatum. None the less, the three chromosomal races probably represent three different biological species.",

Information ﬂow between layers is suggested to enable the SC to mediate goal-directed orienting movements. While most mammals strongly rely on vision for orienting, some species such as echolocating bats have developed alternative strategies, which raises the question how sensory maps are organized in these animals. We probed the visual system of the echolocating bat Phyllostomus discolor and found that binocular high acuity vision is frontally oriented and thus aligned with the biosonar system, whereas monocular visual ﬁelds cover a large area of peripheral space. For the ﬁrst time in echolocating bats, we could show that in contrast with other mammals, visual processing is restricted to the superﬁcial layers of the SC. The topographic representation of visual space, however, followed the general mammalian pattern. In addition, we found a clear topographic representation of sound azimuth in the deeper collicular layers, which was congruent with the superﬁcial visual space map and with a previously documented map of orienting movements. Especially for bats navigating at high speed in densely structured environments, it is vitally important to transfer and coordinate spatial information between sensors and motor systems. Here, we demonstrate ﬁrst evidence for the existence of congruent maps of sensory space in the bat SC that might serve to generate a uniﬁed representation of the environment to guide motor actions.",

We set out to better understand the difference between mist netting and acoustic detection probabilities between these two methods for the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), a species highly impacted by white-­nose syndrome and currently considered for federal listing in the United States. We also analyzed occupancy relationships with local and landcover variables. We surveyed 15 sites using mist netting paired with an acoustic recorder for multiple nights to estimate detection probability of this species. We also deployed acoustic recorders at another 73 sites. We found that detection rates for mist netting were very low but increased with day of year and decreased from proximity to water. Acoustic surveys had higher detection rates, but there was an approximately 30% likelihood of false-­ positive detections. At the mean distance to water and day of year, acoustic surveys had a detection rate 55 times higher than mist netting. There were not significant factors influencing occupancy of little brown bats, only a slight positive relationship between forested largest patch, landscape patch richness and forest basal area. Given the declines in little brown bat populations since white-­nose syndrome, it is even more critical that we consider the very low detection rate of mist netting compared to acoustic surveys.",

Yet our knowledge about call intensities in the ﬁeld is restricted to a small number of species. We describe a novel stereo videogrammetry method used to study ﬂight and echolocation behaviour, and to measure call source levels of the aerial hawking bat Eptesicus bottae (Vespertilionidae). Bats ﬂew close to their predicted minimum power speed. Source level increased with call duration; the loudest call of E. bottae was at 133·dB·peSPL. The calculated maximum detection distance for large ﬂying objects (e.g. large prey, conspeciﬁcs) was up to 21·m. The corresponding maximum echo delay is almost exactly the duration of one wing beat in E. bottae and this also is its preferred pulse interval. These results, obtained by using videogrammetry to track bats in the ﬁeld, corroborate earlier ﬁndings from other species from acoustic tracking methods.",

In this study we show that the velvety free-tailed bat Molossus molossus emerges just after sunset and just before sunrise for very short foraging bouts (average 82.2 min foraging per night). Contrary to previous studies, bats remain inactive in their roost between activity patterns. Activity was measured over two complete lunar cycles and there was no indication that phase of the moon had an influence on emergence time or the numbers of bats that emerged from the roost. This data suggests that M. molossus represents an example of an aerial hawking bat whose foraging behaviour is in fact adapted to the compromise between the need to exploit highest prey availability and the need to avoid predation.",

Body mass and length of forearm at birth were lowest when precipitation in the month preceding births was relatively high. In addition, body mass at birth was signi®cantly lower when ambient temperatures during late pregnancy were relatively low. Pups born to middle age mothers were heavier than pups born to young or old mothers. When evaluated using mark±recapture data (longitudinal method), postnatal growth in length of forearm and body mass was greater for pups born to middle age and older mothers and change in body mass was greater for female pups than for male pups. When growth data were evaluated using the trajectory method, the rate of growth for length of forearm was greatest when ambient temperature was highest. Age prediction equations were improved when maternal age was incorporated into predictive equations. We recommend considering both intrinsic and extrinsic variables in studies where maternal effort is evaluated and age prediction equations are used for estimating postnatal growth rates in free-ranging bats.",

To reduce the impact of White-nose Syndrome to North American little brown bat populations we evaluated if exposure to volatile organic compounds produced by induced cells from Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain DAP96253 could improve the overwinter survival of bats infected by P. destructans. Two simultaneous field treatment trials were conducted at natural hibernacula located in Rockcastle and Breckinridge counties, Kentucky, USA. A combined total of 120 little brown bats were randomly divided into control groups (n = 60) which were not exposed to volatile organic compounds and treatment groups (n = 60) which were exposed to volatile organic compounds produced by non-growth, fermented cell paste composed of R. rhodochrous strain DAP96253 cells. Cox proportional hazard models revealed a significant decreased survival at the Rockcastle field trial site but not the Breckinridge field site. At the Breckinridge hibernacula, overwinter survival for both treatment and control groups were 60%. At the Rockcastle hibernacula, Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated significantly increased overwinter survival of bats in the control group (43% survived) compared to the treatment group (20% survived). Although complete inhibition of P. destructans by volatile organic compounds produced by induced R. rhodochrous strain DAP96253 cells was observed in vitro studies, our results suggest that these volatile organic compounds do not inhibit P. destructans in situ and may promote P. destructans growth.",

Similar to other European pipistrelles, the frequency structure during foraging varied. During the search phase, the bats emitted long shallow frequency-modulated pulses 9 – 11 ms in duration, whereas the maximum pulse duration of the bats approaching a large target wall in the laboratory was 3 ms. No signiﬁcant difference was observed between decreases in the interpulse interval during these two approach ﬂights. It is concluded that the bats use a long quasi-constant frequency pulse to ﬁnd a weak echo from a small prey target.",

The terminal frequency of the second harmonic (TF2) of pup vocalizations corresponded to that of the fundamental (TF1) in adult bats (41.4 6 2.6 kHz), suggesting that pup vocalizations can be easily detected by the mother. In addition, there are two types of infant vocalization: short duration echolocation precursor and long duration isolation calls, which showed separate developmental patterns over time.",

At least 7 species of mammals belonging to Insectivora (Crocidura suaveolens) and Rodentia (Allactaga williamsi, Cricetulus migratorius, Meriones tristrami, Mescocricetus brandti, Microtus guentheri, M. sp., Mus macedonicus) were identified. Rodentia were dominant and contributed 93.8% of the number of prey items of the Long-eared Owl. Microtus guentheri accounted for 83.9% of the rodent remains. The diet pattern was more diverse in summer, when some 24% of the diet consisted of non-mammal prey items (birds, insects).",

In bat limbs A-P patterning and the size of the digital field are unique. The posterior digits of the forelimb are elongated and joined by tissue, whereas the thumb is short. The hindlimb digits often are uniform in length. Here, we reveal novel expression patterns for\n              Shh\n              and its target,\n              Patched 1\n              (\n              Ptc1\n              ), during limb development in two bat species. Early\n              Shh\n              expression in the zone of polarizing activity is wider in the bat forelimb than in the mouse forelimb, correlating with the reported expansion of\n              Fgf8\n              expression in the apical ectodermal ridge and the early loss of symmetry in the bat forelimb. Later in limb development,\n              Shh\n              and\n              Ptc1\n              expression is reinitiated in the interdigital tissue.\n              Shh\n              is graded along the A-P axis in forelimb and is expressed uniformly at a lower level across the hindlimb interdigital tissue. We also show that the reported\n              Fgf8\n              expression in the interdigital tissue precedes the expression of\n              Shh.\n              We propose that the reinitiation of\n              Shh\n              and\n              Fgf8\n              expression in bat limbs reactivates the\n              Shh-Fgf\n              feedback loop in the interdigital tissue of stage 16 bat embryos. The cell survival and proliferation signals provided by the\n              Shh-Fgf\n              signaling loop probably contribute to the lengthening of the posterior forelimb digits, the survival of the forelimb interdigital webbing, and the extension of the hindlimb digits to a uniform length.",

The characteristic lesions include hemoglobinuric nephrosis and piecemeal hepatic necrosis with bile ductular hyperplasia and portal ﬁbrosis. Certain species, such as sheep, are prone to toxicity when exposed to copper in feed, whereas an inherent genetic defect of copper storage is present in some breeds of dogs (Bedlington Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, Doberman Pinschers). In nondomestic species, reference ranges have not been established for copper in internal organs, so the establishment of copper toxicity as a diagnosis is difﬁcult. A case of copper toxicity in a captive Mexican fruit bat is presented. Hepatic copper levels in 16 additional bats, of at least 3 different species, were measured. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst reported case of copper toxicity in a chiropteran.",

The fish-eating bat Myotis vivesi is restricted mainly to the islands of the Gulf of California in Mexico and although several aspects of its biology have been studied there are no recent accounts of its current distribution. We conducted several expeditions during – to verify the current geographical distribution of this bat, and to record the presence of introduced predators. We identified the localities in which maternity colonies occur, estimated the size of the bat population on Partida Norte Island in , and monitored bat presence on this island during –. We found fish-eating bats on  islands and maternity colonies on  islands. Introduced rats Rattus rattus or cats Felis catus were captured on seven islands where the bats were present, and on five islands where they were absent. We estimated a population of c. , fish-eating bats in May  and we confirmed the species’ presence on Partida Norte Island during –. Based on the information compiled from our surveys and previous studies, we discuss the adequacy of the species’ current categorization as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and its conservation status conferred by Mexican conservation authorities.",

            "abstractNote": "Tent-making bats modify leaves to build refuges. Leaf modiﬁcation involves energetic and defense costs that should be balanced by the beneﬁts of tent-roosting. The alteration of the leaf ’s vascular system reduces the tent’s life expectancy, so to obtain a beneﬁt, bats are expected to use tents regularly as long as they remain functional and not modify more leaves than necessary. Over 2 yr, we documented the dynamics of tent construction and use by Uroderma convexum and other bat species in the palm Sabal mauritiiformis in a Colombian transitional dry forest. We also assessed tent condition and compared it to nonmodiﬁed leaves of approximately the same age in focal palms. Probability of tent use by U. convexum varied between 57 percent during a reproductive period and 4 percent outside of this period. Bats cut the main vein of folioles, partially affecting water transport in the leaf. However, there were no differences between tents and nonmodiﬁed leaves in deterioration scores or deterioration rates over 1 yr. During 2 yr, 48 tents were lost for different causes, but this loss was balanced by the construction of 51 new tents. Thus, bats maintained an excess of usable tents. Palm leaves are long-lived and seem preadapted to sustain damage and remain viable, particularly in species growing in dry environments. We present several hypotheses to explain the advantage of maintaining a tent surplus.",

A comparison of the succession of morphological events associated with each node (inflorescences or branches developed or aborted and underlying internode length) making up the axes of 30 trees helped to establish a link between their architecture and the regularity and synchronicity of their expression of growth, flowering, and branching processes over time on an individual and stand level. For a given individual, new nodes are emitted at the same rate on all the axes, irrespective of their branching order. Flowering and branching alternate, and these processes occur in all the axes of the tree synchronously. On a stand level, flowering and branching occur regularly every 35 nodes or so, which apparently corresponds to an annual rhythm. Under nonlimiting conditions, a single branch tier would be emitted each year, and it is thus possible to determine a posteriori the age of a crown accurately. The merits of the method, the possibility of estimating the age of natural\n              Cecropia obtusa\n              regrowth by observing tree architecture, and the possible applications in the field of ecology are discussed.",

Its possible admission to the list of British mammals depends upon a single specimen found on South Ronaldsay, Orkney, in about September 1847 (Wolley, 1849, 1850\n              a, b\n              ). From Wolley's detailed account and description, there seems no doubt of the circumstances of the finding of the specimen, nor of its identity. Doubts are only raised by the existence of a specimen of\n              Lasiurus\n              in the Zoology Museum of the University of Cambridge which had been supposed to be the Orkney specimen. This specimen was examined by Barrett‐Hamilton (1910) who reported that it was an example of the Hawaiian form\n              L. c. semotus\n              (he used the name\n              Nycteris semota\n              ), noted that it did not match Wolley's careful description, but concluded “the matter is not as clear as it might be”. This doubt has persisted to the present day, and while the record is mentioned in some accounts (e.g. van den Brink, 1967), it is omitted completely from others, notably Corbet & Southern (1977). The uncertainty has prompted this brief re‐examination of the issue; in particular, what is the identity of the specimen in Cambridge, how does it compare with Wolley's account of the Orkney specimen, and what, in the light of modern knowledge of\n              L. cinereus\n              , is the likelihood of its occurrence as a vagrant in Britain?",

            "abstractNote": "Detailed knowledge of histomorphology is a prerequisite for the understanding of function, variation, and development. In bats, as in other mammals, penis and baculum morphology are important in species discrimination and phylogenetic studies. In this study, nondestructive 3D-microtomographic (microCT, mCT) images of bacula and iodine-stained penes of Pipistrellus pipistrellus were correlated with light microscopic images from undecalciﬁed surface-stained ground sections of three of these penes of P. pipistrellus (1 juvenile). The results were then compared with mCTimages of bacula of P. pygmaeus, P. hanaki, and P. nathusii. The Y-shaped baculum in all studied Pipistrellus species has a proximal base with two clubshaped branches, a long slender shaft, and a forked distal tip. The branches contain a medullary cavity of variable size, which tapers into a central canal of variable length in the proximal baculum shaft. Both are surrounded by a lamellar and a woven bone layer and contain fatty marrow and blood vessels. The distal shaft consists of woven bone only, without a vascular canal. The proximal ends of the branches are connected with the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa via entheses. In the penis shaft, the corpus spongiosumsurrounded urethra lies in a ventral grove of the corpora cavernosa, and continues in the glans under the baculum. The glans penis predominantly comprises an enlarged corpus spongiosum, which surrounds urethra and baculum. In the 12 studied juvenile and subadult P. pipistrellus specimens the proximal branches of the baculum were shorter and without marrow cavity, while shaft and distal tip appeared already fully developed. The present combination with light microscopic images from one species enabled a more reliable interpretation of histomorphological structures in the mCT-images from all four Pipistrellus species. J.

In bats, most pigmentation abnormalities have been observed in the families Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae, probably because they are the largest families in number of species and have been exceptionally well studied. For the Mormoopidae family only two cases are known. This paper documents the first case of hypopigmentation disorder in the bat Mormoops megalophylla throughout its range, recorded in two specimens captured in the state of Oaxaca, México.",

Here, we report a 47.89% Brucella infection prevalence in a colony of vampire bats inhabiting the tropical rainforest of Costa Rica. The bacterium induced placentitis and fetal death in bats. Wide-range phenotypic and genotypic characterization placed the Brucella organisms as a new pathogenic species named Brucella nosferati sp. nov., isolated from bat tissues, including the salivary glands, suggesting feeding behavior might favor transmission to their prey. Overall analyses placed B. nosferati as the etiological agent of a reported canine brucellosis case, demonstrating its potential for infecting other hosts. To assess the putative prey hosts, we analyzed the intestinal contents of 14 infected and 23 non-infected bats by proteomics. A total of 54,508 peptides sorted into 7,203 unique peptides corresponding to 1,521 proteins were identified. Twenty-three wildlife and domestic taxa, including humans, were foraged by B. nosferati-infected D. rotundus, suggesting contact of this bacterium with a broad range of hosts. Our approach is appropriate for detecting, in a single study, the prey preferences of vampire bats in a diverse area, demonstrating its suitability for control strategies where vampire bats thrive.",

The ﬂowers present nocturnal anthesis, copious nectar production and sugar concentration (range 18–23%) suitable for nocturnal visitors such as bats and sphingid moths. The main nocturnal visitors were bats and sphingid moths while bees were the main diurnal visitors. There were no differences in legitimate visitation rates among bats, moths and honey bees. Bats and honey bees fed mainly on pollen while moths fed on nectar, suggesting resource partitioning. Eight species of bats carried pollen but Leptonycteris yerbabuenae is probably the most effective pollinator due to its higher pollen loads. The sphingid moths Manduca rustica, Cocytius duponchel and Eumorpha satellitia were recorded visiting ﬂowers. Hand pollination experiments indicated a predominant outcrossing breeding system. Open pollination experiments resulted in a null fruit set, indicating pollen limitation; however, mean reproductive success, according to a seasonal census, was 17 ± 3%; these contrasting results could be explained by the seasonal availability of pollinators. We conclude that P. aquatica is an outcrossing species with a pollination system originally specialized for bats and sphingid moths, which could be driven to a multimodal pollination system due to the introduction of honey bees to tropical America.",

However, we have virtually no information on whether and how disruptions in bat‐mediated biocontrol services are driven by mismatches between the temporal activity patterns of insectivorous bats and insect pests.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We investigated the temporal relationship between the nightly activity patterns of the common pipistrelle bat (\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii\n                    ) and the olive fruit moth (\n                    Prays oleae\n                    ).

Olive farms were classified as exhibiting high (i.e. HIGH olive farms;\n                    n\n                     = 27), intermediate (MID;\n                    n\n                     = 18), and low (LOW;\n                    n\n                     = 15) structural complexity.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Temporal mismatches between the activity levels of\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    and\n                    P. oleae\n                    varied between seasons and types of olive farms, being comparatively lower in summer than in spring and fall. Furthermore, summer was the only season in which temporal mismatches between species pairs differed between types of olive farms, with higher temporal mismatches found in LOW than in HIGH and MID olive farms.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Overall, our work demonstrates the existence of temporal mismatches between the nightly activity patterns of\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    and\n                    P. oleae\n                    . Furthermore, it demonstrates that the structural simplification of olive farms increases temporal mismatches between species pairs, particularly in summer when bat‐mediated biocontrol services are most needed.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Future research should consider mismatches between the temporal activity patterns of insectivorous bats and insect pests. Otherwise, the actual impact of agricultural intensification on bat‐mediated biocontrol services as well as the economic impact of their loss on the agriculture industry might be underestimated. To enhance biocontrol services, we propose increasing the availability of suitable roosting and foraging sites as well as conserving areas of remnant native woodland and scattered hollow‐bearing trees.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Resumo\n            \n              \n                \n                  Os serviços de biocontrole são amplamente reconhecidos por providenciarem incentivos fundamentais para a conservação de morcegos. No entanto, não existe virtualmente nenhuma informação sobre se e como as disrupções nos serviços de biocontrole mediados por morcegos são causadas por divergências entre os padrões temporais de atividade de morcegos insetívoros e insetos‐praga.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Investigámos a relação temporal entre os padrões de atividade noturna do morcego‐de‐kuhl (\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii\n                    ) e da traça‐da‐oliveira (\n                    Prays oleae\n                    ). As divergências temporais entre pares de espécies foram estimadas como a diferença de tempo (expressa como percentagem da noite) em que\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    e\n                    P. oleae\n                    atingiram 50% de sua abundância.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    O estudo foi realizado durante a primavera, verão e outono entre 2017 e 2019 em 60 olivais representando níveis crescentes de simplificação estrutural (usada como um indicador da intensificação agrícola). Os olivais foram classificados como exibindo complexidade estrutural alta (HIGH;\n                    n\n                     = 27), intermédia (MID;\n                    n\n                     = 18) ou baixa (LOW;\n                    n\n                     = 15).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    As divergências temporais entre os níveis de atividade de\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    e\n                    P. oleae\n                    variaram entre as estações do ano e tipos de olivais, sendo comparativamente menores no verão do que na primavera e outono. Além disso, o verão foi a única estação em que as divergências temporais entre pares de espécies diferiram entre tipos de olivais, com divergências temporais mais elevadas em olivais LOW do que em olivais HIGH e MID.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    No geral, o nosso trabalho demonstra a existência de divergências temporais entre os padrões de atividade noturna de\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    e\n                    P. oleae\n                    . Além disso, demonstra que a simplificação estrutural dos olivais aumenta as divergências temporais entre pares de espécies, especialmente no verão, quando os serviços de biocontrole mediados por morcegos são mais necessários.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Síntese e aplicações\n                    : Os trabalhos de investigação no futuro devem ter em conta as divergências entre os padrões temporais de atividade de morcegos insetívoros e insetos‐praga. Caso contrário, o impacto real da intensificação agrícola nos serviços de biocontrole mediados por morcegos, bem como o impacto económico da sua perda na indústria agrícola, pode ser subestimado. Para incrementar os serviços de biocontrole, propomos o aumento da disponibilidade de abrigos e locais de alimentação, bem como a conservação de áreas de bosques nativos remanescentes e árvores dispersas.",

Species that are forest dependent may be especially vulnerable to fragmentation because they have specialized resource requirements and may exhibit lower mobility in an agricultural matrix. We investigated movement patterns and resource selection of forest-dependent northern long-eared myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) in a forest–agricultural landscape on Prince Edward Island, Canada. Radiotelemetry was used to locate day-roosts and to estimate locations of female bats during nightly foraging bouts. Day-roost locations and foraging areas were mapped using a geographic information system to generally characterize the forest cover of foraging and roosting areas. Vegetative structure and insect prey availability were measured in the ﬁeld and compared between foraging and roosting areas to describe resource selection at these sites. Movements of female northern long-eared myotis were constrained to forest features and foraging areas were concentrated along forest-covered creeks with bats roosting predominantly in deciduous trees within the same forest fragment, although bats at 1 site seemed to exclusively use a barn during late pregnancy and lactation. Differences in prey availability did not explain the spatial segregation of roosting and foraging areas. Relative to roost areas foraging sites were more likely to be close to forested creeks and densely forested areas, whereas roost sites were characterized by the availability of potentially suitable roosts. This study demonstrates the importance of investigating movements and resource selection of individuals in fragmented landscapes because a specialization on forest resources can highly restrict the vagility of forest-dependent species to a local environment.",

Acerodon jubatus (the Golden-Crowned flying fox) is an endemic species in the Philippines, which was suspected to be a host of the Reston strain of the Ebola virus. As nocturnal animals, the flying foxes spend daytime at the roosting site, which they use for self-maintenance and reproduction. To understand the variation in diurnal behavior and time allocation for various activities in the Golden-Crowned flying fox, we investigated their daytime behavior and activity budget using instantaneous scan sampling and all occurrence focal sampling. Data collection was performed from 07:00 to 18:00 hr during January 8–17, 2017. The most frequent activity was sleeping (76.3%). The remaining activities were wing flapping (5.0%), self-grooming (4.2%), hanging relaxation (3.4%), wing spread (2.9%), movement (2.4%), mating/courtship (2.4%), aggression (1.9%), hanging alert (1.2%), excretion (0.1%) and scent marks (0.05%). The frequency of sleeping, wing flapping, self-grooming, hanging relaxation, aggression, mating/courtship and movement behaviors changed with the time of the day. Females allocated more time for resting than males, while males spent more time on the activities that helped enhance their mating opportunities, for example, movement, sexual activity and territorial behavior.",

Understanding their population dynamics might help to explain seasonal patterns of disease prevalence, and contribute towards the conservation of flying fox populations. Therefore, this study explored the annual variation in the number of deaths in P. lylei. The study was conducted from 2015–2017, at a Buddhist temple in Thailand, which is the roosting site of P. lylei. The average total number of bat deaths in a month significantly varied between times of a year. A peak was observed during March and May, which ranged in the period of birthing and lactating. There were no significant differences in the average total number of bat deaths in a month between sexes or age classes across times of a years.",

            "abstractNote": "In this study, we explicitly examine the aerodynamics of manoeuvring flight in animals. We studied brown long-eared bats flying in a wind tunnel while performing basic sideways manoeuvres. We used particle image velocimetry in combination with high-speed filming to link aerodynamics and kinematics to understand the mechanistic basis of manoeuvres. We predicted that the bats would primarily use the downstroke to generate the asymmetries for the manoeuvre since it has been shown previously that the majority of forces are generated during this phase of the wingbeat. We found instead that the bats more often used the upstroke than they used the downstroke for this. We also found that the bats used both drag/thrust-based and lift-based asymmetries to perform the manoeuvre and that they even frequently switch between these within the course of a manoeuvre. We conclude that the bats used three main modes: lift asymmetries during downstroke, thrust/drag asymmetries during downstroke and thrust/drag asymmetries during upstroke. For future studies, we hypothesize that lift asymmetries are used for fast turns and thrust/drag for slow turns and that the choice between up- and downstroke depends on the timing of when the bat needs to generate asymmetries.",

Few studies have combined traditional methods and molecular tools for the analysis of dispersal in fragmented landscapes. Here seed dispersal distances were documented for the tree Dipteryx panamensis in continuous forest and two forest fragments in Costa Rica, Central America. Distance matrices were calculated between adult trees (n = 283) and the locations of seeds (n = 3016) encountered along 100 × 4-m transects (n = 77). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the density of seeds dispersed > 25 m from the nearest adult (n = 253) among sites. There was a strong correlation between the locations of dispersed seeds and the locations of overstorey palms favoured as bat feeding roosts in continuous forest and both fragments. Exact dispersal distances were determined for a subset of seeds (n = 14) from which maternal endocarp DNA could be extracted and matched to maternal trees using microsatellite analysis. Dispersal within fragments and from pasture trees into adjacent fragments was documented, at a maximum distance of 853 m. Results show no evidence of a fragmentation effect on D. panamensis seed dispersal in this landscape and strongly suggest bat-mediated dispersal at all sites.",

A pilot study of nine adult male bats was conducted to determine whether use of the cave was regular enough for a homing study. Eight bats returned to the cave over the 3-week monitoring period, six on the night following release. Nine additional bats carrying radio transmitters were then released at three sites (three at each site) c. 5, 10 and 20 km due east of the cave; sites estimated to be located within, on the border of, and outside the population's known familiar area respectively. All but one of these nine bats were subsequently detected at the cave. Results suggest that adult long-tailed bats are able to return home following displacement both inside and outside their familiar area. Implications of these findings for translocations of bats and the possession of a potential long-distance navigation system by this species are discussed.",

Progeny in sample fruits were tested for self or cross paternity using an isozyme genetic marker. Pseudobombax munguba has nocturnal, white, brushlike ﬂowers that, surprisingly, lack nectar, and they are pollinated by a single, large bat species, Phyllostomus hastatus. Although self pollen tubes penetrated ovules with equal facility to cross tubes, fully selfed ﬂowers failed to form fruits. Flowers with mixed (self + cross) pollinations set fewer fruits than those of full crosses, and the fruiting success decreased with self : cross pollen ratio (i.e., 1 : 1 vs. 3 : 1). Fruits from such mixed pollinations contained varying but generally low (mean 3.3%, range 0%–22%) numbers of selfed seed. We conclude that although P. munguba lacks a conventional stigmatic or stylar self-incompatibility mechanism, the combination of exclusive pollination by a wide-ranging bat vector and the death of most selfed ovules provide this species with a highly outcrossing mating system.",

The commercial application of microbial chitinase is appealing due to the relative ease of enormous production and to meet the current world demands. This study aimed at isolation and characterization of chitin degrading bacteria from the gut of Indian tropical insectivorous black‐bearded tomb bat, Taphozous melanopogon. The isolated bacterial strains were characterized through biochemical analysis and nucleic acid‐based approaches by 16S ribosomal RNA amplification and sequencing. The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and phylogenetic analysis showed that the bacterial strain exhibited a close resemblance with Escherichia fergusonii. The chitinolytic activity of the E. fergusonii AMC01 was identified using supplemented colloidal chitin with agar medium. Compiling all, these findings would facilitate in constructing a database and presumably promote the use of E. fergusonii AMC01 as an efficient strain for the chitinase production.",

The former European bat species\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    was split into two,\n                    Pipistrelus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. and\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    , over 20 years ago. However, their distribution, breeding and winter ranges as well as migratory status in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus remained obscure.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  In our study, we scrutinised records of both species and assessed the sex ratio during their breeding season in this region.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We show that\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. has a significantly smaller range than previously assumed, being restricted to the southern part of the study area. On the contrary,\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    has a broader distribution, covering the Caucasus and Eastern Europe, up to ca. 59° N. Hence, all historical records and long‐distance movements of\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    sensu lato from Eastern Europe within the inferred allopatric occurrence of\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    should be attributed to\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The high portion of adult males in breeding localities, mass wintering within the breeding range and lacking evidence of long‐distance seasonal movements imply that\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. is a sedentary species. In\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    , the sex ratio among adults during the breeding season varies latitudinally. The female‐biased sex ratio, absence of mass wintering and the historical long‐distance recoveries of ringed individuals suggest that this species is migratory in Eastern Europe. The male‐biased sex ratio during the breeding season, along with late autumn records, suggests that the Caucasus represents its winter range.",

As the study was carried out in a landscape that was profoundly altered by industrial forestry, we predicted that in a better preserved landscape this species would select smaller feeding areas located at closer distances from the roost, according to the optimal foraging theory, and would use almost exclusively the preferred habitat, i.e., native deciduous woodland. To test these hypotheses, we radiotracked 14 R. euryale from the largest known breeding colony of northern Iberian Peninsula and determined their habitat selection, spatial foraging pattern, and hunting behaviour. Our predictions on habitat selection, as well as on the foraging site size and on commuting range were confirmed. Rhinolophus euryale used almost exclusively native deciduous woodland, and hedgerows were positively selected. We suggest that the richness of tree species in hedgerows provides a high prey availability sustained in time and space. Our findings show that habitat disturbance constitutes a major cause of decline for R. euryale in the study area.",

            "abstractNote": "In a Geoffroy's bat Myotis emarginatus colony in central Iberia, we investigated the foraging behaviour of six lactating females by means of radio-tracking and the diet of 23 individuals by faecal analysis. The bats preferred to forage mainly in pine plantations, riparian woodland, and scrubland, whereas native dehesa (a loose semi-natural oak Quercus rotundifolia and Q. suber woodland) was not exploited as expected. By far the most important prey type for this bat in the Mediterranean were spiders. We conclude that Geoffroy's bat prefers to forage in multistratified dense habitats, even if these include nonnative plantations. The vertical structuring and especially high cover, along with the combination of both parameters are important for this highly manoeuvrable, clutter-tolerant bat. This is valid even when the vertical component is much reduced as occurs in scrubland, in the first succession steps to woodland creation, and in degraded conditions. Under such circumstances, aerial weaving spiders might be detected and captured when lying in their webs. It is likely that dehesa is too loosely wooded to offer suitable characteristics for orb-weaving aerial spiders to build webs, and thus it may not be as attractive for M emarginatus as more dense habitats.",

Currently, this disease is spreading in rural and urban areas of non-endemic regions in Brazil. Recently, bats have gained epidemiological signiﬁcance in leishmaniasis due to its close relationship with human settlements. In this study, we investigated the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in blood samples from 448 bats belonging to four families representing 20 species that were captured in the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba areas of Minas Gerais State (non-endemic areas for leishmaniasis), Brazil. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected in 8·0% of the blood samples, 41·6% of which were Leishmania infantum, 38·9% Leishmania amazonensis and 19·4% Leishmania braziliensis. No positive correlation was found between Leishmania spp. and bat food source. The species with more infection rates were the insectivorous bats Eumops perotis; 22·2% (4/18) of which tested positive for Leishmania DNA. The presence of Leishmania in the bat blood samples, as observed in this study, represents epidemiological importance due to the absence of Leishmaniasis cases in the region.",

They were laparatomized for evaluation of macroscopic characteristics and the digestive tube segments were collected for fixation in 10% neutral formalin for histological processing, after 48 h of fixation. Macroscopically, the digestive tube had an oesophageal segment in the abdominal cavity, with a J-s­ haped saccular stomach, in addition to a small intestine divided into duodenum, jejunum-i­leum and terminal ileum. In the large intestine, an organ dilatation was observed from the small intestine with a one-w­ ay oral-­ aboral ending in the anus, which was called the descending colon. Morphological similarity of the walls of all segments with those of other mammals was observed; however, it presented some peculiarities such as the absence of oesophageal glands, Brunner in the intestine, cecum and appendages. The anatomical disposition and tissue pattern were similar to that found in other insectivorous species. The adaptations of the digestive tube of this species are possibly due to the insectivorous feeding habits, which can be impacted due to anthropic actions in foraging environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Many viruses that cause serious and often fatal disease in humans have spilled over from bats. Recent evidence suggests that stress may enhance virus shedding by bats increasing the possibility of transmission to other species. To understand the reasons for spillover is therefore important to determine the molecular pathways that link stress to virus reactivation and shedding in bats. We recently isolated and characterized a gammaherpesvirus (Eptesicus fuscus herpesvirus, EfHV) autochthonous to North American big brown bats. Since herpesviruses are known to reactivate from latent infections in response to a wide variety of stressors, EfHV presents us with an opportunity to study how physiological, behavioural or environmental changes may influence the big brown bats’ relationship with EfHV. To understand the biology of the virus and how the extended periods of torpor experienced by these bats during hibernation along with the stress of arousal might influence the virus‐host relationship, we attempted to detect the virus in the blood of wild‐caught nonhibernating bats as well as captive bats arising from hibernation. We compared the prevalence of EfHV in the blood (using PCR) and EfHV‐specific antibodies (using ELISA) between captive hibernating bats and wild‐caught non‐hibernating bats. We detected EfHV only in the blood of captive hibernating bats (27.8% = 10/36) and not in wild‐caught non‐hibernating bats (0.0% = 0/43). In contrast, the EfHV‐specific antibody titres were higher in the non‐hibernating bats compared to the hibernating bats. Our study suggests that: (a) viral DNA in blood indicates reactivation from latency, (b) long periods of hibernation lead to suppression of immunity, (c) stress of arousal from hibernation reactivates the virus in bats with lower levels of anti‐viral immunity (indicated by humoral immune response), and (d) levels of anti‐viral immunity increase in non‐hibernating bats following reactivation.",

The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites.\n            \n            \n              2\n              Hand pollination experiments showed\n              S. siamensis\n              to be partially self‐incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit.\n            \n            \n              3\n              Shorea siamensis\n              was pollinated by small\n              Trigona\n              bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites.\n            \n            \n              4\n              At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected.\n            \n            \n              5\n              Our results suggest that high reproductive success of\n              S. siamensis\n              is dependent upon cross‐pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The cranial osteology of the megachiropteran Pteropus brisson, 1762, was the subject of recent study that covered all of the skull bones in significant detail, except for the anatomy of the nasal capsule. here, we describe and illustrate the internal nasal skeleton of Pteropus lylei k. andersen, 1908, using histological sections of a fetus and high resolution X-ray computed tomographic (hRXCT) imagery of an adult specimen. The internal nasal skeleton of Pteropus lacks a rostral nasoturbinal and includes a caudal nasoturbinal that corresponds to the ossified crista semicircularis of the fetus; three endoturbinals; one ectoturbinal; the maxilloturbinal; and a low basal crest that may represent a rudimentary element. We describe in detail the structure and connections of these elements in Pteropus. The maxilloturbinal is the largest element. In cross section, the caudal nasoturbinal is unilaminar, the maxilloturbinal is double bilaminar (i.e., each of the basal twin laminae splits further into two secondary laminae), and the other elements range from incipient to asymmetrically double bilaminar (i.e., one branch simple, the other split). all turbinals of the ethmoidal labyrinth contribute to the cribriform plate, creating a specific pattern of cribriform foramina. The elements found in Pteropus are compared with those of other well-known mammals with relatively few turbinal elements, including other bats, primates, canids, and marsupials. We show that, despite terminological discrepancies across studies, homologies are straightforward to establish among these taxa and so comparative or phylogenetic studies may benefit from inclusion of turbinal characters.",

Although some aspects of emergence behavior are understood, one previously unexplored area is the specific order in which individuals emerge. The goal of our research was to determine if big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, fitted with passive integrated transponder tags emerge from roosts in buildings each evening in a nonrandom order. We assessed relative and absolute order of emergence to determine if order is concordant across nights and whether individuals consistently emerge in close association with specific roost mates. We found significant concordance in rank order among nights at all roosts. At 5 roosts concordance decreased as time between dates increased. Association rates between individuals were low, and temporal analyses revealed that associations rapidly degraded over time, indicating that bats do not emerge each evening consistently with the same group of roost mates. We discuss how social structure, information transfer, and/or individual energetic needs could be responsible for the observed nonrandom patterns of emergence. Our results suggest that emergence order represents behavioral information that traditionally has been overlooked and that might be useful for characterizing aspects of the ecology and social behavior of bats and other species with cryptic behavior.",

In Patagonia, this family is represented by seven species in three genera (Histiotus, Lasiurus and Myotis). In this study, we analyzed the distribution of two vespertilionid species, Lasiurus villosissimus and Myotis dinellii, including new southernmost records, and their relationship with environmental variables. Two different spatial scales were analyzed: a continental approach for species distribution analyses (South America), and local trapping of bats in northwestern Chubut province, Argentina. We present new southern limits for L. villosissimus and M. dinellii, and included new records for Patagonian bats. The big hoary bat L. villosissimus was recorded as the largest bat inhabiting Patagonia, relating it as a bat mainly inhabiting low, humid and temperate/warm areas. The little yellow bat M. dinellii, instead, is the smallest mammal and the smallest bat recorded in Patagonia to date, related mainly with dry, mid-altitude and temperate/warm areas.",

However, the presence of cryptic strategies often results in situations where social mating system is not reflective of genetic mating system. We present such a study of the genetic mating system of a harem-forming bat Cynopterus sphinx where harems may not be true indicators of male reproductive success. This temporal study using data from six seasons on paternity reveals that social harem assemblages do not play a role in the mating system, and variance in male reproductive success is lower than expected assuming polygynous mating. Further, simulations reveal that the genetic mating system is statistically indistinguishable from promiscuity. Our results are in contrast to an earlier study that demonstrated high variance in male reproductive success. Although an outcome of behavioural mating patterns, standardized variance in male reproductive success (Im) affects the opportunity for sexual selection. To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary implications of promiscuity for mammals in general, we compared our estimates of Im and total opportunity for sexual selection (Im ⁄ If, where If is standardized variance in female reproductive success) with those of other known promiscuous species. We observed a broad range of Im ⁄ If values across known promiscuous species, indicating our poor understanding of the evolutionary implications of promiscuous mating.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are social animals and display a diverse variety of mating and social systems, with most species exhibiting some form of polygyny. Their social organization is fluid and individuals frequently switch partners and roosting sites. While harem-like social organization is observed in multiple tropical species, its importance is contested in many of them. In this study, we investigated the role of harems in the social organization of the old world fruit bat\n              Cynopterus sphinx\n              . Based on regular behavioural observations over a period of 20 months and genetic data from microsatellite markers, we observed that the social organization is flexible, individuals regularly shift between roosts and the social organization resembles a fission–fusion society. Behavioural and genetic analyses suggest that the harems are not strict units of social structure, and the colony does not show signatures of subdivision with harems as behavioural units. We also observed that there was no correlation between individuals with high association index and pairwise relatedness. Our findings indicate that similar to the mating system, the social organization of\n              C. sphinx\n              can also be categorized as a fission–fusion society, and hence the term ‘harem’ is a misnomer. We conclude that the social system of\n              C. sphinx\n              is flexible, with multi-male multi-female organization, and individuals tend to be loyal to a given area rather than a roost.",

Our study deals with social call structure of a recently discovered species, Pipistrellus hanaki. Because it shares a common ancestor with P. pygmaeus, we hypothesized that as in the other species from this group social call structure in P. hanaki retains the basic design observed in other bats from the same genus. We also hypothesized that as in other pipistrelles such calls fulfill context-dependent functions, being used by both foraging and mating bats for different purposes. However, we found that these calls have a structure rather different from that seen in most pipistrelles. Two different types of multi-harmonic, broad-band and long-duration social calls were identified, with distinctive temporal structures. Single component, frequency modulated-quasi constant frequency (FM-QCF) calls were emitted during summer at foraging sites where feeding buzzes were regularly produced. In autumn, when feeding buzz rates decreased and males caught at recording sites had prominent testes, a second type of single or multi-component calls with a fluctuating frequency over time was more frequent. Unlike the typical multi-component social calls recorded in several Pipistrellus species, our results suggest that social calls used by foraging or mating P. hanaki have markedly different structures. Because social calls of bats are speciesspecific and may function in reproductive isolation, we hypothesize that differentiation of social calls in P. hanaki has been associated with the divergence of this species from P. pygmaeus.",

Considering the microbiota–host as a unity, in which extrinsic (as food availability and geography) or intrinsic factors (as physiology) play an important role in the microbiota composition, we would expect differentiation in the microbiota of two geographically separated populations. The Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASVs) of the V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene from 68 individuals were analyzed using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We obtained a total of 11 566 (ASVs). The bacterial communities in the Central and Pacific populations had a diversity of 6,939 and 4,088 ASVs, respectively, sharing a core microbiota of 539 ASVs accounting for 75% of the relative abundance, suggesting stability over evolutionary time. The Weighted UniFrac metrics tested by a PERMANOVA showed that lactating and pregnant females had significant beta diversity differences in the two populations compared with other reproductive stages. This could be a consequence of the increased energy requirements of these physiological stages, more than the variation due to geographical separation. In contrast, a positive correlation of the observed ASVs of fecal microbiota with the observed ASVs of plastids related to the diet was observed in the juveniles and adults, suggesting that in these physiological stages an extrinsic factor as the diet shapes the microbiota composition. The results provide a baseline for future studies of the microbiome in these two wild populations of the lesser long-nosed bat, the main pollinator of the Agaves from which the beverages tequila and mezcal are made.",

This has led to uncertainties about the distribution of the species, that was once considered an Atlantic Forest endemic. Based on an analysis of a large and geographically restricted series of P. recifinus, we assessed the individual variation in the species and provide useful characters to separate it from P. lineatus. We reviewed the locality records of P. recifinus, and carried out an ecological niche model analysis in order to update the species polygon and calculate its area of habitat. After removing misidentifications, we found that the species occurs in moist forests from sea level to 1653 m. The area of suitable habitat estimated for the species was 402,225.2 Km2, ranging from the Brazilian states of Ceará to Santa Catarina. Both empirical records and ecological niche model analyses reinforce that P. recifinus should be considered an Atlantic Forest endemic. The species is present in moist forest enclaves in the Caatinga, but these formations are part of the Atlantic Forest domain.",

Here, using footage from a high-speed camera, the first comparative study of the performance during the wing induced phase of take-off in six insectivorous bat species is described. Despite distinct differences in foraging strategy, the mass specific power generated by the bats during wing induced take-off did not differ between species, with the exception of Myotis capaccinii. This suggests that differences in take-off performance may only be evident in bats that exhibit particularly unusual foraging strategies, such as the trawling behaviour of M. capaccinii – with differences in the remaining species only manifesting in subtler aspects of flight performance such as agility or manoeuvrability. The poorer take-off performance of M. capaccinii could be related to either a reduction in wing-stroke amplitude to stop the wings hitting the water’s surface during foraging or perhaps an effect of having very large feet. No scaling relationship between body mass and mass-specific take-off power was found, which supports earlier research on birds and insects, suggesting that the mass-specific muscle power available for flight is broadly similar across a large range of body sizes and species.",

The work detailed in this article tested whether pups learn about novel food from interactions with their mothers during foraging and develop preferences. Mother-pup pairs or pups alone were trained during postnatal days (PND) 46–50 using Mangifera indica as a novel fruit. They were then tested during PND 61–65 for food preferences in relation to a known fruit (Achras sapota) and the novel fruit (M. indica). When the trained pups and untrained pups were tested for food preferences independently, those trained with the mother were found to exhibit significantly more marked preferences for the novel fruit as compared with either the pups trained without their mothers or the untrained pups. They made a greater number of feeding attempts and bouts in respect of the novel fruit. However, pups trained without their mothers and untrained pups also both showed a response to the novel fruit during the later period of testing. The results suggest that mother-pup interactions during the early foraging period may provide an opportunity for C. sphinx pups to learn about novel food sources thanks to their mother. Later they may learn independently on the basis of experience from mother’s milk and/or social interaction with conspecifics.",

            "abstractNote": "Age-related telomere shortening is considered a hallmark of the ageing process. However, a recent cross-sectional ageing study of relative telomere length (rTL) in bats failed to detect a relationship between rTL and age in the long-lived genus Myotis (M. myotis and M. bechsteinii), suggesting some other factors are responsible for driving telomere dynamics in these species. Here, we test if longitudinal rTL data show signatures of age-associated telomere attrition in M. myotis and differentiate which intrinsic or extrinsic factors are likely to drive telomere length dynamics. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, rTL was measured in 504 samples from a marked population, from Brittany, France, captured between 2013 and 2016. These represent 174 individuals with an age range of 0 to 7+ years. We find no significant relationship between rTL and age (p = .762), but demonstrate that within-individual rTL is highly variable from year to year. To investigate the heritability of rTL, a population pedigree (n = 1744) was constructed from genotype data generated from a 16-microsatellite multiplex, designed from an initial, low-coverage, Illumina genome for M. myotis. Heritability was estimated in a Bayesian, mixed model framework, and showed that little of the observed variance in rTL is heritable (h2 = 0.01–0.06). Rather, correlations of first differences, correlating yearly changes in telomere length and weather variables, demonstrate that, during the spring transition, average temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall and windspeed correlate with changes in longitudinal telomere dynamics. As such, rTL may represent a useful biomarker to quantify the physiological impact of various environmental stressors in bats.",

Many previous studies have concentrated on the importance of diurnal visitors in pollination, and consequently, information on the contribution of nocturnal visitors to pollination in early spring is limited. This study was conducted to evaluate the relative importance of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators in the early spring flowering dioecious shrub Stachyurus praecox (Stachyuraceae), in two temperate forests in central Japan. Visitors to the female and male flowers were observed during day and night, and their relative contributions to seed set were compared. The pollinator observations revealed that the diurnal and nocturnal insects visited both male and female flowers, and that the main flower visitors were diurnal small bees and flies as well as nocturnal settling moths. The diurnal and nocturnal flower visitors also acted as pollinators, as the pollen grains of S. praecox were attached to the insects collected from the female flowers. Pollination experiments demonstrated that the contributions of diurnal pollinators to the seed set were higher than those of the nocturnal pollinators. The results of this study indicate that S. praecox has a generalized pollination system, comprising both diurnal insects and nocturnal settling moths. Although the roles of diurnal insects are more important in the pollination of S. praecox, nocturnal settling moths may have a complementary role in early spring.",
