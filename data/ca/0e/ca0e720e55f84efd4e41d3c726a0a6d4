            "abstractNote": "Perceptual abilities of animals, like echolocating bats, are difficult to study because they challenge our understanding of non-visual senses. We used novel acoustic tomography to convert echoes into visual representations and compare these cues to traditional echo measurements. We provide a new hypothesis for the echo-acoustic basis of prey detection on surfaces. We propose that bats perceive a change in depth profile and an ‘acoustic shadow’ cast by prey. The shadow is more salient than prey echoes and particularly strong on smooth surfaces. This may explain why bats look for prey on flat surfaces like leaves using scanning behaviour. We propose that rather than forming search images for prey, whose characteristics are unpredictable, predators may look for disruptions to the resting surface (acoustic shadows). The fact that the acoustic shadow is much fainter on rougher resting surfaces provides the first empirical evidence for ‘acoustic camouflage’ as an anti-predator defence mechanism.\n          , \n            While bats are far from blind, they are famed for their use of sound waves to home in on their prey. As they fly, bats send out a series of high-frequency calls that bounce off nearby objects, including insects. By listening to the echoes, the bats are able to build up an auditory image of their environment and thus pinpoint the location of their prey.\n            Although echolocation is effective for localizing flying insects, it is less suited to detecting those that are resting on surfaces. This is due to the difficulty of distinguishing sound waves that bounce off the insect from those that are reflected by the surrounding surface. While some species of bats get around this problem by listening for faint sounds made by prey, such as mating calls or the fluttering of insect wings, a number of bat species have found a way to detect entirely motionless prey using echolocation.\n            Clare and Holderied have now worked out how bats might do this. A method was devised to convert the sound waves that bounce off an object into visual signals, and thus, open them up for analysis by human observers. This technique was used to scan moths of various shapes and sizes resting on different surfaces: smooth slate, leaves, coarse limestone, and rough bark. These experiments showed that the difference in the strength of the echoes from the moth and its surroundings varied depending on the texture of the surface.\n            Specifically, the difference was greatest when the insect was resting on smooth slate and smallest when it was on rough bark, suggesting that choice of surface affects how easy it is to spot an insect. Unexpectedly, however, the data also indicate that bats may search for insects by seeking out interruptions in the echoes from the surface, rather than trying to detect echoes from the prey itself. This makes the bats' task a little easier as it means that they do not have to make adjustments for the differing sizes and shapes of insects. Instead, they can use an acoustic search image for what the surface is like and look for missing parts covered up by the prey.\n            Clare and Holderied's findings thus generate a number of predictions about the behaviour of bats and insects in their natural environment. Bats should prefer searching for insects on smooth surfaces rather than rough ones; but insects might attempt ‘acoustic camouflage’ by choosing to rest on rough surfaces rather than smooth.",

We identified 61 prey species of insects and 5 species of arachnid. The largest proportion of prey ( 32%) were identified as species of the mass-emerging Ephemeroptera (mayfly) genus Caenis. Bats roosting in agricultural settings had lower dietary richness than those occupying a roost located on a forest fragment in a conservation area. We detected temporal fluctuations in diet over the maternity season. Dipteran (fly) species dominated the diet early in the season, replaced later by species of mayfly. Because our methodology provides species-level identification of prey, we were able to isolate environmental indicator species in the diet and draw conclusions about the location and type of their foraging habitat and the health of these aquatic systems. The species detected suggested that the bats use variable habitats; members of one agricultural roost foraged on insects originating in rivers or streams while those in another agricultural roost and the forest roost fed on insects from pond or lake environments. All source water for prey was of fair to good quality, though no species detected are intolerant of pollution thus the habitat cannot be classified as pristine. Our study outlines a model system to investigate the abiotic and biotic interactions between habitat factors through this simple food chain to the top predator.",

With the identification of highly susceptible cell lines, reconstitution of infectious bat IAV by reverse genetics recently succeeded and allowed a first insight into the life cycle of these viruses. Although there is a certain degree of functional compatibility between bat and conventional influenza A virus proteins, there are striking differences, including receptor usage, polarity of infection and reassortment potential.",

            "abstractNote": "Woodland bat assemblages are usually structured in a space according to the distance from the ground, water, and obstacles, features that often define chiropteran hunting tactics. Consequently, the bat species composition differs strongly among various habitats, even within the same forest patch. However, when conducting local bat surveys in Wolin National Park (WPN), we revealed an unexpected uniformity in the qualitative and quantitative structure of bat assemblages, based on mist netting and ultrasound recording. In total, 10 vespertilionid species were detected. Across all methods and sampled habitats, a single species, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, predominated, while no Barbastella barbastellus, an old forest specialist, were detected, despite the abundance of their preferred daily roosts. We also reviewed the literature for mist-netted bat samples in four different habitats in lowland Polish forests. The samples usually clustered based on habitats, and the same habitat classes often clustered very closely despite representing geographically distant forests. The exception was WPN, where all four habitat classes formed a tightly packed cluster. We hypothesize that P. pygmaeus might act as a hyperabundant native species, a successful generalist that reduces the contribution of more specialized taxa in the assemblage. It probably benefits from both forest renaturation and anthropogenic cross-boundary subsidy.",

Genomes corresponding to members of the families Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, Herpesviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Astroviridae were detected. This study provides the first preliminary understanding of the oropharyngeal virome of T. brasiliensis, which may guide the discovery and isolation of novel viruses in the future and highlights the need for continuing investigations in this regard.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat feces have been reported in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) books to have the effect of reducing fever and improving eyesight, but the mechanism of vision improvement still needs further research. To this end, we used 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) to analyze the antioxidant capacity of and the types of vitamins in bat feces. We hoped to screen the pharmacological components of bat feces and to explain the role that these components may play in treating visual deterioration. Our results found that bat feces had a good antioxidant capacity and mainly contained vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (nicotinamide), B3 (nicotinic acid), and B5 (pantothenic acid). Although these vitamins may help to maintain the health of the optic nerve and cornea, the vitamin content of bat feces is low, but the heavy metal content is high, as shown using inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. Therefore, we suggest that the use of bat feces as TCM to improve vision should be strictly restricted.",

Here, results are described from our ongoing surveillance of these bats for coronaviruses. These findings show that group 1 coronaviruses are endemic in these bat populations in Hong Kong. Genetic analysis of these viruses indicates that there are at least four different, but closely related, group 1 coronaviruses (bat-CoV 1A, 1B, HKU7 and HKU8) circulating in bent-winged bats. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these group 1 bat coronaviruses have descended from a common ancestor and that these viruses have been established in these bats for a long period of time. These data provide a better understanding of the emergence and evolution of coronaviruses. Bat-CoV 1A and 1B were detected in apparently healthy Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus, respectively, on repeated sampling occasions at a single habitat, suggesting that these viruses have established a persistent infection in these populations.",

Here, we report the full genomic sequences of bat CoVs 1A, 1B and HKU8. Bat CoVs 1A and 1B, which are commonly found in the Miniopterus, are phylogenetically closely related. Using species-specific RT-PCR assays, bat CoVs 1A and 1B were confirmed to have distinct host specificities to Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus, respectively. Interestingly, co-infections of bat CoVs 1B and HKU8 in M. pusillus are detected in seven of 38 virus-positive specimens collected from 2004 to 2006. These findings highlight that co-infections of some coronaviruses might be common events in nature. The biological basis for the host restriction of bat coronaviruses, however, is yet to be determined.",

The interspecific relationships of these taxa, their colonization history, and the evolution of this presumed adaptive radiation have not been sufficiently explored. Using the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene, we present a phylogeny of the Malagasy members of this widespread Old World genus, based on 218 sequences, of which 82 are new and 136 derived from previous studies. Phylogenetic analyses recovered 18 clades, which divide into five primary lineages: (1) M. griveaudi; (2) M. mahafaliensis, M. sororculus and X3; (3) M. majori, M. gleni and M. griffithsi; (4) M. brachytragos; M. aelleniA, and M. aelleniB; and (5) M. manavi and M. petersoni recovered as sister species, which were in turn linked to a group comprising M. egeri and five genetically distinct populations referred to herein as P3, P4, P5, P6 and P7. Beast analysis indicated that the initial divergence within the Malagasy Miniopterus radiation took place 4.5 Myr; most species diverged between 4 and 2.5 Myr, and a secondary period was between 1.25 and 1 Myr. DNA K2Pdistances between recognized taxa ranged from 12.9% to 2.5% and intraspecific variation was less than 1.8%. Of the 18 identified clades, Latin binomials are only associated with 11, which indicates much greater differentiation than currently recognized for Malagasy Miniopterus. These data are placed in a context of the dispersal history of this genus on the island and patterns of ecological diversity.",

We address two main questions: (i) do parasites prefer vulnerable or well‐fed hosts, and (ii) to what extent is a parasite species specialized towards a given host species?\n                \n                \n                  \n                    To answer these questions, we investigated, both in the field and in the lab, a host–parasite system comprising one ectoparasitic mite (\n                    Spinturnix myoti\n                    ) and its major hosts, two sibling species of bats (\n                    Myotis myotis\n                    and\n                    M. blythii\n                    ), which coexist intimately in colonial nursery roosts. We exploited the close physical associations between host species in colonial roosts as well as naturally occurring annual variation in food abundance to investigate the relationships between parasite intensities and (i) host species and (ii) individual nutritional status.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Although horizontal transmission of parasites was facilitated by the intimate aggregation of bats within their colonial clusters, we found significant interspecific differences in degree of infestation throughout the 6 years of the study, with\n                    M. myotis\n                    always more heavily parasitized than\n                    M. blythii\n                    . This pattern was replicated in a laboratory experiment in which any species‐specific resistance induced by exploitation of different trophic niches in nature was removed.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Within both host species,\n                    S. myoti\n                    showed a clear preference for individuals with higher nutritional status. In years with high resource abundance, both bat hosts harboured more parasites than in low‐resource years, although the relative difference in parasite burden across species was maintained. This pattern of host choice was also replicated in the laboratory. When offered a choice, parasites always colonized better‐fed individuals.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  These results show first that host specialization in our study system occurred. Second, immediate parasite choice clearly operated towards the selection of hosts in good nutritional state.",

Divergence in ﬂowering phenology and selﬁng could also reduce interspeciﬁc crossing between self-compatible species. We investigated ﬂoral traits and visitation rates of pollinators of two sympatric Encholirium species on rocky outcrops to evaluate whether prior knowledge of ﬂoral characters could indicate actual pollinators. Data on ﬂowering phenology, visitation rates and breeding system were used to evaluate reproductive isolation. Flowering phenology overlapped between species, but there were differences in ﬂoral characters, nectar volume and concentration. Several hummingbird species visited ﬂowers of both Encholirium spp., but the endemic bat Lonchophylla bokermanni and an unidentiﬁed sphingid only visited E. vogelii. Pollination treatments demonstrated that E. heloisae and E. vogelii were partially self-compatible, with weak pollen limitation to seed set. Herbivores feeding on inﬂorescences decreased reproductive output of both species, but for E. vogelii the damage was higher. Our results indicate that actual pollinators can be known beforehand through ﬂoral traits, in agreement with pollination syndromes stating that a set of ﬂoral traits can be associated with the attraction of speciﬁc groups of pollinators. Divergence on ﬂoral traits and pollinator assemblage indicate that shifts in pollination strategies contribute to reproductive isolation between these Encholirium species, not divergence on ﬂowering phenology or selﬁng. We suggest that hummingbird pollination might be the ancestral condition in Encholirium and that evolution of bat pollination made a substantial contribution to the diversiﬁcation of this clade.",

This is especially problematic as they represent a substantial portion of undiscovered biodiversity, and have implications for not only species conservation, but even assaying potential risk of zoonotic spillover. Here, we use integrative approaches to delineate potential cryptic species in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae), evaluate the phenotypic disparities between cryptic species, and identify key traits for their identiﬁcation. We tested the use of multispecies coalescent models (MSC) using Bayesian Phylogenetic and Phylogeography (BPP) and found that BPP was useful in delineating potential cryptic species, and consistent with acoustic traits. Our results show that around 40% of Asian rhinolophid species are potentially cryptic and have not been formally described. In order to avoid potential misidentiﬁcation and allow species to be accurately identiﬁed, we identiﬁed quantitative noseleaf sella and acoustic characters as the most informative traits in delineating between potential cryptic species in Rhinolophidae. This highlights the physical differences between cryptic species that are apparent in noseleaf traits which often only qualitatively described but rarely measured. Each part of the noseleaf including the sella, lateral lappets, and lancet furrows, play roles in focusing acoustic beams and thus, provide useful characteristics to identify cryptic Rhinolophus species. Finally, species delimitation for cryptic species cannot rely on genetic data alone, but such data should be complemented by other evidence, including phenotypic, acoustic data, and geographic distributions to ensure accurate species identiﬁcation and delineation.",

In this study, we examined the variation in the intensities of a blood-sucking mite (Spinturnix myoti, Acarina) with respect to the reproductive cycle and immunocompetence of its host, the greater mouse-eared bat Myotis myotis. Reproductive, pregnant females were less immunocompetent and harboured more parasites than nonreproductive females, whilst, during lactation, immunocompetence was positively associated with female body mass. There was a dramatic increase in the T-cell response of gravid females with the advancement of gestation, which coincided with a diminution of individual parasite loads and a progressive switch of parasites from adults to juveniles. The latter not only harboured greater numbers of mites than adult female bats, but they also exhibited gravid parasites in higher proportions, indicating that juvenile hosts are more attractive for parasite reproduction than adult females.",

The plant most commonly used for tent construction was Anthurium ravenii (Araceae). Bats create a tent on A. ravenii by severing the basal 2 to 5 lateral nerves at a distance of 5 to 10 mm from the midrib; the entire margin of the leaf then collapses downward to form a pyramid-shaped tent. The number of altered leaves per plant ranges from 1 to 4 with a mean of 2.1. A. watsoni appears to be selecting leaves of medium size and low within the plant. The size, shape, and location of leaves selected is consistent with the hypothesis that tent construction provides bats with roost sites that will be available to them for a long period of time and provides protection from both predators and the elements, thus conveying a selective advantage to the bats.",

A new type of tent constructed by Peters's tent-making bat (Uroderma bilobatum) using multiple leaves of young Coccoloba manzanillensis and possibly Genipa americana on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, is reported. Bats constructed the conical tent resembling a tepee by severing the midribs of the lowermost leaves farthest from the tree trunk and those of the upper leaves gradually closer to the trunk. As a result, the upper leaves collapsed on top of the leaves directly below and the whole structure became tightly sealed. Bats used most or all leaves (range 6-14) in a tree, starting almost always from the bottommost leaf. The tent was occupied by a single, or occasionally two, adult male(s) hanging from one of the bottom three leaves. The structural ingenuity of the tent plus its sophisticated repair suggests a complex bat behaviour.",

This review aims to describe the 27 manifestations of Ebola virus that arose after its discovery in 1976. It provides an update on research on the ecology of Ebola viruses, modes of contamination and human transmission of the disease that are mainly linked to close contact with an infected animal or a patient suffering from the disease. The recommendations to contain the epidemic and challenges to achieve it are reminded.",

Gross ¢ndings, which were minimal, included poor body condition, bilateral renomegaly, and mottling of the liver. Histopathological lesions, which were particularly pronounced in the urogenital tract and liver, consisted primarily of in£ammation associated with intracytoplasmic microsporidian spores. Polymerase chain reaction based methods were used to establish the identity of the microsporidian as Encephalitozoon hellem. E. hellem is an emerging cause of human and avian disease, manifested mainly as opportunistic infection in immunosuppressed patients. This report describes the ¢rst documented case of E. hellem in a non-human mammalian species.",

            "abstractNote": "We explored the behavioral flexibility of Commissaris’s long-tongued bats through a spatial serial reversal foraging task. Bats kept in captivity for short periods were trained to obtain nectar rewards from two artificial flowers. At any given time, only one of the flowers provided rewards and these reward contingencies reversed in successive blocks of 50 flower visits. All bats detected and responded to reversals by making most of their visits to the currently active flower. As the bats experienced repeated reversals, their preference re-adjusted faster. Although the flower state reversals were theoretically predictable, we did not detect anticipatory behavior, that is, frequency of visits to the alternative flower did not increase within each block as the programmed reversal approached. The net balance of these changes was a progressive improvement in performance in terms of the total proportion of visits allocated to the active flower. The results are compatible with, but do not depend on, the bats displaying an ability to ‘learn to learn’ and show that the dynamics of allocation of effort between food sources can change flexibly according to circumstances.",

            "abstractNote": "Among bats, rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans, but not pteropodids, exhibit laryngeal echolocation. Although Rousettus has been regarded as the only pteropodid capable of echolocation using tongue clicks, recent evidence suggests that other species of pteropodids are also capable of echolocation using wing clicks. Studies on laryngeal echolocators suggest that delicate ear movements are essential for the echolocation behavior of bats and that the cervicoauricularis muscles play a critical role in such ear movements. In this study, we observed the gross anatomy of cervicoauricularis muscles in three species of pteropodids (Cynopterus sphinx, Eonycteris spelaea, and Rousettus leschenaultii) to examine whether ear muscle anatomy varies among pteropodids with different echolocation types and between pteropodids and laryngeal echolocating bats. We found that M. cervicoauricularis profundus originates from the nuchal crest in tongue-click echolocators (R. leschenaultii) and from the midline in wing-click echolocators (C. sphinx and E. spelaea). In general, tongue-click echolocation using high click rates is considered to be more sophisticated in terms of sonar performance than wing-click echolocation. M. cervicoauricularis profundus originating from the nuchal crest (CPNC) is not common in non-bat laurasiatherian mammals, but can be found in laryngeal echolocating bats. As it pulls the ear pinna caudally in the horizontal plane and increases the access to sound, CPNC found in R. leschenaultii and laryngeal echolocating bats may be a key characteristic of the sophisticated active echolocation behavior of bats.",

The discovery of this virus was soon followed by the discovery of the civet and bat SARS-CoV and the human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. Surveillance of coronaviruses in many animal species has increased the number on the list of coronaviruses to at least 36. The explosive nature of the first SARS epidemic, the high mortality, its transient reemergence a year later, and economic disruptions led to a rush on research of the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the virus and the disease. This research resulted in over 4,000 publications, only some of the most representative works of which could be reviewed in this article. The marked increase in the understanding of the virus and the disease within such a short time has allowed the development of diagnostic tests, animal models, antivirals, vaccines, and epidemiological and infection control measures, which could prove to be useful in randomized control trials if SARS should return. The findings that horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-like virus and that civets are the amplification host highlight the importance of wildlife and biosecurity in farms and wet markets, which can serve as the source and amplification centers for emerging infections.",

            "abstractNote": "The genera Cimex Linnaeus and Oeciacus Stål (Heteroptera: Cimicidae) are common haematophagous ectoparasites of bats or birds in the Holarctic region. Both their phylogenetic relationship and the systematics of the entire family previously were based on data from morphology and host relationships. Relationships among nine species of the genus Cimex and three species of the genus Oeciacus were analysed here using two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. Cimex was shown to be paraphyletic with respect to Oeciacus. Oeciacus is thus proposed as a synonym of Cimex. The characteristic phenotype of Oeciacus results from the specific host association with different species of swallows (Hirundinidae). The morphological characters that have been used as diagnostic for the genera were shown to be valid and can be further used for determination at species level. The present analyses recovered the four traditional morphologically defined species groups of the genus Cimex. However, their relationships were poorly resolved – only the C. hemipterus group showed a well-supported relationship to the C. pipistrelli group. The molecular differentiation within the Palaearctic C. pipistrelli and the Nearctic C. pilosellus species groups correlates with their karyotype differentiation. Furthermore, the analyses suggest poly- or paraphyly of the former genus Oeciacus. Either way this indicates there is a large amount of host-associated phenotypic convergence in either bat- or bird-associated groups of species. The probability of host choice and subsequent switch in Cimicidae are discussed and possible scenarios of the evolution of host association in species of Cimex are suggested.",

            "abstractNote": "Roost use by bats is likely affected by their water balance and thermoregulatory abilities. To test this hypothesis, we explored the relationship between 4 traits of different species of bats (body size, general food habits, taxonomic group, and thermoregulatory pattern) and microclimates at roosts (temperature and humidity). We recorded roost variables and presence of bats in 18 caves from 5 contrasting biomes in central Mexico. There was little evidence of microclimatic specificity among the 23 species studied, but maternity colonies used warmer roosts and hibernating bats used cooler roosts. Heterothermic species (Vespertilionidae) used colder caves with the widest temperature range (1.6–29.8°C), whereas homeothermic species (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, and Natalidae) occupied warmer roosts (14.5–37.5°C). Within these caves, precise (narrow body temperature range) homeotherms occupied slightly cooler roosts than more labile homeotherms. Body size alone was not associated with cave use patterns. However, when homeotherms and heterotherms were examined separately, body size and temperature were negatively correlated. The smallest homeothermic insectivorous species (&lt;10 g) consistently occupied roosts with temperatures &gt;20°C (more often &gt;25°C), whereas only the largest homeothermic insectivores were found as low as 16°C. Frugivorous, nectarivorous, and sanguivorous bats were found in a wide range of temperatures (14.5–37°C), but often at &lt;20°C. Humidity in roosts was highly variable for most species and we did not detect any trend regarding this factor. Our data suggest that the thermoregulatory ability resulting from the complex interaction of body size, type of food, and taxonomic affiliation constrains species with respect to types of roosts that they can successfully exploit. Our results support the hypothesis that temperature is the most important physical factor influencing roost selection in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Around 1000 species of bats in the world use echolocation to navigate, orient, and detect insect prey. Many of these bats emerge from their roost at dusk and start foraging when there is still light available. It is however unclear in what way and to which extent navigation, or even prey detection in these bats is aided by vision. Here we compare the echolocation and visual detection ranges of two such species of bats which rely on different foraging strategies (Rhinopoma microphyllum and Pipistrellus kuhlii). We ﬁnd that echolocation is better than vision for detecting small insects even in intermediate light levels (1–10 lux), while vision is advantageous for monitoring far-away landscape elements in both species. We thus hypothesize that, bats constantly integrate information acquired by the two sensory modalities. We suggest that during evolution, echolocation was reﬁned to detect increasingly small targets in conjunction with using vision. To do so, the ability to hear ultrasonic sound is a prerequisite which was readily available in small mammals, but absent in many other animal groups. The ability to exploit ultrasound to detect very small targets, such as insects, has opened up a large nocturnal niche to bats and may have spurred diversiﬁcation in both echolocation and foraging tactics.",

            "abstractNote": "Aerobic bacterial flora from the digestive tract of the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). This study addresses the composition of microbial flora in the vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) primarily because all available data are outdated, and because of the economical significance of this bat species. Twenty-one bats were collected and their aerobic bacteria documented separately for stomach and intestine. Bacteria were identified through the Analytical Profile Index (API), and results analyzed with the APILAB software. A total of thirty bacterial species were isolated from sixteen females and five males. The most common species were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, although other bacteria, such as Acinetobacter johnsonii, Enterobacter sakazakii, Staphylococcus chromogenes, S. hyicus and S. xylosus were also common. The number of species found in the stomach and intestine was significantly different, and the intestine presented a higher diversity compared to the stomach. This has previously been found in other mammals and it is attributed to a reduction of acidity. Most of the species found in this study are considered normal components of the digestive tract of mammals, although other bacteria common in the skin of mammals and from aquatic environments were found. Bacteria from the skin may invade the vampire’s stomach and/or intestine when the bat has contact with its prey, and may suggest that the vampire’s feeding habit facilitates the invasion of other microbes not common in its digestive tract. The fact that bacteria from aquatic environments were also found suggests that D. rotundus, as previously found by other researchers, drinks free water when available, and water may be another source of microbial invasion.

However, little is known about the role of this region in the diversification of bats though it harbors high chiropteran diversity. In this study, we used phenotypic, acoustic, and genetic markers to assess the diversification of Rhinolophus lepidus bats in South Asia. We first investigated if peninsular India is associated with speciation of R. lepidus. Further, we tested if the Palghat Gap acts as a biogeographic barrier to gene flow in this species. Our results revealed cryptic genetic diversity in peninsular India suggesting that this region holds at least one endemic species level lineage of the R. lepidus species complex. Analyses of populations of R. lepidus across the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats revealed clinal variation in phenotype, with bats south of this barrier being bigger and emitting echolocation calls of higher frequency. We also observed that populations on either side of the Palghat Gap have remained genetically isolated since the mid-Holocene.",

However, effective disease control in wildlife is challenging because feasible management options are often lacking. White‐nose syndrome (\n                    WNS\n                    ) is an infectious disease of hibernating bats that currently threatens several North American species with extinction. Currently, no effective treatments exist for\n                    WNS\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We conducted a laboratory experiment to test the efficacy of probiotic treatment with\n                    Pseudomonas fluorescens\n                    , a bacterium that naturally occurs on bats, to reduce disease severity and improve survival of little brown bats\n                    Myotis lucifugus\n                    exposed to\n                    Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n                    , the fungal pathogen that causes\n                    WNS\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We found that application of the probiotic bacteria at the time of fungal infection reduced several measures of disease severity and increased survival, whereas bacterial treatment prior to pathogen exposure had no effect on survival and worsened disease severity.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Our results suggest that probiotic treatment with\n                    Ps. fluorescens\n                    has potential for white‐nose syndrome disease management, but the timing of application is critical and should coincide with natural exposure of bats to\n                    P. destructans\n                    .

            "abstractNote": "While sound is a signal modality widely used by many animals, it is very susceptible to attenuation, hampering effective long-distance communication. A strategy to minimize sound attenuation that has been historically used by humans is to use acoustic horns; to date, no other animal is known to use a similar structure to increase sound intensity. Here, we describe how the use of a roosting structure that resembles an acoustic horn (the tapered tubes that form when new leaves of plants such as\n              Heliconia\n              or\n              Calathea\n              species start to unfurl) increases sound amplification of the incoming and outgoing social calls used by Spix's disc-winged bat (\n              Thyroptera tricolor\n              ) to locate roosts and group members. Our results indicate that incoming calls are significantly amplified as a result of sound waves being increasingly compressed as they move into the narrow end of the leaf. Outgoing calls were faintly amplified, probably as a result of increased sound directionality. Both types of call, however, experienced significant sound distortion, which might explain the patterns of signal recognition previously observed in behavioural experiments. Our study provides the first evidence of the potential role that a roost can play in facilitating acoustic communication in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "In bats, the wing membrane is anchored not only to the body and forelimb, but also to the hindlimb. This attachment configuration gives bats the potential to modulate wing shape by moving the hindlimb, such as by joint movement at the hip or knee. Such movements could modulate lift, drag, or the pitching moment. In this study we address: 1) how the ankle translates through space during the wingbeat cycle; 2) whether amplitude of ankle motion is dependent upon flight speed; 3) how tension in the wing membrane pulls the ankle; and 4) whether wing membrane tension is responsible for driving ankle motion. We flew five individuals of the lesser dog-faced fruit bat, Cynopterus brachyotis (Family: Pteropodidae), in a wind tunnel and documented kinematics of the forelimb, hip, ankle, and trailing edge of the wing membrane. Based on kinematic analysis of hindlimb and forelimb movements, we found that: 1) during downstroke, the ankle moved ventrally and during upstroke the ankle moved dorsally; 2) there was considerable variation in amplitude of ankle motion, but amplitude did not correlate significantly with flight speed; 3) during downstroke, tension generated by the wing membrane acted to pull the ankle dorsally, and during upstroke, the wing membrane pulled laterally when taut and dorsally when relatively slack; and 4) wing membrane tension generally opposed dorsoventral ankle motion. We conclude that during forward flight in C. brachyotis, wing membrane tension does not power hindlimb motion; instead, we propose that hindlimb movements arise from muscle activity and/or inertial effects.",

Understanding these interactions in bats, however, has proven difficult given their high mobility and nocturnal habits. For bats, roosts are a critical resource; thus, the study of agonistic behaviors associated with the use of these resources could provide valuable information to understand how and whether individuals monopolize them. Here, we used Thyroptera tricolor to study agonistic behaviors associated with access to a roosting resource. We experimentally studied the behavioral responses of focal groups when interacting with different intruders during the occupation of an ephemeral roosting resource. We found that T. tricolor responds more aggressively to intruders than to members of its own group, increasing the number of aggressive vocalizations. We also found differences in the rate of agonistic behaviors based on the identity of the intruders. Specifically, we observed that bats produced a large number of aggressive vocalizations when interacting with nearby intruders, supporting the “nasty neighbor” hypothesis. This study provided the first empirical evidence that aggressive vocalizations may serve as a mechanism to defend and maintain exclusive roosting sites in social groups of T. tricolor.",

However, large-scale patterns in its evolution are largely unstudied. Here, we address several fundamental questions about the origins of acoustic communication in terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods), using phylogenetic methods. We show that origins of acoustic communication are significantly associated with nocturnal activity. We find that acoustic communication does not increase diversification rates, a surprising result given the many speciation-focused studies of frog calls and bird songs. We also demonstrate that the presence of acoustic communication is strongly conserved over time. Finally, we find that acoustic communication evolved independently in most major tetrapod groups, often with remarkably ancient origins (~100–200 million years ago). Overall, we show that the role of ecology in shaping signal evolution applies to surprisingly deep timescales, whereas the role of signal evolution in diversification may not.",

Faecal samples from 248 individuals of 20 bat species were tested for partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of CoV and 57 faecal samples from eight bat species were tested positive. The highest detection rate of 44% for Scotophilus kuhlii, followed by 30% for Rhinolophus monoceros. Significantly higher detection rates of coronaviral RNA were found in female bats and Scotophilus kuhlii roosting in palm trees. Phylogenetic analysis classified the positive samples into SARS-related (SARSr) CoV, Scotophilus bat CoV 512 close to those from China and Philippines, and Miniopterus bat CoV 1A-related lineages. Coronaviral RNA was also detected in bat guano from Scotophilus kuhlii and Myotis formosus flavus on the ground and had potential risk for human exposure. Diverse bat CoV with zoonotic potential could be introduced by migratory bats and maintained in the endemic bat population in Taiwan.",

            "abstractNote": "Interactions among multiple species form complex networks of interdependences and are considered primary factors in the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Pteropodid bats are keystone species that provide important ecosystem services of pollination and seed dispersal in the tropics and subtropics. In this study, we investigated the utilization and preference of food resources by the insular frugivorous ﬂying fox Pteropus dasymallus. We found that ﬁg species constituted the major portion of the diet of the ﬂying fox (94.6%). When foraging, the ﬂying fox preferred seed ﬁgs from female trees over gall ﬁgs from male trees in functionally dioecious ﬁg species. Germination experiments showed a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of germination for ﬁg seeds in feces than those from pellets and ripe ﬁgs (feces: 80.2%, pellets: 23.4%, ripe ﬁgs: 32.9%). Considering the active selection of seed ﬁgs and avoidance of gall ﬁgs by foraging ﬂying foxes, we suggest that the abundance of seed ﬁgs accurately represents food availability for dioecy. This preference for seed ﬁgs or viable seeds can effectively promote the survival of pollinating wasps and might reinforce the evolution of dioecism in ﬁgs. In addition, the effects of gut passage on seed germination, in combination with the capacity of ﬂying foxes to travel long distances, may substantially contribute to the efﬁciency of ﬂying foxes as seed dispersers.",

            "abstractNote": "Roost switching is a common occurrence in bats, yet the causes and consequences of such behavior are poorly understood. In this study we explore the ecological correlates of roost ﬁdelity in the tent-making bat Artibeus watsoni, particularly focusing on the effect of sex, reproductive status, and roost availability using a three-factor general linear model (GLM). We estimated roost ﬁdelity of radio-tracked individuals and found that the GLM was signiﬁcant (R2 ¼ 0.72, F10,34 ¼ 8.91, p < 0.001). Signiﬁcant interaction terms were observed for relative roost availability and sex (F4,34 ¼ 16.96, p < 0.001), and relative roost availability and reproductive status (F6,34 ¼ 7.62, p < 0.001), indicating that variation in roost ﬁdelity among males and females, and among individuals under different breeding conditions, depended on relative roost availability at the site where they were radio-tracked. Individuals in areas of high roost availability exhibited lower roost ﬁdelity than those sampled in areas of lower roost availability. Females exhibited less roost ﬁdelity than males for all roost availability categories, but the difference between males and females was only signiﬁcant at high roost availability. The general pattern of decreased roost ﬁdelity as roost availability increased was also prevalent among individuals in different breeding conditions. Additionally, satellite males exhibited higher roost ﬁdelity than resident males in areas of low roost availability, and lactating females had higher roost ﬁdelity than non-breeding females in areas of medium roost availability. Our study thus demonstrates that sex, reproductive status, and roost availability all affect roost ﬁdelity in the tentmaking bat A. watsoni, and also suggests that roost availability is the most important factor inﬂuencing roost ﬁdelity in this bat, providing the ﬁrst quantitative evidence that roost ﬁdelity is correlated with roost abundance in a single species.",

            "abstractNote": "In this study we investigated the reproductive patterns and postnatal development in the tent-making bat Artibeus watsoni. We sampled two populations in the Golﬁto Wildlife Refuge and Corcovado National Park, south-western Costa Rica, from June 2003 to March 2005. Most females were pregnant during the months of January and June, and most were lactating in March and July, indicating that this species exhibits seasonal bimodal polyoestry, with the ﬁrst parturition peak occurring in February–March and the second in June–July. Additionally, we observed a postpartum oestrus following the ﬁrst parturition, but not after the second. Females entered oestrus again in November–December and had a gestation period of c. 3 months. A female-biased sex ratio of neonates was observed during the second parturition period, and young were born at 32 and 56% of their mothers’ body mass and length of forearm, respectively. Adult proportions in length of forearm were attained faster than adult proportions in body mass, and sustained ﬂight was only possible after 35 days of age, when pups had achieved 100 and 80% of adult length of forearm and body mass proportions, respectively. Weaning and roosting independence occurred when young were c. 30–40 days old, and young females appeared to remain close to their place of birth, at least for their ﬁrst mating period, whereas adult males were never recaptured near their birth site. In addition, sexual maturity was reached in as little as 3 months in females born during the ﬁrst parturition period, whereas females born during the second birth period in June–July seemed to reach maturity at 6 months of age. Our results show that A. watsoni belongs to the faster lane of the slow–fast continuum of life-history variation in bats, which may be attributed primarily to its roosting and feeding ecology.",
