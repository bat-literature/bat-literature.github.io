            "abstractNote": "Several holistic and interdisciplinary approaches exist to safeguard health. Three of the most influential concepts at the moment, One Health, EcoHealth, and Planetary Health, are analyzed in this paper, revealing similarities and differences at the theoretical conceptual level. These approaches may appear synonymous, as they all promote the underlying assumption of humans and other animals sharing the same planet and the same environmental challenges, infections and infectious agents as well as other aspects of physical—and possibly mental—health. However, we would like to illuminate the differences between these three concepts or approaches, and how the choice of terms may, deliberately or involuntary, signal the focus, and underlying values of the approaches. In this paper, we have chosen some proposed and well-known suggestions of definitions. In our theoretical analysis, we will focus on at least two areas. These are (1) the value of the potential scientific areas which could be included and (2) core values present within the approach. In the first area, our main concern is whether the approaches are interdisciplinary and whether the core scientific areas are assigned equal importance. For the second area, which is rather wide, we analyze core values such as biodiversity, health, and how one values humans, animals, and ecosystems. One Health has been described as either a narrow approach combining public health and veterinary medicine or as a wide approach as in the wide-spread “umbrella” depiction including both scientific fields, core concepts, and interdisciplinary research areas. In both cases, however, safeguarding the health of vertebrates is usually in focus although ecosystems are also included in the model. The EcoHealth approach seems to have more of a biodiversity focus, with an emphasis on all living creatures, implying that parasites, unicellular organisms, and possibly also viruses have a value and should be protected. Planetary Health, on the other hand, has been put forward as a fruitful approach to deal with growing threats in the health area, not least globally. We conclude that there are actually important differences between these three approaches, which should be kept in mind when using any of these terms.",

            "abstractNote": "In Brazil, studies focusing on reproductive biology and aspects of pollination in the genus Ruellia have demonstrated common characteristics such as pollination by hummingbird, the predominance of selffertility and spontaneous self-pollination. The objectives of this study were to describe the ﬂoral biology, nectar production, the reproductive system, the effect of pollination intensity and ﬂowering phenology of Ruellia angustiﬂora, as well as keeping a record of the hummingbirds that visit the ﬂowers of this species. Data collection was performed in a stretch of the Salobrinha stream in the Serra da Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, from August 2005 to July 2006. R. angustiﬂora ﬂowered throughout most of the study period; it has diurnal anthesis and has increased nectar production in the morning hours with decreasing production rates during the day. The results of the reproduction experiments indicate self-fertility and pollen limitation in R. angustiﬂora. Among experiments with different pollination intensity there was no signiﬁcant difference in fruit formation. Four hummingbird species were observed visiting the ﬂowers of R. angustiﬂora, and Phaethornis pretrei was the most frequent followed by females of Thalurania furcata. According to its behavior and frequency of visits, P. pretrei can be considered the main pollinator of R. angustiﬂora in the study area. The experiments on ﬂowers treated with different pollen loads indicate that most successful fruit formation in this species is obtained in ﬂowers that received greater pollen loads on their stigmas. Besides, data suggest that major success in fruit set could be reached with more than three visits of P. pretrei.",

            "abstractNote": "The likelihood that a plant's seeds will be dispersed by fruit-eating birds may depend upon the size and shape of its fruits. Assuming that elongate fruits can be swallowed more easily than spherical fruits of equal volume and that plant fitness is enhanced by seed dispersal by many individuals and species of birds, natural selection should favour increasing fruit elongation with increasing fruit size in bird-dispersed plants. According to this view, this allometric pattern would be adaptive. Alternatively, fruit shape in birddispersed plants may be constrained by development or phylogeny. To determine whether there was any evidence to support the adaptive allometry hypothesis, we examined allometrie relationships between length and diameter in fruits and seeds in a group of neotropical bird-dispersed plant species. Using the major axis technique, we regressed In(diameter) on In(length) for fruits and seeds at various taxonomic levels: (1) within individual trees of Ocotea tenera (Lauraceae) (2) among 19 trees within a population of O. tenera, as well as among pooled fruits from multiple trees within 20 other species in the Lauraceae, (3) among 25 sympatric species within a plant family (Lauraceae) and (4) among 167 species representing 63 angiosperm families within a plant community in Monteverde, Costa Rica. At most taxonomic levels, a tendency for fruit length to increase more rapidly than fruit diameter among fruits (negative allometry) occurred more frequently than expected by chance. Estimated slopes of the regressions of fruit length on fruit diameter were < 1 within 15 of the 19 individual O. tenera trees, among tree means within O. tenera, among pooled fruits within 16 of the 20 other species in the Lauraceae, among species means within the Lauraceae and among means of all bird-dispersed species in the lower montane forests of Monteverde. Seed allometry showed similar patterns, although for both fruits and seeds the broad confidence intervals of the slopes estimated by major axis regression overlapped 1 in many cases. Among the 63 Monteverde family means, fruit length and diameter scaled isometrically. Based on measurements of ontogenetic changes in fruit shape in a single species, O. viridifolia, we found no evidence that negative allometry in fruit shape within the Lauraceae was an inevitable consequence of developmental constraints. Instead, increasing elongation of fruits and seeds in certain plant taxa is consistent with adaptation to gape-limited avian seed dispersers. Contrary results from vertebrate-dispersed species from Malawi and Spain may reflect differences between the New and Old World in plant taxa, seed dispersers or evolutionary history.",

The aim of the present multi-year study was to assess eﬀects of a WWTP replacement on bioactive chemical (BC) concentrations. Water samples were collected bimonthly, pre- and post-replacement, at 11 sites along the Colorado River upstream and downstream of the WWTP and analyzed for in vitro bioactivities (e.g., agonism of ER, GR, and PPARγ) and BC concentrations; fathead minnows were cage deployed pre- and post-replacement at sites with varying proximities to the WWTP. Before the WWTP replacement, in vitro ER (24 ng 17β-estradiol equivalents/L)-, GR (60 ng dexamethasone equivalents/L)-, and PPARγ-mediated activities were detected at the WWTP outﬂow but diminished downstream. In March 2018, the WWTP eﬄuent was acutely toxic to the ﬁsh, likely due to elevated ammonia concentrations. Following the WWTP replacement, ER, GR, and PPARγ bioactivities were reduced by approximately 60−79%, no toxicity was observed in caged ﬁsh, and there were marked decreases in concentrations of many BCs. Results suggest that replacement of the Moab WWTP achieved a signiﬁcant reduction in BC concentrations to the Colorado River.",

            "abstractNote": "The rapid growth in the number of older Americans has many implications for public health, including the need to better understand the risks posed to older adults by environmental exposures. Biologic capacity declines with normal aging; this may be exacerbated in individuals with pre-existing health conditions. This decline can result in compromised pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to environmental exposures encountered in daily activities. In recognition of this issue, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing a research agenda on the environment and older adults. The U.S. EPA proposes to apply an environmental public health paradigm to better understand the relationships between external pollution sources → human exposures → internal dose → early biologic effect → adverse health effects for older adults. The initial challenge will be using information about aging-related changes in exposure, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic factors to identify susceptible subgroups within the diverse population of older adults. These changes may interact with speciﬁc diseases of aging or medications used to treat these conditions. Constructs such as “frailty” may help to capture some of the diversity in the older adult population. Data are needed regarding a) behavior/activity patterns and exposure to the pollutants in the microenvironments of older adults; b) changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion with aging; c) alterations in reserve capacity that alter the body’s ability to compensate for the effects of environmental exposures; and d) strategies for effective communication of risk and risk reduction methods to older individuals and communities. This article summarizes the U.S. EPA’s development of a framework to address and prioritize the exposure, health effects, and risk communications concerns for the U.S.",

Environmental scientists coined the term “exposome” with the goal of inventorying and quantifying environmental exposures as precisely as scientists measure genes and gene expression. To date, the exposome’s proponents have not thoroughly engaged social scientific theoretical and methodological expertise, although the exclusion of sociological expertise risks molecularizing complex social phenomena and limiting the possibility of collective action to improve environmental conditions. As a corrective, and to demonstrate how “omic” technologies could be made more relevant to public health, our socio-exposome framework blends insights from sociological and public health research with insights from environmental justice scholarship and activism. We argue that environmental health science requires more comprehensive data on more and different kinds of environmental exposures, but also must consider the socio-political conditions and inequalities that allow hazards to continue unchecked. We propose a multidimensional framework oriented around three axes: individual, local, and global, and suggest some sociomarkers and data sources that could identify exposures at each level. This framework could also guide policy, by creating a predictive framework that helps communities understand the repercussions of corporate and regulatory practices for public health and social justice.",

            "abstractNote": "Wind energy is growing worldwide as a source of power generation. Bat assemblages may be negatively affected by wind farms due to the fatality of a signiﬁcant number of individuals after colliding with the moving turbines or experiencing barotrauma. The implementation of wind farms should follow standard procedures to prevent such negative impacts: avoid, reduce and offset, in what is known as the mitigation hierarchy. According to this approach avoiding impacts is the priority, followed by the minimisation of the identiﬁed impacts, and ﬁnally, when residual negative impacts still remain, those must be offset or at least compensated. This paper presents a review on conservation measures for bats and presents some guidelines within the compensation scenario, focusing on negative impacts that remain after avoidance and minimisation measures. The conservation strategies presented aim at the improvement of the ecological conditions for the bat assemblage as a whole. While developed under the European context, the proposed measures are potentially applicable elsewhere, taking into consideration the speciﬁcity of each region in terms of bat assemblages present, landscape features and policy context regarding nature and biodiversity conservation and management. An analysis of potential opportunities and constraints arising from the implementation of offset/compensation programmes and gaps in the current knowledge is also considered.",

Manufacturers have replaced select chemistries (“legacy” PFAS) with PFAS with shorter biological half-lives (e.g., GenX, perfluorobutanoate [PFBA]) which may efficiently eliminate in urine. However, knowledge regarding exposure to these compounds is limited. We analyzed 2,682 urine samples for 17 legacy and alternative PFAS from 2013–2014 NHANES participants ≥6 years of age. Concentrations of some of these PFAS, measured previously in paired serum samples from the same NHANES participants, suggested universal exposure to PFOS and PFOA, and infrequent or no exposure to two short-chain PFAS, perfluorobutane sulfonate and perfluoroheptanoate. Yet, in urine, PFAS were seldom detected; the frequency of not having detectable concentrations of any of the 17 PFAS was 67.5%. Only two were detected in more than 1.5% of the population: PFBA (13.3%) and perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA, 22.6%); the 90th percentile urine concentrations were 0.1 μg/L (PFBA), and 0.3 μg/L (PFHxA). These results suggest that exposures to short-chain PFAS are infrequent or at levels below those that would result in detectable concentrations in urine. As such, these findings do not support biomonitoring of short-chain PFAS or fluorinated alternatives in the general population using urine, and highlight the importance of selecting the adequate biomonitoring matrix.",

This sign (human plus commensal microbiota) forms the human superorganism. The worldwide emergence of an epidemic of chronic diseases has caused increased healthcare costs, increased premature mortality and reduced quality of life for a majority of the world’s population. In addition, it has raised questions concerning the interactions between humans and their environment and potential imbalances. Misregulated inflammation, a host defensehomeostasis disorder, appears to be a key biomarker connecting a majority of chronic diseases. We consider the apparent contributors to this disorder that promote a web of interlinked comorbid conditions. Three key events are suggested to play a role: (1) altered epigenetic programming (AEP) that may span multiple generations, (2) developmental immunotoxicity (DIT), and (3) failure to adequately incorporate commensal microbes as a newborn (i.e., the incomplete self). We discuss how these three events can combine to determine whether the human superorganism is able to adequately and completely form during early childhood. We also discuss how corruption of this event can affect the risk of later-life diseases.",

Plant biologists have long speculated that outcrossing mating systems are more common at low than high latitudes owing to a greater predictability of plant–pollinator interactions in the tropics; however, these ideas have not previously been tested. Here, we present the ﬁrst global biogeographic analysis of plant mating systems based on 624 published studies from 492 taxa. We found a weak decline in outcrossing rate towards higher latitudes and among some biomes, but no biogeographic patterns in the frequency of self-incompatibility. Incorporating life history and growth form into biogeographic analyses reduced or eliminated the importance of latitude and biome in predicting outcrossing or self-incompatibility. Our results suggest that biogeographic patterns in mating system are more likely a reﬂection of the frequency of life forms across latitudes rather than the strength of plant–pollinator interactions.",

However, effects of biocontrol services on tropical cash crop yield are still largely unknown. For the ﬁrst time, we manipulated the access of birds and bats in an exclosure experiment (day, night and full exclosures compared to open controls in Indonesian cacao agroforestry) and quantiﬁed the arthropod communities, the fruit development and the ﬁnal yield over a long time period (15 months). We found that bat and bird exclusion increased insect herbivore abundance, despite the concurrent release of mesopredators such as ants and spiders, and negatively affected fruit development, with ﬁnal crop yield decreasing by 31% across local (shade cover) and landscape (distance to primary forest) gradients. Our results highlight the tremendous economic impact of common insectivorous birds and bats, which need to become an essential part of sustainable landscape management.",

            "abstractNote": "Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the speciﬁc aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be conﬁdent about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The ﬁrst, the number of functional groups or types, has signiﬁcant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about speciesÕ abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-signiﬁcant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such\n              mobile‐agent‐based ecosystem service\n              (MABES), pollination, is affected by land‐use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal‐mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service‐providing organisms depend. About one‐third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60–90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market‐based forces to influence land‐use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.",

Yet ecological understanding of ecosystem services is quite limited. Previous work maps the supply and demand for services, assesses threats to them, and estimates economic values, but does not measure the underlying role of biodiversity in providing services. In contrast, experimental studies of biodiversity–function examine communities whose structures often differ markedly from those providing services in real landscapes. A bridge is needed between these two approaches. To develop this research agenda, I discuss critical questions and key approaches in four areas: (1) identifying the important Ôecosystem service providersÕ; (2) determining the various aspects of community structure that inﬂuence function in real landscapes, especially compensatory community responses that stabilize function, or non-random extinction sequences that rapidly erode it; (3) assessing key environmental factors inﬂuencing provision of services, and (4) measuring the spatio-temporal scale over which providers and services operate. I show how this research agenda can assist in developing environmental policy and natural resource management plans.",

These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant–pollinator and 24 plant–frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant–animal mutualistic networks (65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant–animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.",

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience ‘rivet-like’ thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These ﬁndings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.",

However, a recent review shows that it is generalization that prevails in the field, with most plants having a number of pollinators and most pollinators visiting a number of plants. Consequently, the vast majority of plant± pollinator interactions are embedded in a complex web of plant±pollinator interactions. These plant-pollinator webs can be studied in the manner of conventional food webs and the aim of this paper is to illustrate how contemporary methods of web construction and analysis can be applied to plant-pollinator communities.",

While theorists use RA schedules as the connection between life history and energy allocation, little is known about RA schedules in real vegetation. Here we review what is known about RA schedules for perennial plants using studies either directly quantifying RA or that collected data from which the shape of an RA schedule can be inferred. We also brieﬂy review theoretical models describing factors by which variation in RA may arise. We identiﬁed 34 studies from which aspects of an RA schedule could be inferred. Within those, RA schedules varied considerably across species: some species abruptly shift all resources from growth to reproduction; most others gradually shift resources into reproduction, but under a variety of graded schedules. Available data indicate the maximum fraction of energy allocated to production ranges from 0.1 to 1 and that shorter lived species tend to have higher initial RA and increase their RA more quickly than do longer-lived species. Overall, our ﬁndings indicate, little data exist about RA schedules in perennial plants. Available data suggest a wide range of schedules across species. Collection of more data on RA schedules would enable a tighter integration between observation and a variety of models predicting optimal energy allocation, plant growth rates, and biogeochemical cycles.",

            "abstractNote": "Emergence of the metacommunity concept has made a substantial contribution to better understanding of the community composition and dynamics in a regional context. However, long-term ﬁeld data for testing of available metacommunity models are still scarce, and the extent to which these models apply to the real world remains unknown. Tests conducted so far have largely sought to ﬁt data on the entire regional set of species to one of several metacommunity models, implicitly assuming that all species operate similarly over the same set of sites. However, species differ in their habitat use. These differences can, in the most general terms, be expressed as a gradient of habitat specialization (ranging from habitat specialists to habitat generalists). We postulate that such differences in habitat specialization will have implications for metacommunity dynamics. Speciﬁcally, we predict that specialists respond more to local processes and generalists respond to regional spatial processes. We tested these predictions using natural microcosm communities for which long-term (nine-year) environmental and population dynamics data were available. We used redundancy analysis to determine the proportion of variation explained by environmental and spatial factors. We repeated this analysis to explain variation in the entire regional set of species, in generalist species only, and in specialists only. We further used ANOVA to test for differences in the proportions of explained variation. We found that habitat specialists responded primarily to environmental factors and habitat generalists responded mainly to spatial factors. Thus, from the metacommunity perspective, the dynamics of habitat specialists are best explained by a combination of species sorting and mass effects, while that of habitat generalists are best explained by patch dynamics and neutral models. Consequently, we infer that a natural metacommunity can exhibit complicated dynamics, with some groups of species (e.g., habitat specialists) governed according to environmental processes and other groups (e.g., habitat generalists) governed mainly by dispersal processes.",

            "abstractNote": "Many plants interact with groups of mutualist pollinators and seed dispersers. A key issue for both basic ecology and conservation is whether the different species within these guilds of mutualist animals are functionally equivalent. Comparing the relative effects of sympatric mutualists is important for understanding the evolution of multispecies mutualisms and for predicting mutualism stability in the face of anthropogenic change. However, empirical comparisons of the population-level impacts of mutualist animals on their host plant are rare, particularly for seed dispersal mutualisms in species-rich ecosystems. We compared the inﬂuence of three seed-dispersing tropical mammals, lar gibbons (Hylobates lar), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and red muntjac deer (Muntiacus muntjak), on the demography of a shared host tree in Thailand, Choerospondias axillaris (Anacardiaceae). Sambar and muntjac dispersed far more C. axillaris seeds than did gibbons. While sambar deposited many seeds under female tree canopies, muntjac were the only disperser to move seeds to open microhabitats, where C. axillaris seed germination, seedling survival, and initial growth are enhanced. Using stage-based population models, we assessed how disperser-speciﬁc seed dispersal, variation in the frequency of canopy gap formation, and their interaction inﬂuenced the potential population growth of C. axillaris. Large differences in dispersal quantity and small differences in dispersal quality among sambar and gibbons resulted in similar and negligible impacts on the tree’s population dynamics. Muntjac, by taking some of the seeds to open microhabitats, are projected to have a greater positive impact on C. axillaris demography than either sambar or gibbons. Model comparisons of population-level species impacts may allow us to predict which ecological interactions are at risk from loss of critical species.",

Still, the general distribution of consumer–resource body-size ratios in real ecosystems, and whether they vary systematically among habitats or broad taxonomic groups, is poorly understood. Using a unique global database on consumer and resource body sizes, we show that the mean bodysize ratios of aquatic herbivorous and detritivorous consumers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of carnivorous predators. Carnivorous predator–prey body-size ratios vary across different habitats and predator and prey types (invertebrates, ectotherm, and endotherm vertebrates). Predator–prey body-size ratios are on average signiﬁcantly higher (1) in freshwater habitats than in marine or terrestrial habitats, (2) for vertebrate than for invertebrate predators, and (3) for invertebrate than for ectotherm vertebrate prey. If recent studies that relate body-size ratios to interaction strengths are general, our results suggest that mean consumer–resource interaction strengths may vary systematically across different habitat categories and consumer types.",

            "abstractNote": "One view of pollination systems is that they tend toward specialization. This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant—pollinator coevolution and in the long—standing concept of\n              p\n              ollination syndromes. But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest. To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in\n              p\n              henotype space, there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior and morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the\n              c\n              orrect\" pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information—processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.",

So far, this model has only been tested within individual species, i.e., among animals of similar physiology and life history. I tested the model across multiple species, using a taxonomically diverse community of arthropods found on exposed tree trunks in northern Germany. I sampled 14 arthropod species from different microhabitat types (various cryptogam species and crevice types) and quantified the microhabitat-niche breadths of species by Simpson index. Then, I used multiple regression analysis across phylogenetically independent contrasts to examine the relationship between microhabitat-niche breadth and traits that can control search time (degree of residence on the trunks, tolerance of abiotic stress, speed of movement, generation time). I found that microhabitat specialists had longer generation times, spent more of their life on the trunks and could move faster than generalists. This allowed specialists to search the trunk for a longer period of time than generalists and to require less time to traverse a given search distance. These three findings supported the TimeLimited Disperser Model. However, specialists were no more tolerant of abiotic stress (i.e., desiccation) than were generalists. That is, specialists could not search the trunk during more adverse climatic conditions than could generalists, contradicting the Time-Limited Disperser Model. Overall, the results supported three out of four predictions of the TimeLimited Disperser Model at an interspecific level. Specialists can search for a long time; generalists are pressed for time.",

            "abstractNote": "We present a model to examine how foragers should divide attention among different potential prey types in order to maximize their net rate of energy intake. We define attention as the brain's capacity to process information simultaneously. Our model is based on neuropsychological studies suggesting first, that predators who divide attention among an increasing number of different prey types decrease their ability to detect any given type, and second, that this decrease is larger when prey items are more difficult to detect. Our model also incorporates the effects of search rate on forager's probability to detect prey. The model predicts that foragers encountering cryptic prey should devote all attention to a single prey type. When encountering conspicuous prey, foragers should divide attention among the different prey types. For prey types that differ in conspicuousness but are equal in energy content, handling time, and density, foragers should give more attention to the more conspicuous prey if the conspicuousness values of all prey types are relatively small. However, when all prey are more conspicuous, foragers should devote more attention to the less conspicuous prey type. We suggest that our model may serve to explain and predict some of the foraging decisions of animals searching for cryptic or conspicuous prey, and especially studies on \"search image\" formation.",

Both predictions are confirmed in an examination of 57 species of subalpine meadow plants from the Colorado Rocky Mountains.",

To clarify and simplify the wide variety of terms used to describe aspects of temporal pattern, simple measures of predictability, constancy, and contingency are proposed. These are sufficient to describe the general characteristics of periodic phenomena. The measures are based on the mathematics of information theory. Methods of testing the statistical significance of these measures are given. Predictability, constancy, and contingency can be determined for either qualitative (categorical) or quantitative (discrete or continuous) variables measured over a period of time. Alternative patterns of seasonal flowering and fruiting of tropical trees are given as an example of a qualitative variable; precipitation data are analyzed as an example of a quantitative variable.",

            "abstractNote": "The Leuser Ecosystem in Northern Sumatra is officially protected by its status as an Indonesian national park. Nevertheless, it remains under severe threat of deforestation. Rainforest destruction has already caused a decline in ecological functions and services. Besides, it is affecting numerous economic activities in and around the Leuser National Park. The objectives of this study are twofold: firstly, to determine the total economic value (TEV) of the Leuser Ecosystem through a systems dynamic model. And secondly, to evaluate the economic consequences of deforestation versus conservation, disaggregating the economic value for the main stakeholders and regions involved. Using a dynamic simulation model, economic valuation is applied to evaluate the TEV of the Leuser National Park over the period 2000 Á/2030. Three scenarios are considered: ‘conservation’, ‘deforestation’ and, ‘selective use’. The results are presented in terms of (1) the type of benefits, (2) the allocation of these benefits among stakeholders, and (3) the regional distribution of benefits. The economic benefits considered include: water supply, fisheries, flood and drought prevention, agriculture and plantations, hydro-electricity, tourism, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, fire prevention, non-timber forest products, and timber. The stakeholders include: local community members, the local government, the logging and plantation industry, the national government, and the international community. The regions considered cover the 11 districts involved in the management of the Leuser Ecosystem. With a 4% discount rate, the accumulated TEV for the ecosystem over the 30-year period is: US $7.0 billion under the ‘deforestation scenario’, US $9.5 billion under the ‘conservation scenario’ and US $9.1 billion under the ‘selective utilisation scenario’. The main contributors in the conservation and selective use scenarios are water supply, flood prevention, tourism and agriculture. Timber revenues play an important role in the deforestation scenario. Compared to deforestation, conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem benefits all categories of stakeholders, except for the elite logging and plantation industry.",

The principal nonterritorial species (Clrlorostilbon canh.etii), which Amuzilia usually excluded from rich resources, traplined dispersed flowers and interfered with foraging patterns of other nonterritorial species. The 12 additional hummingbird species that foraged in the study habitats included species important in nearby communities, specialists on particular resources, and highly migratory opportunists.",

However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels [7–9]. We applied a recently developed [10] quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating signiﬁcantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were signiﬁcantly more specialized than seeddispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions.",

            "abstractNote": "Vultures provide critical ecosystem services, yet populations of many species have collapsed worldwide. We present the ﬁrst estimates of a 30-year PanAfrican vulture decline, conﬁrming that declines have occurred on a scale broadly comparable with those seen in Asia, where the ecological, economic, and human costs are already documented. Populations of eight species we assessed had declined by an average of 62%; seven had declined at a rate of 80% or more over three generations. Of these, at least six appear to qualify for uplisting to Critically Endangered. Africa’s vultures are facing a range of speciﬁc threats, the most signiﬁcant of which are poisoning and trade in traditional medicines, which together accounted for 90% of reported deaths. We recommend that national governments urgently enact and enforce legislation to strictly regulate the sale and use of pesticides and poisons, to eliminate the illegal trade in vulture body parts, as food or medicine, and to minimize mortality caused by power lines and wind turbines.",

Representatives from 21 international organizations, regional sections and working groups of the Society for Conservation Biology, and 12 academics, from all continents except Antarctica, compiled 2291 questions of relevance to conservation of biological diversity worldwide. The questions were gathered from 761 individuals through workshops, email requests, and discussions. Voting by email to short-list questions, followed by a 2-day workshop, was used to derive the final list of 100 questions. Most of the final questions were derived through a process of modification and combination as the workshop progressed. The questions are divided into 12 sections: ecosystem functions and services, climate change, technological change, protected areas, ecosystem management and restoration, terrestrial ecosystems, marine ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems, species management, organizational systems and processes, societal context and change, and impacts of conservation interventions. We anticipate that these questions will help identify new directions for researchers and assist funders in directing funds.",

We developed 2 simple, rapid-assessment models of the susceptibility of species to habitat loss. We based both on an index of range size, but one also incorporated an index of body mass and the other an index combining habitat and dietary specialization. We applied the models to samples of birds (Accipitridae and Bucerotidae) and to the lemurs of Madagascar and compared the models’ classifications of risk with the IUCN’s global threat status of each species. The model derived from ecological attributes was much more robust than the one derived from body mass. Ecological attributes identified threatened birds and lemurs with an average of 80% accuracy and endangered and critically endangered species with 100% accuracy and identified some species not currently listed as threatened that almost certainly warrant conservation consideration. Appropriate analysis of even fairly crude biological information can help raise early-warning flags to the relative susceptibilities of species to habitat loss and thus provide a useful and rapid technique for highlighting potential species-level conservation issues. Advantages of this approach to classifying risk include flexibility in the specialization parameters used as well as its applicability at a range of spatial scales.",

Nevertheless, many claims that a certain taxonomic group can provide more-general information on environmental quality are not evaluated critically. To address several of the many definitions of indicator species, we used butterflies to explore in some detail the attributes that affect implementation of indicators generically. There probably are few individual species, or sets of species, that can serve as scientifically valid, cost-effective measures of the status or trend of an environmental phenomenon that is difficult to measure directly. Nevertheless, there are species with distributions, abundances, or demographic characteristics that are responsive to known environmental changes. In this context, single or multiple species can serve as indicators when targets are defined explicitly, ecological relationships between the target and the putative indicators are well understood, and data are sufficient to differentiate between deterministic and stochastic responses. Although these situations exist, they are less common than might be apparent from an extensive and often confounded literature on indicators. Instead, the public appeal of charismatic groups may be driving much of their acclaim as indicators. The same taxon may not be appropriate for marketing a general conservation mission and for drawing strong inference about specific environmental changes. To provide insights into the progress of conservation efforts, it is essential to identify scientific and practical criteria for selection and application of indicators and then to examine whether a given taxonomic group meets those criteria.",

            "abstractNote": "Evaluating the degree of disturbance of any region to determine its relative importance for conservation purposes requires procedures that are relatively inexpensive and that yield accurate results fast. Because bats are abundant, diverse, and easy to sample, especially in the Neotropical rainforest, they fulfill several of the requirements of indicator species as identified in the literature. For 10 months we sampled bat communities in the Selva Lacandona in Chiapas, Mexico, at 15 sites representing five habitats. We also measured 10 variables representing vegetation structure and diversity at each site. With fuzzy-set techniques we produced a gradient classification of disturbance for the 15 sites based on the vegetation data. We explored the relationship between vegetation conditions, described as the membership degrees in the construct “fuzzy forest set” (the complementary fuzzy set of “disturbance”), and four bat community variables. Bat species richness, number of rare bat species, and the bat diversity index were positively correlated with the vegetation scores, and relative abundance of the most abundant bat species was negatively correlated with vegetation scores. A high number of phyllostomine species in a community is a good indicator of low levels of disturbance. Although a single indicator group will probably not be sufficient for decision-making processes in conservation, evaluating bat populations may be a good first step in assessing an area’s conservation value, especially in rainforest regions.",

Whether or not it is achieved will be judged by a set of biodiversity indicators now under development. We reviewed the development of these indicators in Europe and globally, paying particular attention to the need to make the indicators relevant to the purpose; to distinguish between measures of pressure, state, and response; to design and validate the indicators in context; to ensure effective communication with relevant audiences; to turn lists of measures into simple or composite indicators; and to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the indicator process. We conclude that urgent steps are needed to complete the indicator set, reduce and refine the agreed measures, ensure that work is started soon so that reliable reporting occurs in 2010, and start soon on planning for subsequent assessments.",

            "abstractNote": "Confusion over the term ecological redundancy (Walker 1992) requires that the concept be clarified in order to advance the developing theory that maintaining ecosystem function conserves biological diversity. The species approach to conserving biological diversity assumes that the species in trouble are already identified. The ecosystem approach attempts to deal with the problem of conserving all the species in an ecosystem, including those not yet known. This is best achieved by ensuring that the ecosystem continues to function approximately as it has by maintaining its essential structure. Ecosystem stability (the probability of all species persisting) is enhanced if each important functional group of organisms (important for maintaining function and structure) comprises several ecologically equivalent species, each with different responses to environmental factors. In this sense ecological redundancy is good because it enhances ecosystem resilience, but functionally important groups (guilds, functional types) that have only one or very few species deserve priority conservation attention because their functions could be quickly lost with species extinctions.\n          , \n            La confusión existente sobre el término redundancia ecológica (ver Walker 1992) hace necesario que el concepto sea clarificado a efecto de avanzar en la teoría actualmente en desarrollo sobre el mantenimiento de la función ecosistémica que conserva la diversidad biológica. La estrategia en términos de especie para conservar la diversidad biológica asume que la especie en problemas ya ha sido identificada. La estrategia ecosistémica intenta abordar el problema de conservar todas las especies dentro de un ecosistema, incluyendo aquellas que todavía no son conocidas. La mejor forma de alcanzar esta meta es asegurando que el ecositema continúe funcionando aproximadamente de la misma forma en que lo ha hecho y manteniendo su estructura escencial. La estabilidad ecosistémica (la probabilidad de que todas las especies persistan) es aumentada si cada grupo funcional importante de organismos (importantes para el mantenimiento de la función y estructura), comprende varias especies ecológicamente equivalentes, cada una con repuestas diferentes a los factores ambientales. En este sentido, la redundancia ecológica es buena porque aumenta la resiliencia ecositémica, pero los grupos funcionales importantes (gremios, tipos funcionales) que tienen sólo unas pocas o una sóla especie merecen atención con respecto a la conservación prioritaria, porque sus funciones podrían ser rapidamente perdidas con las extinciones de especies.",

We assessed DNA damage as a potential metric that could be a more integrative stress measurement with direct links to health. We captured free-living house sparrows, took an immediate blood sample, and transferred them to the laboratory, exposing them to the chronic stress of captivity. Biweekly blood and weight samples were then taken for 4 weeks. We immediately assessed DNA damage in red blood cells using the comet assay and later quantiﬁed corticosterone. Uric acid was analyzed in a separate group of birds. We found that birds initially lost, but began to regain weight over the course of captivity. DNA damage peaked within the ﬁrst 10 days of captivity, and mostly remained elevated. However, the cellular distribution of damage changed considerably over time; most cells showed low levels of damage early, a bimodal distribution of high and low DNA damage during the peak of damage, and a wide unimodal distribution of damage at the end of the 4 weeks. Furthermore, corticosterone increased and remained elevated and uric acid decreased and remained depleted over the same period. Although both a molecular (DNA damage) and an endocrine (corticosterone) marker showed similar response proﬁles over the 4 weeks, they were not correlated, suggesting they reﬂect diﬀerent aspects of the underlying physiology. These data provide convincing preliminary evidence that DNA damage has potential to be an additional indicator of chronic stress.",
