            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT \n              The ability to measure body composition is critical for studying the physiological ecology of animals. This is particularly true for small mammals that have a high metabolic rate. We evaluated a nondestructive method of body composition analysis that would allow accurate assessment of body fat, body water, and lean mass. We used total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) to estimate body composition in the little brown myotis (\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              ). In a sample of 46 individuals, TOBEC was both accurate and precise in estimating total body water and lean mass but was less effective at estimating total body fat. Mass‐independent or whole‐body compartments (i.e., total body water, total body fat, lean dry mass, and lean body mass) were more accurately estimated than mass‐dependent or mass‐specific body composition compartments (i.e., water content, fat index, and % lean dry mass). The TOBEC measurements we made using an SA‐3000 analyzer were influenced by extremes in body temperature, as well as by aluminum and incoloy wing bands. Our study also presents a new method of restraint especially suited for small mammals and birds that increases precision of TOBEC measurements. This study shows that TOBEC is a potentially valuable tool for studying changes in body composition of small mammals and may provide insight into the physiological impacts of various life history stages such as postnatal growth, reproduction, and hibernation.",

            "abstractNote": "The long-term study of bat communities often depends on a diverse set of sampling methodologies that are chosen based on the species or habitat management priorities of the research project. Integrating the data from a diverse set of methodologies (such as acoustic monitoring and mist net sampling) would improve our ability to characterize changes in community structure or composition over time, such as one would expect following an emergent infectious disease such as white-nose syndrome. We developed a Bayesian state-space model to integrate these disparate data into a common currency (relative abundance). We collected both acoustic monitoring and mist net capture data over an 8-y period (2006–2014) to document shifts in the bat community in central New England, USA, in response to the onset of white-nose syndrome in 2009. The integrated data model shows a significant decline in the abundance of little brown bat Myotis lucifugus, northern long-eared bat Myotis septentrionalis, and hoary bat Lasiurus cinereus, and an increase in abundance of the eastern small-footed bat Myotis leibii and the eastern red bat Lasiurus borealis. There was no evidence for a change in abundance in the big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus since the onset of white-nose syndrome. The consistency of this model with regional estimates of decline over the same time period support the validity of our relative abundance estimate. This model provides the opportunity to quantify shifts in other communities where multiple sampling methodologies were employed, and therefore provides natural resource managers with a robust tool to integrate existing sampling data to quantify changes in community composition that can inform conservation and management recommendations.",

Acoustic monitoring at multiple locations over 4 winters (2010–2011 through 2013–2014) documented some level of activity in every species, but Myotis leibii (Eastern Small-footed Myotis) and Eptesicus fuscus (Big Brown Bat) were the only 2 species with consistent activity throughout the hibernation period. We modeled winter activity as a function of meteorological variables and the distance to both a presumed local hibernaculum and an important foraging site that we had previously documented at the New Boston Air Force Station. Based on our Random Forest model, ambient temperature was the strongest predictor of winter activity for both species; the highest rate of activity occurred when temperatures were above 12 °C. Although most of the activity occurred during the evening, we detected diurnal activity by both species throughout the winter. The fact that the 2 most abundant species during this winter study are also the 2 most common species captured during the summer suggest that these species are hibernating in close proximity to their summer range.",

To assess the presence of a hantavirus on the island, between October, 2008, and March, 2010, we sampled 585 rodents belonging to seven species in the Anjozorobe-Angavo forest corridor, 70 km north from the capital city Antananarivo. A hantavirus was detected from organs of the ubiquist roof rat (Rattus rattus) and of the endemic Major’s tufted-tailed rat (Eliurus majori). Amazingly, sequence analysis of the S (small), M (medium), and L (large) coding DNA sequence of this virus showed that the Anjozorobe strain (proposed name) was a new genetic variant of Thailand virus (THAIV) that comprises other variants found in Southeast Asia. Because THAIV is suspected of causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans, ongoing studies are addressing the risk of infection by this new variant in the Malagasy population.",

Chiroptera and Rodentia were the most representative orders in the area. Most of the species have Neotropical affinities, and five are considered endemic to the Mexico. Twelve species have legal protection according with three organizations. Equivalence indexes showed a similarity among the different sampled areas, in overall the fauna of Cajón de Peña presented a mammalian resemblance with the Biological Station of Chamela.",

In this species most social interactions between conspecifics are thought to involve mating behavior or territorial disputes. Developing a more complete understanding of the social behavior of this species would provide critical insight to address conservation challenges including high fatality rates from wind turbines during the period of fall migration. We tested the response of hoary bats to conspecific social call playback during the spring and fall migration to: (1) test whether conspecific social call broadcasting attracts or repels individual bats; (2) examine whether there are seasonal differences in these responses; (3) describe the structure and variation of recorded social calls; and (4) test whether conspecific social call playback can increase capture success. Hoary bats were attracted to social call broadcasting during both the spring and fall migration. Hoary bats produced social calls during the spring and fall migration, and when only males were present, suggesting a social function not associated with mating. While calls were variable in frequency and length, social calls tended to be a consistent upsloping shape. Attraction to social calls suggests social interactions not associated with mating behavior in hoary bats, and this technique proved successful as an acoustic lure to aid in capture and study of this elusive species.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Salmonellae are important food and waterborne pathogens and the leading causes of the most widespread acute gastrointestinal illnesses around the globe. The organism has been detected in a wide range of host species such as mites, insects, crustaceans, mussels, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals including wildlife animals. Salmonellae have been isolated in many species of bats in other countries. In the Philippines, there are 70 species of Philippine bats reported of which nine are considered as endemic. Although human salmonellosis (typhoid, paratyphoid and other Salmonella-associated infections) was the primary cause of illnesses and death from the 60 reported foodborne outbreaks (1995 to 2004), no case was ever reported involving Philippine bats. Since transmission of Salmonella from wildlife to humans is possible, as advocated by previous reports, the present study endeavored to isolate and molecularly detect Salmonella spp. from Philippine bats captured from Aklan, Laguna and Quezon City using conventional isolation method and polymerase chain reaction assay respectively. Materials, Methods & Results: A total of 96 apparently healthy bats were used in the study. Bats were captured using nylon mobile mist nets of 3 m long and 1.5 m high with 35 mm mesh size. Eleven species of bats were collected and identified following the reported key to the identification of Philippine bats. Majority of the collected species were insectivores under family Vespertilionidae while the largest population of the Philippine bats were frugivores belonging to family Pteropodidae. Necropsy was performed and intestines were collected and subjected to conventional culture method and PCR detection for Salmonella spp. Two samples (2.08%) were molecularly detected as positive for Salmonella spp. bacterial pathogen. The positive samples were obtained from the intestines of the adult female insectivorous bat species, Miniopterus australis and M. schreibersi, originating from Pangihan cave of Barangay Pablacion, Malay in Aklan. No Salmonella spp. was isolated using the conventional method.",

            "abstractNote": "Underground roosts play a key role in the conservation of cave-dwelling bats. In regions where natural roosts are scarce, human-made artificial roosts can host important populations of these species. The roosts studied in the present work are two railway tunnels abandoned in 1984 that have become one of the biggest cavedwelling bats roosts in the region. Several thousands of roosting bats were reported during summer in the 1990s, and more recently, in the mid-2010s, large groups of hibernating bats and maternity colonies were found in them (Lizana-Ciudad 2015, Hernández-Tabernero et al. 2016). Now, as a measure for local economic development, a hiking route following the railroad has been habilitated and it could threaten bat colonies if many visitors enter into the tunnels. In this work, we present the data of monthly monitoring carried out during 2018 and we propose conservation measures that would allow the coexistence of the touristic hiking route and the remarkable colonies of cave-dwelling bats that the tunnels host. This monitoring shows that the occupation of the roosts is very dynamic, with different species occupying each of them in different seasons. Overall, the longest tunnel is mainly a winter hibernaculum, while the shorter one is used as a breeding roost which hosts large colonies of bats. The most abundant species in the studied roosts were Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis myotis, and Myotis blythii. These roosts seem to be part of a large transnational network of underground roosts that are well known on the Portuguese side with very limited knowledge on the Spanish side. We hope by implementing simple measures, these roosts can be preserved whilst still maintaining the hiking route for visitor enjoyment and promoting the economic development of the area.",

NB-1 has a genome organization typical of a dicistrovirus with multiple 3BVPg and a cripavirus-like intergenic region (IGR)-IRES. NB-1 shares only 41 % average amino acid sequence identity with capsid proteins of Himetobi P virus, indicating a potential novel species in the genus Cripavirus, family Dicistroviridae.",

            "abstractNote": "S Wind energy production is particularly rewarding along coastlines, yet coastlines are often important as migratory corridors for wildlife. This creates a conflict between energy production from renewable sources and conservation goals, which needs to be considered during environmental planning. To shed light on the spatial interactions of a high collision risk bat species with coastal wind turbines (WT), we analysed 32 tracks of 11 common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) in Northern Germany with miniaturized global positioning system units yielding 6266 locations. We used three spatial models to infer on the preferred and avoided landscape features in interaction with WT. We found 3.4% of all locations close to WT, with bats preferring areas with high levels of impervious surface, identified as farmhouses. Common noctule bats were also more present close to WT adjacent to paths and waterbodies. At the local scale, >70% of common noctule bats avoided WT, yet if bats approached WT we counted more positions at large WT, specifically close to known roosts. Our study highlights that coastal WT should not be placed next to feeding grounds and bat roosts. Additionally, avoidance of WT by bats indicates that foraging bats may suffer from habitat loss in coastal landscapes with high turbine densities. To mitigate the conflict between wind energy power production and conservation goals at coastal sites, wind turbines should be placed at distance to habitat features preferred by bats and turbine densities should be limited.",

In the prehispanic México accession of these links and its transmission from generation to generation forged in the community a series of cultural values, which, in addition to cohesion and communal identity, have functioned as elements of order and social control, thus directly or indirectly involved in the process of knowledge and use of wildlife. Based on these aspects, the objective of the present work was to establish the types of cultural values attributed to bats in the prehispanic México. Through a documentary research applying the techniques of secondary and tertiary sources, establishes four types of cultural values for bats: iconographic, religious; symbolic and mythical, which concentrated 15 subtypes of values, among them the link of bat as glyph emblem of authorities, printed, deity and totemic element sign. The importance of this type of study is primarily evidenced cultural values linked to the bats and locates your current utility on the local and/or regional strategies concerning their knowledge and conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Hibernation is a widespread adaptation in animals to seasonally changing environmental conditions. In the face of global anthropogenic change, information about plastic adjustments to environmental conditions and associated mortality costs are urgently needed to assess population persistence of hibernating species. Here, we used a five‐year data set of 1047 RFID‐tagged individuals from two bat species,\n              Myotis nattereri\n              and\n              Myotis daubentonii\n              that were automatically recorded each time they entered or left a hibernaculum. Because the two species differ in foraging strategy and activity pattern during winter, we expected species–specific responses in the timing of hibernation relative to environmental conditions, as well as different mortality costs of early departure from the hibernaculum in spring. Applying mixed‐effects modelling, we disentangled population‐level and individual‐level plasticity in the timing of departure. To estimate mortality costs of early departure, we used both a capture mark recapture analysis and a novel approach that takes into account individual exposure times to mortality outside the hibernaculum. We found that the timing of departure varied between species as well as among and within individuals, and was plastically adjusted to large‐scale weather conditions as measured by the NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) index. Individuals of\n              M. nattereri\n              , which can exploit milder temperatures for foraging during winter, tuned departure more closely to the NAO index than individuals of\n              M. daubentonii,\n              which do not hunt during winter. Both analytical approaches used to estimate mortality costs showed that early departing individuals were less likely to survive until the subsequent hibernation period than individuals that departed later. Overall, our study demonstrates that individuals of long‐lived hibernating bat species have the potential to plastically adjust to changing climatic conditions, although the potential for adjustment differs between species.",

            "abstractNote": "Long‐lived animals with a low annual reproductive output need a long time to recover from population crashes and are, thus, likely to face high extinction risk, if the current global environmental change will increase mortality rates. To aid conservation of those species, knowledge on the variability of mortality rates is essential. Unfortunately, however, individual‐based multiyear data sets that are required for that have only rarely been collected for free‐ranging long‐lived mammals. Here, we used a five‐year data set comprising activity data of 1,445 RFID‐tagged individuals of two long‐lived temperate zone bat species, Natterer's bats (Myotis nattereri) and Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii), at their joint hibernaculum. Both species are listed as being of high conservation interest by the European Habitats Directive. Applying mixed‐effects logistic regression, we explored seasonal survival differences in these two species which differ in foraging strategy and phenology. In both species, survival over the first winter of an individual's life was much lower than survival over subsequent winters. Focussing on adults only, seasonal survival patterns were largely consistent with higher winter and lower summer survival but varied in its level across years in both species. Our analyses, furthermore, highlight the importance of species‐specific time periods for survival. Daubenton's bats showed a much stronger difference in survival between the two seasons than Natterer's bats. In one exceptional winter, the population of Natterer's bats crashed, while the survival of Daubenton's bats declined only moderately. While our results confirm the general seasonal survival pattern typical for hibernating mammals with higher winter than summer survival, they also show that this pattern can be reversed under particular conditions. Overall, our study points toward a high importance of specific time periods for population dynamics and suggests species‐, population‐, and age class‐specific responses to global climate change.",

Many bats use human-made structures, such as bat boxes and buildings, in areas where natural structures are less abundant. Artificial structures, which may be warmer and larger than natural structures, may affect bat behavior and roost use. We studied Yuma Myotis (Myotis yumanensis) and Little Brown Myotis (M. lucifugus) in artificial structures at two sites to understand how roost conditions and reproductive pressures influenced roost switching in maternity colonies in the lower mainland of British Columbia, Canada. During summer 2019, we used Passive Integrated Technology (PIT tags and scanners) to track daily roosting locations of individuals. Yuma myotis and little brown myotis used at least five roosts at each site and switched almost daily among roosts. Bats were less likely to switch from roosts that were 25–42°C and switch roosts during lactation, particularly when the young were nonvolant. Our findings suggest that reproductive female myotis that use artificial roosts seek out warm roosts to limit energy expenditure and speed up offspring development. We also found that bats boxes were not thermally stable environments and the behavior of bats reflected temperature variability. Land managers should ensure that multiple nearby roosts are available to maternity colonies, as reproductive bats require a range of temperatures and roost types during summer.",

However, how structural heterogeneity at the stand level of diﬀerently managed forests drives species richness across taxa is not clear. Here we analyze how birds and bats, sharing the ability to ﬂy, respond to the structural composition of the vegetation layers in diﬀerently managed forests. We combined datasets of birds and bats and compared their response as taxonomic vs. functional richness towards forest structure. Overall our results revealed that bird and bat species richness were positively correlated and species richness of both taxa peaked within the same forest stands. In contrast to our prediction that richness of mobile vertebrates with similar ecological traits (the ability to ﬂy) should respond alike to forest stand characteristics, our results showed almost no congruence. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Eﬀects Modeling (GLMM) with model selection based on AICc and model averaging, we found that taxonomic richness of birds and bats as well as functional richness (based on main diet and foraging mode) responded to forest structure in very diﬀerent ways. While the taxonomic richness of birds was mainly associated with the structural parameters contrast and forest height, representing tall trees and a relatively closed canopy, richness of bat species increased with vertical and horizontal heterogeneity within forest stands. Our ﬁndings indicate that functional richness is more useful to understand responses of bird and bats species richness to land use, forest structure and forest management, rather than focusing solely on taxonomic groups.",

This study presents information about bat roosts and their users in the Itaya River headwater, approximately 80km Southwest of Iquitos City (Northeastern Peru). This study was made from May to October of 2008. We established four sampling localities which were evaluated through intensive searches of potential roosts in line transects. The sampling efort covered 98km and we recorded 21 roosts corresponding to six types. The most common roost type was the tree cavity (n=12), followed by bark (n=5), furled leaf (n=1), termite nest (n=1), tent (n=1) and eroded dirt (n=1): this last type is described here for the irst time. We identiied 14 species representing 12 genera and 4 families (Phyllostomidae, Thyropteridae, Furipteridae and Emballonuridae). Roosts had 1-3 species, but most harbored only one. Phyllostomidae (except Choeroniscus minor), Thyropteridae and Furipteridae used protected sites such as tree cavities, termite nests, furled leaves and tents, while Emballonuridae were often found in exposed sites.",

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT\n            Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor for cell entry. A group of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) has been identified in horseshoe bats. SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities, with the main exception of the N terminus of the spike protein (S), known to be responsible for receptor binding in CoVs. In this study, we investigated the receptor usage of the SL-CoV S by combining a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudovirus system with cell lines expressing the ACE2 molecules of human, civet, or horseshoe bat. In addition to full-length S of SL-CoV and SARS-CoV, a series of S chimeras was constructed by inserting different sequences of the SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S backbone. Several important observations were made from this study. First, the SL-CoV S was unable to use any of the three ACE2 molecules as its receptor. Second, the SARS-CoV S failed to enter cells expressing the bat ACE2. Third, the chimeric S covering the previously defined receptor-binding domain gained its ability to enter cells via human ACE2, albeit with different efficiencies for different constructs. Fourth, a minimal insert region (amino acids 310 to 518) was found to be sufficient to convert the SL-CoV S from non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function. The significance of these findings in relation to virus origin, virus recombination, and host switching is discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The membrane motor protein, prestin, encoded by gene Prestin, provides the electromotility to cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) and is therefore considered responsible for cochlea’s high sensitivity to sound waves. Echolocating bats use ultrasound for orientation and hunting. In this study, we obtained the complete Prestin coding sequences of 60 mammal taxa. Alignment results detected the same 3-bp deletion mutation (c.1833_1835del in exon 18) in two bat lineages, Pteropodidae and Emballonuroidea, and caused an amino acid deletion (p.Asp611del). These two bat lineages orient with vision and echolocation, separately, suggesting that the parallel deletion occurred independently after their split. Homology modeling of the protein structures indicated contrasting structural variations after the deletion of this amino acid. Estimation of the distributions of the surface electrostatic potential coincided with the structural variation. Our findings suggest the complexity of the echolocation in bats but functionality analyses are needed to illuminate it.",

            "abstractNote": "The purpose was to show that displacements, promoters of genetic diversity in metapopulations, increase the probability of survival of bat species adapted to medium and long-distance flights. Samples were taken in four forest fragments, distributed in three municipalities in northern Paraná, and the maximum distance between the studied areas is 20 km. A monthly sampling was performed for each fragment, for the period of July 2008 to June 2009. We used eight nets for collection which remained open during the first four hours of the night, totalling 192 hours during a year of study. The marking occurred from October 2008 to March 2009 and was accomplished through the use of anodised metal rings of four different colours. One hundred and fifty individuals were banded and since the first capture, four displacements were recorded. After five months of collecting and marking, one Carollia perspicillata was found three km away. Two Artibeus lituratus were recorded about 20 km from the marking place: the first one after 22 months and the second one after 24 months. Additionally, one Platyrrhinus lineatus was captured at about 20 km, after 26 months. As they moved around over considerable distances and are not monogamous, they mate with females of other fragments, exchanging genes and reducing or even avoiding inbreeding. Thus, populations of bats have the ability to increase genetic diversity in metapopulations, provided by displacements between the forest fragments. Species that behave like this are not vulnerable to isolation.",

Preliminary study about the richness of species and the capture frequency of bats from two habitats: native forest and Araucária reforestation area, in the center east region of Paraná. The same capture effort for the two areas resulted in 11 species of bats captured in the native forest and eight in the Araucária reforestation area. The uniformity in species abundance – evenness – was higher in the native forest. In the Araucária reforestation area, ninety per cent of the collected individuals belonged only to two species. Results show that the primary forest with numerous niches presents high richness of species, but human action reduces the general richness, which reflects mainly in the small number of species. Myotis ruber is registered in both environments and related in the Brazilian list of threatened species of extinction.",

Leucism is an anomaly of the skin pigmentation of an animal that manifests itself as the total or partial loss of the natural color of the species, and can affect part of or the entire body. During a study involving capture and marking individuals of a population of A. geoffroyi residing in a cave in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, seven individuals with some degree of depigmentation were recorded out of 616 individuals marked, for a frequency of 1.1%. Since leucism is due to recessive gene expression, these findings may indicate that the population is isolated and possesses a high level of endogamy. Factors that may be responsible for this condition in the studied population remain unknown.",

All members of the family Cimicidae show traumatic insemination and a suite of female adaptations to this male trait. Cimicids therefore constitute an ideal model system for examining the extreme causes and consequences of sexual selection. Our dual goal in re-examining the extensive literature on this group is to identify issues relevant to pest control, such as dispersal ecology and the recent global spread, and to understand the selective forces that have shaped the unique aspects of this insect’s biology.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Bats provide important pollination and seed-dispersal services to native angiosperms. However, many bat species are increasingly threatened by human disturbance, including the Mauritian flying fox (Pteropus niger), an endemic, keystone seed disperser. Native forests are scarce and P. niger frequently feeds in commercial plantations, where it now is considered a pest and subjected to frequent culling, thereby hindering conservation efforts. The invasive long-tailed macaque (Primates: Cercopithecidae, Macaca fascicularis) potentially competes with P. niger for scarce native fruits. We investigated the extent of dietary overlap between M. fascicularis and P. niger on Mauritius by sampling fruit drop for 17 tree species and identifying additional food species along line transects. Fruits of 13 of 17 species were eaten by animals and fruit production across tree replicates generally was low but highly variable. Although M. fascicularis ate only 4% of fruit overall, they consumed 20–100% of the fruits of seven species. Approximately 39% of dropped fruits were intact; based on field observations, most probably were dropped by M. fascicularis. Unlike P. niger, M. fascicularis ate mostly unripe fruit and depleted all fruit of certain species at an unripe stage. Hence, M. fascicularis may restrict P. niger’s diet and potentially disrupt seed dispersal of some tree species. Furthermore, small trees are more prone to fruit depletion at an unripe stage by macaques. In addition, asynchronous fruiting phenology across forest fragments may modulate the provision of native fruits to P. niger throughout the year. Although competition can be demonstrated only by controlled experimental studies that are logistically impossible in our scenario, our results highlight potential detrimental consequences that introduced frugivores may have on keystone seed dispersers. Finally, our results suggest that a more integrative and island-wide approach to forest restoration may be valuable for the conservation of P. niger.",

All of species have karyotypes essentially identical to ones previously reported from other regions. Only the banding pattern ofM. blythii, M. nattereri and M. capaccinii showed a slight difference on the chromosomes 9, 13, 14 and 15. In these autosomes could be observed another dark band. T hese differences can be produced due to several methodological modifications, to the extension grade of the chromosomes or to geographic variation. The G-band of M. bechsteinii and M. capaccinii is reported for the first time and shows the absence of any identifiable chromosomal differences between these species and M. nigricans from Nor th America.",

We analyzed stomach contents of L. cinereus and L. noctivagans collected at a wind-turbine facility in southwestern Alberta to gain insight into the feeding behavior of migrating bats. We addressed four questions: (1) Do L. cinereus and L. noctivagans feed while en route? (2) On what prey types do each species feed? (3) Do diets differ between species? (4) Do diets differ between age classes within each species? We found that both species fed while migrating and that their diets were similar to those found in their summer grounds, with the exception that L. cinereus consumed a considerable number of water boatmen (Hemiptera; Corixidae). Diets differed between species and age groups within species.",

We used acoustic monitoring and mist netting over 3 y to assess species diversity and seasonal activity. We also recorded cave temperature during hibernation. During the summers of 2010 to 2012, we captured 470 bats including M. lucifugus, M. septentrionalis, and E. fuscus. We identified 2 migratory species via echolocation recordings in 2011: Lasiurus cinereus (Hoary Bat) was recorded in the area from mid-May to early October, and Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red Bat) from mid-June to early August. Resident bat activity at the hibernaculum was greatest from mid-June to early September. Our findings provide a first approximation of species diversity and describe seasonal activity patterns of bats in Wood Buffalo National Park.",

Accordingly, if fruit bats can be attracted to restoration sites, seed dispersal could be enhanced. We surveyed bat communities at 10 sites in southern Costa Rica to evaluate whether restoration treatments attracted more fruit bats if trees were planted on degraded farmlands in plantations or island configurations versus natural regeneration. We also compared the relative influence of tree cover at local and landscape spatial scales on bat abundances. We captured 68% more fruit bat individuals in tree plantations as in controls, whereas tree island plots were intermediate. Bat activity also responded to landscape tree cover within a 200-m radius of restoration plots, with greater abundance but lower species richness in deforested landscapes. Fruit bat captures in controls and tree island plots declined with increasing landscape tree cover, but captures in plantations were relatively constant. Individual species responded differentially to tree cover measured at different spatial scales. We attribute restoration effects primarily to habitat structure rather than food resources because no planted trees produced fruits regularly eaten by bats. The magnitude of tree planting effects on fruit bats was less than previous studies have found for frugivorous birds, suggesting that bats may play a particularly important role in dispersing seeds in heavily deforested and naturally regenerating areas. Nonetheless, our results show that larger tree plantations in more intact landscapes are more likely to attract diverse fruit bats, potentially enhancing seed dispersal.",

In the best case scenario, roosts would attract seed-carrying bats (Family Phyllostomidae) into degraded pastures and form nucleating patches of native vegetation. We tested this scenario by monitoring 48 artiﬁcial roosts in pastures and adjacent forest fragments in southern Costa Rica over 2 years. Half of the pasture roosts were exposed to direct sunlight and half were afﬁxed to 4-m living stakes of Erythrina poeppigiana (Walp.) O.F. Cook that provided shade. After 2 years, 94% of roosts in forest and 40% of roosts in pasture had been used by bats at least once – primarily for nocturnal feeding. Maximum daily temperature inside of roosts was the best microclimatic predictor of bat visitation. We identiﬁed at least ﬁve species of bats that visited roosts, including two frugivores (Carollia and Glossophaga spp.). Bat-mediated seed dispersal increased with the number of frugivorous bat detections at roosts, but seedling recruitment did not increase with either bat detections or seed abundance over a 2-year period. Given that bats rarely used roosts in pastures, and bat visitation did not increase seedling recruitment, our data suggest that artiﬁcial bat roosts did not accelerate forest regeneration in abandoned, premontane pastures in southern Costa Rica. This method could be reﬁned by investigating alternative roost designs, barriers to seedling recruitment below roosts, improvement of roost microclimatic conditions in pastures, and ability of bats to detect roosts in different habitats.",

            "abstractNote": "Seed dispersal is commonly a limiting process in ecosystem recovery, and several recent studies have proposed novel methods for overcoming this important biological barrier, particularly in tropical pastures. Multiple experiments in various regions have shown that bird perches attract birds and increase seed dispersal but not seedling recruitment in degraded habitats. New bat-focused restoration applications, such as roost boxes and fruit oils, have proven capable of attracting animals and augmenting seed dispersal, but these applications have yet to be vetted by seedling establishment data. Seeds and seedlings in pastures have low probability of survival, attributable to predation, dessication, rot, and competition with ruderal vegetation. As such, these novel applications are unlikely to have the desired effect of accelerating tropical forest succession. Given that seed dispersal is meaningless if arriving seeds cannot survive, and that seedling recruitment measurements are not prohibitively difﬁcult to take, we suggest that studies of novel seed dispersal techniques should include a measure of seedling recruitment. Without this information, it cannot be assumed that such applications accelerate forest recovery.",

I observed a collateral damage problem in southern Costa where people seeking to control common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) indiscriminately killed sympatric, non-target bat species (e.g., by baiting bats with poisoned bananas). To learn about this phenomenon and its causes, I developed and implemented a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior. In a sample of 504 men, 14 percent had individually killed 1–115 bats within the past 5 yr, 68 percent had killed bats as children, and 27 percent said that they would kill bats that they found roosting on their farms, even if they could not identify the species. Men who intended to indiscriminately kill bats thought that it would reduce disease transmission to livestock, whereas men who did not intend to kill bats thought that killing bats would reduce ecosystem functioning and/or damage nature. Ultimately, men were more likely to intend to indiscriminately kill bats if they knew less about bat natural history and/or had previously suffered vampire bats attacking their livestock. Men knew more about bat natural history and were less likely to harbor indiscriminate bat-killing intentions if they had experienced some form of environmental education. My results suggest that environmental education will be most effective for bat conservation when combined with farmer support to ameliorate perceived livelihood risks associated with vampire bats.",

Evening emergences of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in south-central Texas were recorded to determine changes in colony dynamics and to evaluate hypotheses associated with predator avoidance and seasonal energy demands. In 2007, median parturition date was 18 June and lactation lasted about 54 days. Juveniles commenced flight after 41 days, then continued to suckle for 2 weeks before being weaned. Onset of evening emergence was correlated with sunset, beginning, on average, 11.8 min after sunset (95% confidence interval 5 7.1, 16.6), which is later than reported in previous studies. Pregnant females emerged later than their roost mates, consistent with a predator avoidance hypothesis. Lactating females emerged after sunset, but earlier than other bats, consistent with the hypothesis that this is a period of high energy demand. Juveniles emerged later than adult females while they continued to be suckled, but emerged earlier as they matured and were weaned, suggesting a trade-off between predator avoidance and energy demands. Our observations indicate that evening emergence behavior of T. brasiliensis varies with environmental cues but is mediated by the energetic demands of reproduction.",

            "abstractNote": "Many species are widely distributed and individual populations can experience vastly different environmental conditions over seasonal and geographic scales. With such a broad ecological reality, datasets with limited spatial and temporal resolution may not accurately represent a species and could lead to poorly informed management decisions. Because physiological flexibility can help species tolerate environmental variation, we studied the physiological responses of two separate populations of Macronycteris commersoni, a bat widespread across Madagascar, in contrasting seasons. The populations roost under the following dissimilar conditions: either a hot, well-buffered cave or within open foliage, unprotected from the local weather. We found that flexible torpor patterns, used in response to prevailing ambient temperature and relative humidity, were central to keeping energy budgets balanced in both populations. While bats’ metabolic rate during torpor and rest did not differ between roosts, adjusting torpor frequency, duration and timing helped bats maintain body condition. Interestingly, the exposed forest roost induced extensive use of torpor, which exceeded the torpor frequency of overwintering bats that stayed in the cave for months and consequently minimised daytime resting energy expenditure in the forest. Our current understanding of intraspecific physiological variation is limited and physiological traits are often considered to be fixed. The results of our study therefore highlight the need for examining species at broad environmental scales to avoid underestimating a species’ full capacity for withstanding environmental variation, especially in the face of ongoing, disruptive human interference in natural habitats.",

            "abstractNote": "The energy budgets of animal species are closely linked to their ecology, and balancing energy expenditure with energy acquisition is key for survival. Changes in animals’ environments can be challenging, particularly for bats, which are small endotherms with large uninsulated flight membranes. Heterothermy is a powerful response used to cope with changing environmental conditions. Recent research has revealed that many tropical and subtropical species are heterothermic and display torpor with patterns unlike those of “classical” heterotherms from temperate and arctic regions. However, only a handful of studies investigating torpor in bats in their natural environment exist. Therefore, we investigated whether the Malagasy bat Macronycteris commersoni enters torpor in the driest and least predictable region in Madagascar. We examined the energy balance and thermal biology of M. commersoni in the field by relating metabolic rate (MR) and skin temperature (Tskin) measurements to local environmental characteristics in the dry and rainy seasons. Macronycteris commersoni entered torpor and showed extreme variability in torpor patterns, including surprisingly short torpor bouts, lasting on average 20 min, interrupted by MR peaks. Torpid MR was remarkably low (0.13 ml ­O2 ­h−1 ­g−1), even when Tskin exceeded that of normothermia (41 °C). Macronycteris commersoni is thus physiologically capable of (1) entering torpor at high ambient temperature and Tskin and (2) rapidly alternating between torpid and normothermic MR resulting in very short bouts. This suggests that the scope of hypometabolism amongst heterothermic animals is broader than previously assumed and underlines the importance of further investigation into the torpor continuum.",

However, the role of seed dispersal by bats for the maintenance of habitat dynamics in fragmented landscapes is still not understood, with information lacking on landscape-level effects of plant–bat interactions. We present some key topics related to spatial ecology of bats and discuss the potential influence of habitat fragmentation on several aspects of seed dispersal by Neotropical bats. We suggest that future studies need to evaluate bat–plant networks along habitat-loss and fragmentation gradients at the landscape level, including changes in land-cover types and habitat structural complexity, going beyond patch-based analysis. By advancing on the comprehension of ecosystem functioning in fragmented landscapes, we will better understand the bat-modulated seed-dispersal process, supporting regeneration and restoration programs that benefit from bat-based functions.",

Unfortunately, their bad reputation is a major obstacle in their conservation as it creates fear and hostility towards them. Understanding this reputation acquired by bats and studying interactions between bats and humans has shown fundamental promise when creating strategies to forge a non-antagonistic coexistence between both parts and in the promotion of bat conservation in areas with ever-rising human occupation.\nMethods: Ninety people were surveyed from three villages that were situated around a Biological Reserve in the state of Paraiba; located in Northern Brazil. The survey was completed using semi-structured interviews addressing villager’s knowledge of the biology and ecology of bats, their interactions with bats, potential medicinal uses, and their socioeconomic situation. Additionally, we sampled the bats that reside in or visit these villages.\nResults: Bats were often considered harmful, dangerous and carriers of disease. Bats were often connected to hematophagia, as well. The respondents believe that impacts such as the deforestation are forcing bats into urban environments. With this research, we were able to register one of the few records of bats in popular medicine in Brazil.\nConclusion: The folklore and superstition surrounding bats can form an obstacle that affects their conservation. Environmental education is an important step in order to create a harmonious coexistence between humans and bats and to mitigate the impending conflicts between humanity and nature.",

            "abstractNote": "Managed forests have the potential to promote tree microhabitats and hence to conserve the biodiversity, especially of birds, bats, and saproxylic insects, associated with such features. Although the value of tree microhabitats for biodiversity has been described, surprisingly, the factors that explain the occurrence and density of tree microhabitats in managed forests remain poorly known, especially in Mediterranean forests. To address this gap, we studied the occurrence and density of nine types of tree microhabitats inventoried in 1630 trees and 59 forest stands: canopy dead wood; woodpecker cavities; non-woodpecker cavities (with a distinction between lower, medium, and upper cavities); Cerambyx cavities; loose barks or cracks; conks of fungi; and ivy. Each tree was described according to the presence/absence of microhabitats as well as tree diameter, vitality, and species. In each stand, structural variables (basal area, stem density, log volume, stand height, diameter class distribution) and the time since last cutting (i.e., the number of years since the last cutting) were assessed. At the tree level, large-diameter trees, snags, and non-coniferous species supported a higher richness of microhabitats than trees of small diameter, living trees, and conifers. Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), which is a typical species of Mediterranean forests, exhibited a particularly high ability to host microhabitats. Tree diameter was the best predictor of the occurrence of most microhabitats (7 out of 9). We studied co-occurrences among microhabitats, but our results indicated that microhabitat types served poorly as proxies of other microhabitats due to frequent but unspeciﬁc positive relationships. At the stand level, time since last cutting was the best predictor of density of microhabitat-bearing trees and the occurrence of most tree microhabitats. The density of microhabitat-bearing trees was approximately 13 times higher in older stands (>90 years post-cutting) than in recently cut stands (<30 years). To maintain biodiversity in forests, we suggest that managers conserve large trees and snags and preferentially use holm oaks for wood production. Silvicultural practices should include a long rotation period and favor harvesting by group selection to maintain forest stands with a time since last cutting >90 years.",

Here, we develop the ﬁrst global assessment of trends in pollinators, focusing on pollinating birds and mammals. A Red List Index for these species shows that, overall, pollinating bird and mammal species are deteriorating in status, with more species moving toward extinction than away from it. On average, 2.5 species per year have moved one Red List category toward extinction in recent decades, representing a substantial increase in the extinction risk across this set of species. This may be impacting the delivery of beneﬁts that these species provide to people. We recommend that the index be expanded to include taxonomic groups that contribute more signiﬁcantly to pollination, such as bees, wasps, and butterﬂies, thereby giving a more complete picture of the state of pollinating species worldwide.",

We tested sera from 56 Eptesicus fuscus from Georgia against Borrelia hermsii,Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia conorii, and Rickettsia rickettsii. We detected antibodies reactive against a relapsing fever Borrelia and spotted fever group Rickettsia in 3/56 and 1/56 bats, respectively. We attempted to culture Bartonella from the blood of these bats but were unsuccessful. In addition, we fed bat ticks, Carios kelleyi, infected with Rickettsia on a specific pathogen-free guinea pig. The guinea pig had a weak seroconversion to R. rickettsii with a peak titer of 1:32 starting on day 14. Rickettsia was not detected in any of the tissue samples from the guinea pig by molecular means. Our results indicate that E. fuscus is naturally exposed to both a spotted fever group Rickettsia and a relapsing fever group Borrelia. If these agents are transmitted by bat ticks, then people living in close proximity to bat ticks might be exposed. Journal of Vector Ecology 31 (2): 386-389. 2006.",

            "abstractNote": "Little is known about the reproductive habits of the 4 species of bat in the genus Lasiurus that live in Louisiana. We examined reproductive notes from specimen records for the eastern red bat (L. borealis), the Seminole bat (L. seminolus), the northern yellow bat (L. intermedius), and the hoary bat (L. cinereus). We found that gestation and partuition happen between May and June for all species. Lactating and postlactating individuals and juveniles were mostly captured in late June or July. Typically, litter sizes range from 3 to 4 pups for both L. borealis and L. intermedius and from 1 to 3 pups for L. seminolus. Males for all species became scrotal in early fall between August and October, suggesting that fertilization is delayed till the spring. However, we do provide evidence that copulation may also occur in early spring for L. intermedius.",

            "abstractNote": "Contrary to common perception, the number of living mammal species and the relationship of those species with one another are incompletely understood. Taxonomic revisions within mammals are frequent and are often motivated by the discovery of new species. In fact, an analysis of patterns of discovery suggests that complete alpha-taxonomic characterization of living mammals remains a far-off goal. Examination of chronological, geographical, and taxonomic trends in new species discoveries reveals interesting trends, telling biases, and priorities for further study. An average of 223 new valid species have been described per decade since the birth of modern taxonomic nomenclature in 1758, and this rate is increasing. Over 300 new mammal species are expected to be described this decade and some estimates suggest that 7,000+ living species of mammals will eventually be recognized. An analysis of 341 recently described species indicates that the great majority of them are restricted to threatened areas of high endemism—reiterating the biotic richness of these regions, but also indicating that most new species and the regions in which they occur require urgent conservation attention. That the global mammal fauna remains so incompletely characterized reflects the woeful state of knowledge of global biodiversity.",

In this study we have been searching for a likely relationship between diﬀerent feeding habits found in bats and possible adaptive changes in a coding segment of the a-amylase enzyme. We have also tested some hypothesis about the phylogenetic relationship of bats and other mammals. A 663 bp segment of the a-amylase gene, corresponding to the exon 4 and part of the intron c, was sequenced in nine bat species. The exon 4 was also sequenced in further ten mammalian species. The phylogenetic trees generated with diﬀerent methods produced the same results. When the intron c and the exon 4 were independently analyzed, they showed distinct topologies involving the bat species Sturnira lilium, diﬀerent from the traditional bat phylogeny. Phylogenetic analysis of bats, primates and rodents supports the Euarchontoglires-Laurasiatheria hypothesis about the relationship among these groups. Selection tests showed that the a-amylase exon 4 is under strong purifying selection, probably caused by functional constraints. The conﬂicting bat phylogenies could not be explained by evolutionary convergence due to adaptive forces, and the diﬀerent topologies may be likely due to the retention of plesiomorphic characters or the independent acquisition by evolutionary parallelism.",

Correct classification rates produced by the ENNs varied from 91% to 100%; calls from six species were correctly identified with 100% accuracy. Calls from the five species of Myotis, a genus whose species are considered difficult to distinguish acoustically, had correct identification rates that varied from 91 – 100%.

Here, we develop modelling methods that capture elements of each of these factors, to predict the risk of Ebola virus disease (EVD) across time and space. Our modelling results match previously-observed outbreak patterns with high accuracy, and suggest further outbreaks could occur across most of West and Central Africa. Trends in the underlying drivers of EVD risk suggest a 1.75 to 3.2-fold increase in the endemic rate of animal-human viral spill-overs in Africa by 2070, given current modes of healthcare intervention. Future global change scenarios with higher human population growth and lower rates of socio-economic development yield a 1.63-fold higher likelihood of epidemics occurring as a result of spill-over events. Our modelling framework can be used to target interventions designed to reduce epidemic risk for many zoonotic diseases.",

Generalist consumers are often supported by allochthonous resources, which can influence their density, biomass, and distribution. In this study, we investigated the influence of allochthonous aquatic resources on the foraging activity of bats (by ultrasound emissions) and richness of birds (by birdsong records). We also used stable isotope analysis of δ13C and δ15N to determine their diet and trophic space using bayesian Standard Ellipse Area (SEA). We evaluated these responses in near-site (0-1 m from stream margin) and far-site (200 m from stream margin) from six streams in the Atlantic and the Amazon Forest. Foraging activity of bats and richness of Amazonian birds were higher in near-sites compared to far-sites, while Atlantic bird richness was higher in far-sites. We found that emergent aquatic insects and spiders contributed to 46–45% and 49–36% of the diet of insectivorous bats and birds, respectively, regardless of the distance from streams. In Atlantic Forest, SEA of both birds and bats were not compared between plots because of the low sample size. In Amazon Forest, the far-site trophic space of birds showed a higher δ15N position in the bi-plot. These findings suggest that allochthonous resources are important for areas near and far from streams. Our study underscores the impor­ tance of preserving both near and adjacent far habitats in the maintenance of trophic interaction involving flying vertebrates and highlights the interdependence of those areas via allochthonous subsidies.",

However, little is known about how the biogeographic afﬁnities of taxa may affect their responses to these impacts. Our main aim was to study how predicted climate change will affect the distribution of 28 European bat species grouped by their biogeographic patterns as determined by a spatial Principal Component Analysis. Using presence-only modelling techniques and climatic data (minimum temperature, average temperature, precipitation, humidity and daily temperature range) for four different climate change scenarios (IPCC scenarios ranging from the most extreme A1FI, A2, B2 to the least severe, B1), we predict the potential geographic distribution of bat species in Europe grouped according to their biogeographic patterns for the years 2020–2030, 2050–2060 and 2090–2100. Biogeographic patterns exert a great inﬂuence on a species’ response to climate change. Bat species more associated with colder climates, hence northern latitudes, could be more severely affected with some extinctions predicted by the end of the century. The Mediterranean and Temperate groups seem to be more tolerant of temperature increases, however, their projections varied considerably under different climate change scenarios. Scenario A1FI was clearly the most detrimental for European bat diversity, with several extinctions and declines in occupied area predicted for several species. The B scenarios were less damaging and even predicted that some species could increase their geographical ranges. However, all models only took into account climatic envelopes whereas available habitat and species interactions will also probably play an important role in delimiting future distribution patterns. The models may therefore generate ‘best case’ predictions about future changes in the distribution of European bats.",

Here, we combine results from the analysis of two mtDNA fragments with species distribution modelling to determine glacial refugia and postglacial colonization routes. We also investigated whether niche conservatism occurs in this species. Glacial refugia were identified in the three southern European peninsulas: Iberia, Italy and the Balkans. These latter two refugia played a major role in the postglacial colonization process, with their populations expanding to England and central Europe, respectively. Palaeo-distribution models predicted that suitable climatic conditions existed in the inferred refugia during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Nevertheless, the overlap between the current and the LGM distributions was almost inexistent in Italy and in the Balkans, meaning that B. barbastellus populations were forced to shift range between glacial and interglacial periods, a process that probably caused some local extinctions. In contrast, Iberian populations showed a ‘refugia within refugium’ pattern, with two unconnected areas containing stable populations (populations that subsisted during both glacial and interglacial phases). Moreover, the match between LGM models and the refugial areas determined by molecular analysis supported the hypothesis of niche conservatism in B. barbastellus. We argue that geographic patterns of genetic structuring, altogether with the modelling results, indicate the existence of four management units for conservation: Morocco, Iberia, Italy and UK, and Balkans and central Europe. In addition, all countries sampled possessed unique gene pools, thus stressing the need for the conservation of local populations.",

As part of a multipurpose project, the Alqueva dam was constructed during 2001 in Alentejo (Southern Portugal) and has created the largest reservoir in Europe. Its construction caused major changes in the region, mainly due to the deforestation and submersion of an area of 250 km2. A 2-stage survey was implemented in order to evaluate the impact of these landscape changes on bat populations present in the region, as well as to define minimization and compensation measures. Bat activity was surveyed prior to and after the deforestation and flooding of the area, mainly through the use of ultra-sound detectors. The results show a clear decline in bat activity over the area now submerged; islands within the reservoir seem to be the only remaining foraging areas. Furthermore, bat activity increased in the area surrounding the reservoir. In this area, bats used similar foraging habitat types during both stages of the survey, confirming the importance of riparian habitats as foraging areas. Bat populations of this region were thus affected simultaneously by the disappearance of around 200 km of riparian habitat, extensive loss of roosts and the creation of a vast homogeneous habitat that is rarely used for foraging. In projects of this dimension, the future of bat communities is clearly dependent on the preservation of roosts and the most important habitats surrounding the reservoir.",

Therefore, it is integral to understand how species and assemblages will respond to this threat. Elevational gradients present a useful framework to measure potential changes to diversity due to climate change and human land use. Most studies focus on taxonomic diversity, and ignore functional diversity which provides a measure of the ecological roles of species within ecosystems. The aim of this study was to investigate taxonomic and functional diversity of as well as variation in assemblage structure of the insectivorous bat communities along the Mount Nimba elevational gradient. We predicted that both taxonomic and functional diversity would be negatively correlated with elevation, and that bat assemblages would show a nested pattern along the elevational gradient. Taxonomic diversity was calculated using species richness. Functional diversity of univariate and multivariate traits was calculated using two diversity indices: mean pairwise distance and mean nearest taxon distance. As predicted, species richness of bats was significantly negatively correlated with elevation. Functional diversity however, decreased significantly only at the highest elevation (and this may even be a sampling artifact given high human activities there in recent times). Contrary to predictions, metacommunity analyses revealed quasi-Gleasonian structuring of bat assemblages, indicating weak structuring forces along the elevational gradient. These results suggest that bat assemblages shifting in response to climate change along elevational gradients may change taxonomically but stay largely intact functionally.",

Climate change is predicted to force many species to shift their ranges in pursuit of suitable conditions. This study aims to use landscape genetics, the study of the effects of environmental heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of genetic variation, as a predictive tool to assess how species will shift their ranges to track climatic changes and inform conservation measures that will facilitate movement. The approach is based on three steps: 1) using species distribution models (SDMs) to predict suitable ranges under future climate change, 2) using the landscape genetics framework to identify landscape variables that impede or facilitate movement, and 3) extrapolating the effect of landscape connectivity on range shifts in response to future climate change. I show how this approach can be implemented using the publicly available genetic dataset of the grey longeared bat, Plecotus austriacus, in the Iberian Peninsula. Forest cover gradient was the main landscape variable affecting genetic connectivity between colonies. Forest availability is likely to limit future range shifts in response to climate change, primarily over the central plateau, but important range shift pathways have been identiﬁed along the eastern and western coasts. I provide outputs that can be directly used by conservation managers and review the viability of the approach. Using landscape genetics as a predictive tool in combination with SDMs enables the identiﬁcation of potential pathways, whose loss can affect the ability of species to shift their range into future climatically suitable areas, and the appropriate conservation management measures to increase landscape connectivity and facilitate movement.",

            "abstractNote": "The Bat Hawk, Macheiramphus alcinus anderssoni, is a widespread but generally poorly-known crepuscular Old World raptor whose distribution includes Madagascar. Until 2011, when a breeding pair was found in the Mandrozo Protected area in central western Madagascar, little was known about the ecology of the species on this island. The current study concerns its diet, based on regurgitated pellet remains collected on 23 regular occasions between May 2014 and July 2015, at five nesting sites (Andranovaobe, Ampiliravao, Ankirijibe, Ambolamena, and Bokarano) in Mandrozo. The prey species were determined from comparative osteological (birds) and craniodental characters (bats). Using the Jaccard Index, similarity in prey species was calculated for the five nest sites. Diet composition was compared between the dry and rainy seasons, as well as between forested and degraded habitats. The 140 pellets analyzed included numerous bone remains (n = 401), representing 16 forms of bats and 10 species of birds. Prey species were primarily bats (73%), followed by birds (27%). Prey remains identified as Neoromicia/Pipistrellus (MNI = 13.7%) were the most common, followed by Pipistrellus hesperidus, Pipistrellus sp., Hypsugo bemainty and Chaerephon leucogaster, each representing MNI = 6.8%. The bat prey types consumed at Ankirijibe and Ambolamena were the most similar (J = 0.67), while at Ampiliravao and Ankirijibe the bird species eaten showed moderate similarity (J = 0.33). At Andranovaobe, bird prey was the more dominant. There were no significant differences in the prey taken between seasons (p = 0.332) or between habitats (p = 0.113).",

New data are presented herein to ﬁll this void. The diet of this owl consists largely of introduced rodents and there are some marked seasonal differences in the other types of prey taken. Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that this owl has been able to expand its distribution in the wake of human habitat disturbance and the associated trophic proliferation of non-native rodents in disturbed habitats.",
