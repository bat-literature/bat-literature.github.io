            "abstractNote": "Roost selection and diet are fundamentally important to bats and can vary geographically and with habitat. The greater broad-nosed bat (Scoteanax rueppellii) is infrequently captured and poorly known, meaning appropriate conservation actions are difficult to determine. To assess variation across different habitats, we collected faecal samples for dietary analysis and radio-tracked individuals to identify roost trees at four different sites across New South Wales, Australia. Analysis of droppings verified beetles as the main prey in each study area except one dominated by mangroves, and confirmed for the first time carnivory in wild-caught individuals from the presence of hair from other bat species in its droppings. Very large, hollow trees were used as maternity roosts, being typically larger than neighbouring trees. Roosting habitat varied from wet sclerophyll forest in gullies to old-growth mangroves, and tree species used as roosts also varied. Colony size at maternity roosts was often 50–100 bats and fidelity to the maternity roost varied, with some being switched almost daily and others occupied for at least several days. One maternity roost was re-used 2 years later. Both the importance of beetles in the diet and roosts located in more productive landscapes suggest coastal plains and foothills may represent key habitat.",

            "abstractNote": "For many species, estimating density is challenging, but it is important for conservation planning and understanding the functional role of species. Bats play key ecological roles, yet little is known about their free-­ranging density. We used a long-­term banding study of four species caught in an extensively forested climate refuge and spatial capture–­recapture models (SCR) to estimate density and its change over time. Between 1999 and 2020, there were 3671 captures of four bat species, which were all edge-­space foragers. Recaptures represented 16% (n = 587) of all captures, of which 89 were between-­trap-­cluster movements. Closed spatial mark–­recapture models estimated plausible densities that varied with elevation. Preferred elevations differed between species, with density averaging 0.63 ha−1 for Vespadelus darlingtoni (high elevation), 0.43 ha−1 for V. pumilus (low elevation), 0.19 ha−1 for Chalinolobus morio (high elevation), and 0.08 ha−1 for V. regulus (high elevation). Overall, densities were higher than most previous published estimates for bats. Forest disturbance history (past timber harvesting) had no detectable effect on density. Density also varied substantially across years, and although annual maximum temperature and rainfall were not supported in models, some time periods showed an apparent relationship between density and annual rainfall (+ve) and/or annual maximum temperature (−ve). The most notable change was an increase in the density of V. pumilus after 2013, which tracked an increase in annual temperature at the site, reflecting a warming climate. Bat densities in forests outside of climate refugia are likely to be more sensitive to climate change, but more studies are needed in different habitats and continents and outside climate refugia to place the densities we estimated into a broader context.",

            "abstractNote": "Ultrasonic detectors were used to compare bat activity and species richness at replicated continuous and isolated forests, large and small remnants, corridors and open areas on the south-west slopes of New South Wales, Australia. The habitat matrix in this area consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with indigenous forest remnants and pine plantations. Ten taxa of bat were recorded, with the fewest in corridors. A multivariate analysis revealed that a gradient in forest area, habitat diversity and structural complexity was the most consistent predictor of activity for four taxa (C. morio, Nyctophilus spp., V. regulus and F. tasmaniensis), suggesting that these are sensitive to the eects of forest fragmentation. Six species (N. australis, M. planiceps l.p., C. gouldii, M. schreibersii, V. darlingtoni, V. vulturnus) appeared tolerant of fragmentation and were not sensitive to isolation eects. Most tolerant species were active over open areas and probably used resources in the agricultural mosaic. Typically they were fast ¯ying, low manoeuvrability species which are predicted to forage in uncluttered habitats. Although total activity in small remnants and corridors was as great as that in large forests continuous with a 690 000 ha national park, feeding activity was greatest in continuous forests, suggesting that larger forests with high habitat diversity oered more foraging opportunities. Despite providing fewer feeding opportunities, remnants represent an important conservation resource for bats because activity is concentrated here and they provide potential roost sites. Activity of each species in open areas was not signi®cantly lower than that in corridors (nonriparian), suggesting that corridors were not used regularly by bats to move through the landscape. More detailed studies of the movements of species identi®ed as sensitive to fragmentation would help to explain how fragmentation aects these species and thus what measures are required to improve their conservation. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

            "abstractNote": "Mega-ﬁres in the Australian summer of 2019–20 resulted in the largest ever documented forest ﬁre extent. These ﬁres impacted many species, but individual responses remain poorly known, making assessments of their conservation status and ongoing threats uncertain. We assessed the inﬂuence of the 2019–20 mega-ﬁres on habitat occupancy in the golden-tipped bat Phoniscus papuensis, a specialist which roosts in suspended birds’ nests and occurs in relictual Gondwanan rainforest not typically exposed to ﬁre. We used trapping and accounted for nightly detection probability (lower detection with increasing rainfall) to estimate site occupancy. Occupancy increased with the local (1 km buffer surrounding each site) extent of rainforest, gullies and unburnt forest. The model predicted a strong negative effect of ﬁre in the surrounding buffer, with occupancy reduced from >90% at sites with suitable habitat (extensive rainforest and gully systems) surrounded by unburnt forest to 20% when the entire surrounding area was burnt (regardless of severity). Gully rainforest sites surrounded by a mixture of burnt and unburnt forest were modelled to have intermediate occupancy values. On average, ﬁre severity mapping revealed that 22% of rainforest in the 1 km buffer surrounding our burnt sites was unburnt, 61% had a low severity burn, while 17% experienced a high severity burn. The lower occupancy of P. papuensis in burnt rainforest was associated with a reduction in the abundance of suspended bird nests, a critical resource used for day-roosting. Our results quantify the effects of extreme ﬁre events on animal populations in rainforest that is normally unaffected by ﬁre. The large extent of rainforest burnt during the 2019–20 Australian season of ‘mega-ﬁres’ and its strong negative effect on occupancy highlights the vulnerability of animal species reliant on ﬁre-sensitive habitat to a climate-change driven increase in such extreme ﬁre events.",

Four species (Nycteris thebaica, Lavia frons, Mus tenellus, Helogale parvula) were documented for the first time in the Sanctuary, two species (Rhinolophus fumigatus, Mastomys awashensis) were found new for eastern Ethiopia and the presence of another species (Neoromicia zuluensis) was confirmed for the first time within the limits of Ethiopia. Moreover, genetic and chromosomal characteristics of two rodents (Acomys sp. and Gerbilliscus cf. robustus) suggested new undescribed species. In total, according to our current estimate based on original data and previously published literature, the mammal fauna of the Sanctuary includes 59 species belonging to 11 orders, 30 families and 51 genera. The Babille Elephant Sanctuary has significant conservation value due to its high mammal species diversity and complex structure of the fauna including elements with different zoogeographic affinities.",

            "abstractNote": "We compared the microclimate experienced by maternity groups of eastern cave bats (Vespadelus troughtoni) in northern New South Wales between roosts in overhang caves versus a nearby maternity roost beneath the corrugated iron roof of a farm shed. The shed’s microclimate differed dramatically from that of the caves. Caves provided wellbuffered microclimate conditions, which were cooler and more humid than ambient conditions during the day, but were warmer and less humid than ambient at night. Early summer temperatures remained between 20 and 25°C in the maternity caves. In contrast, the microclimate at the shed was not buffered, with conditions varying enormously over a 24-h period, being hotter than ambient during the day (mean = 30°C, maximum = 40°C in the middle of the day), and similar to ambient at night (mean = 18°C at dawn). Rather than selecting thermal stability, lactating females selected warm, but variable, diurnal temperatures in the shed, presumably to sustain lactation. Under this situation, we estimated considerable energetic savings by roosting in the shed (27–35%, assuming normothermia) compared with that for caves, and even higher savings if bats were torpid in the mornings and passively rewarmed later (60–69%). Lactating bats therefore presumably tradedoff the cost of leaving juveniles behind in a cool roost at night with these energetic benefits. In late autumn bats continued to roost in the shed with day temperatures rising above 30°C, compared with unoccupied caves, which were considerably cooler at this time (~20°C). Clarification of the estimated energy savings and the possible costs in terms of milk production requires further research to measure concurrently body temperatures, roost temperature and energy expenditure, together with juvenile growth in different types of roosts.",

It is thought that feeding a diet that is low in iron can prevent the onset of this disease; however, manufacturing a diet with commonly available foodstuffs that contains a sufficiently low iron concentration is difficult. An alternative is to feed captive animals that may be susceptible to this disease potential iron chelators such as tannins that may bind to iron and block its absorption. Using stable isotope methods established in humans, we measured iron bioavailability in straw‐colored fruit bats (\n              Eidolon helvum\n              ) and tested whether tannic acid significantly reduced the extent of iron absorption. Regardless of dose, tannic acid significantly reduced iron absorption (by 40%) and in the absence of tannic acid, iron absorption was extensive in this species (up to 30%), more so than in humans. Species susceptible to iron storage disease may efficiently absorb iron in the gut regardless of iron status, and supplementing these species with tannic acid in captivity may provide an alternative or additional means of preventing the development of this disease.

On continents, the effects of logging are greatest on endemic species, presumably because disturbance is more likely to cover narrower distributions (the “cookie cutter” model). Islands hold disproportionate biodiversity, and are subject to accelerating biotic homogenization, where specialist endemics are lost while generalists persist. We tested responses of tropical island mammals to logging at multiple spatial scales, using a long-term experimental test in a Pacific archipelago. The most widely distributed ecological generalists did not decline after logging, and we detected no overall changes in relative abundance or species diversity. However, endemics with small ranges did decline in response to logging. The least mobile and most range-restricted species declined even at the smallest spatial scale, supporting the cookie cutter model for sedentary species, and suggesting that habitat change due to selective logging is contributing to biotic homogenization on islands.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are essential to the functioning of many island ecosystems. A large proportion of Pacific Island Pteropus are endemics, limited in their distribution to single paleotropical islands or close island groups. This subset is also highly threatened by hunting and habitat disturbance. Further exacerbating these threats is a dearth of scientific knowledge that makes long-term management and conservation planning difficult. We aimed to gather data on seven bat species from Nendo¨, Reef Islands, Tinakula, and Vanikoro (Solomon Islands), and Vanua Lava and Mota (Vanuatu). Between 1990 and 2019 we surveyed bats using walked transects, mist nets and camp counts, and collected data on diets and roosting sites. Data collection targeted four limited range endemics (Nendo¨ tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene sanctacrucis), Banks flying-fox (Pteropus fundatus), Temotu flying-fox (Pteropus nitendiensis) and Vanikoro flying-fox (Pteropus tuberculatus), and three more widespread species (Vanuatu flying-fox (Pteropus anetianus), Pacific flying-fox (Pteropus tonganus) and Fijian blossom bat (Notopteris macdonaldi). Notopteris macdonaldi, P. nitendiensis, P. tonganus and P. tuberculatus were the most common species recorded on transects and mist net surveys. Transect encounter rates were 0.1–4.5 kmÀ1 (P. nitendiensis), 0.2–20.0 kmÀ1 (P. tonganus) and 0–7.2 kmÀ1 (P. tuberculatus). Pteropus fundatus was rarer, we did not detect this species during daytime searches, and it was the least common mist net capture. We documented 65 Pteropus food plants in our study area. Nyctimene sanctacrucis was not detected on Nendo¨, Tinakula and Reef Islands despite considerable effort. We consider this bat is likely extinct, if in fact it is a distinct species.",

In addition to cryptic diversity, the widespread distributions and graded morphologies of some species render the taxonomy of this family poorly resolved. We used sequences of the mitochondrial gene\n              ND\n              2 and the nuclear gene\n              RAG\n              1 to reconstruct molecular phylogenetic relationships for hipposiderid species.

Our results suggest the presence of undescribed diversity in northern\n              A\n              ustralia.

Furthermore, underrepresentation of existing biodiversity in the literature has the potential to detract from conservation planning and action. Between 18 and 29 October 2018, we surveyed the terrestrial vertebrates of East Rennell, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Solomon Islands. We documented 56 species, including 15 squamates, 13 mammals, and 38 birds, and present four new vertebrate records for the island: Stephan’s emerald dove (Chalcophaps stephani), Maluku myotis (Myotis moluccarum), littoral skink (Emoia atrocostata) and brahminy blindsnake (Indotyphlops braminus). East Rennell was designated a World Heritage site for its significant on-going ecological and biological processes, and importance for the study of island biogeography. The new records presented here provide evidence that continued field studies combined with DNA analysis will continue to uncover even greater endemic biodiversity. Rennell is currently experiencing major habitat destruction in parts of the island that are not under World Heritage protection, and we anticipate collateral damage will likely extend into protected areas. Our survey also underscores the incredible vertebrate biodiversity that stands to be lost unless conservation actions and local community needs are intertwined to promote beneficial outcomes on both fronts.",

            "abstractNote": "Basic knowledge of species diversity and distributions underpins the study of island biogeography and is fundamental for conservation planning. In Solomon Islands, new mammals continue to be described and several lineages are yet to be documented from large islands where, presumably, they should occur. On Malaita and Makira, no giant rats (Solomys or Uromys), or monkey-faced bats (Pteralopex) have been documented by scientists, but traditional knowledge suggests they exist. In East Kwaio, Malaita, we combined traditional knowledge and scientific methods to survey mammals and search for these taxa. Camera traps, mist nets, spotlight surveys, echolocation call recorders, rat traps and active searches were used to produce an inventory of the island’s mammals. No Solomys, Uromys or Pteralopex were captured. However, detailed accounts suggest that giant rats and monkey-faced bats were present as recently as 1996 and 2002 respectively. Moreover, we consider the presence of gnawed Canarium nuts an indicator that giant rats still persist. The human population of Malaita is dense, hunting pressure appears high, feral cats are common, and logging is rapidly reducing primary forests. A notable feature of this work has been the commitment towards collaboration and upskilling landowners in mammal survey techniques. This collaboration has helped fuel a growing conservation movement on Malaita and led to the designation of three large conservation areas. Gathering evidence for the existence of undescribed mammals on Malaita is paramount for reducing further extinctions in Melanesia. Continued support for skilled community members in East Kwaio will be key to collecting this evidence.",

            "abstractNote": "While relatively little is known about bats across much of Africa, globally, many bat populations are in decline due to human activities. Successful bat conservation efforts, therefore, depend on both ecological studies and research on human-bat relationships. To address these knowledge gaps about African bats and their interactions with humans, we used semi-structured interviews of pastoralists in northwestern Namibia to assess local experiences with, attitudes toward, and cultural stories about bats. Our research was conducted in conjunction with an ecological study on Namib Desert bat distributions, thus allowing for a broader understanding of the social-ecological dynamics of human-bat interactions in this region. Though only 65% of interviews were able to correctly identify bats from photographs, 100% classified these species as bats when provided with an additional description of “animals that fly at night.” A majority (77%) of interviews expressed positive attitudes toward bats and over a third (38%) provided cultural stories, offering detailed reports of myths and common meanings assigned to bats. Of those stories, 12% indicated that bats brought good luck or good rains, and 84% specified that bats represented bad luck or omens of injuries, death, disease, or lack of rains. While the primary threats of habitat loss and bushmeat hunting were never mentioned in our interviews, the influence of negative cultural stories on individual behavior could pose challenges for future bat conservation initiatives. This qualitative approach combined with ecological research may be valuable for assessing cross-cultural relationships between humans and understudied wildlife in other remote areas.",

But body size can evolve in parallel, reaching similar final states despite independent evolutionary and geographic origins, leading to faulty assumptions of evolutionary history. Here, we document parallel evolution in body size in the widely distributed leaf-nosed bat genus Hipposideros, which has misled both taxonomic and evolutionary inference. We sequenced reduced representation genomic loci and measured external morphological characters from three closely related species from the Solomon Islands archipelago, delimited by body size. Species tree reconstruction confirms the paraphyly of two morphologically designated species. The nonsister relationship between large-bodied H. dinops lineages found on different islands indicates that large-bodied ecomorphs have evolved independently at least twice in the history of this radiation. A lack of evidence for gene flow between sympatric, closely related taxa suggests the rapid evolution of strong reproductive isolating barriers between morphologically distinct populations. Our results position Solomon Islands Hipposideros as a novel vertebrate system for studying the repeatability of parallel evolution under natural conditions. We conclude by offering testable hypotheses for how geography and ecology could be mediating the repeated evolution of large-bodied Hipposideros lineages in the Solomon Islands.",

To address this knowledge gap, we examined relationships between bodies of water and bat communities in the northern Namib Desert. We predicted that water quality would be poorer (i.e., higher indices of electrical conductivity and ion concentrations) during the dry season and at artiﬁcial pools, and that bat species richness and activity would consequently be lower at these sites. We conducted extensive ﬁeldwork at the terminus of the hot, dry season from November 2016 to January 2017 and at the conclusion of the following wet season from March to May 2017, collecting water samples and acoustic recordings of bat activity at both natural springs (n = 18) and artiﬁcial pools (n = 5). Overall activity (but not species richness) was greater during the wet season and at artiﬁcial pools, but we did not ﬁnd systematic diﬀerences in water quality driven by seasonality or water body type. Although individual artiﬁcial pools harbored signiﬁcantly greater bat activity, > 35% of the species that we recorded were present only at natural springs. While bat species richness was reduced at saline sites, only the activity of the Zulu serotine also related to water quality. In general, water surface area was more often associated with bat activity in the Namib Desert than was water quality.",

            "abstractNote": "In extreme environments, temperature and precipitation are often the main forces responsible for structuring ecological communities and species distributions. The role of biotic interactions is typically thought to be minimal. By clustering around rare and isolated features, like surface water, however, effects of herbivory by desert-dwelling wildlife can be ampliﬁed. Understanding how species interact in these environments is critical to safeguarding vulnerable or data-deﬁcient species. We examined whether African elephants (Loxodonta africana), black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), and southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa) modulate insectivorous bat communities around permanent waterholes in the Namib Desert. We estimated megaherbivore use of sites based on dung transects, summarized vegetation productivity from satellite measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index, and surveyed local bat communities acoustically. We used structural equation models to identify relationships among megaherbivores and bat species richness and dry- (November 2016–January 2017) and wet- (February–May 2017) season bat activity. Site-level megaherbivore use in the dry season was positively associated with bat activity—particularly that of open-air foragers—and species richness through indirect pathways. When resources were more abundant (wet season), however, these relationships were weakened. Our results indicate that biotic interactions contribute to species distributions in desert areas and suggest the conservation of megaherbivores in this ecosystem may indirectly beneﬁt insectivorous bat abundance and diversity. Given that how misunderstood and understudied most bats are relative to other mammals, such ﬁndings suggest that managers pursue shortterm solutions (e.g., community game guard programs, water-point protection near human settlements, and ecotourism) to indirectly promote bat conservation and that research includes megaherbivores’ effects on biodiversity at other trophic levels.",

The primary study site was an opening in secondary forest adjacent to the Children’s Eternal Rainforest. We passively monitored the echolocation calls of all bats detected by an Anabat II detector all night for 1,147 nights from November 2000 through August 2010, from which we were able to identify the species in more than 250,000 bat passes. Simultaneously, we recorded environmental variables. Five species accounted for most of the activity, but the relative frequency of these species fluctuated widely over the ten-year period. The likelihood of any one of the three most common species being present was significantly influenced by wind, rain, phase of the moon, the time of night, the season of the year, and the presence of the other two species. In general, strong winds are associated with an increase in bat activity, moderate to heavy rain seems to halt bat activity, full moon appears to depress bat activity, and bats seem to be most active early in the evening. The number of bat passes at the study site declined over the ten-year period, possibly at least partially due to bat preference for foraging near bright lights, which increased markedly during the period due to development for tourism.",

Slit-faced bats seem to prefer those insects characterized by large body size, abundance and ease of location and capture. Many of these are captured, while stationary, or at least when at rest rather than it flight.",

            "abstractNote": "Signiﬁcant changes in local climate and correlated changes in non mammalian vertebrate populations have been documented in the Monteverde cloud forest in the Tileran Mountains of northern Costa Rica, leading to the prediction that corroborative changes should occur in bat populations. Habitat changes resulting from development for ecotourism, including a 19% increase in forest, might also be expected to impact bat populations. Analysis of data collected between 1973 and 1999 in Monteverde supports the hypothesis, although changes are less dramatic than those shown for birds, reptiles, and amphibians in earlier studies. Capture rates did not change signiﬁcantly during the 27 year sample period, but relative species abundance increased, and at least 24 new species (of mostly lowland distribution) were recorded in the study area during the 1980s, 1990s, and through early 2002. These changes are likely a consequence of climatic change following global warming, forest clearing, and an increase in amount of secondary forest. This latter factor is a result of changes in land use due to development for tourism.",

Several physical and genetic traits have been used with mixed success to distinguish Myotis keenii (Merriam, 1895) (Keen’s myotis) and Myotis evotis (H. Allen, 1864) (long-eared myotis), but it is unclear whether species distinction is biologically warranted. We generated 12–14 microsatellite locus genotypes for 275 long-eared Myotis representing four species — M. keenii, M. evotis, Myotis septentrionalis (Trouessart, 1897) (northern myotis), and Myotis thysanodes Miller, 1897 (fringed myotis) — from across northwestern North America and 23 Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831) (little brown myotis) as the outgroup. Population genetic analyses revealed four well-deﬁned groups (species): M. septentrionalis, M. thysanodes, M. lucifugus, and a single group comprising M. keenii and M. evotis. We document high rates of gene ﬂow within M. evotis/M. keenii. Cytochrome b gene (mtDNA) sequencing failed to resolve morphologically identiﬁable species. We highlight the importance of geographically thorough investigation of genetic connectivity (nuclear markers) when assessing taxonomic status of closely related groups. We document a morphometric cline within M. evotis/M. keenii that may in part explain earlier analyses that led to the description of the smaller bodied M. keenii (type locality: Haida Gwaii). We conclude that M. keenii does not qualify as a genetic or biological species.",

            "abstractNote": "Trees in cities provide multiple ecosystem services. However, simultaneously ensuring healthy trees with high habitat diversity can be challenging in a harsh urban environment. We compared health, microhabitats, and bat activities between native (Quercus robur L.) and non-native (Quercus rubra L.) oaks growing in different urban habitats (street vs. park) in Karlsruhe, southwestern Germany. We randomly selected 167 oak trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >20 cm across the city from Urban Tree Registrar. We performed tree health assessment, dendrometric, and microhabitat inventory. We recorded the four-day bat activities on 45 native and non-native oaks with acoustic loggers installed on the trees. We found that non-native oaks were healthier than native oaks but provided less abundance and richness of microhabitats. Tree size (positive effect) and pruning (negative effect) strongly inﬂuence microhabitat richness and abundance. In addition, park trees hosted signiﬁcantly more microhabitats than street trees. We recorded the activities of 9 bat species from 4 genera. Pipistrellus bats were more active in park trees than street trees. Long-eared bats (Plecotus) were more active near the native than non-native oaks. Bats are likely favored by microhabitats such as fork split, lightning scar, and woodpecker “ﬂute” that are more common in less healthy trees. We conclude that non-native red oak can be planted alongside streets, where the conditions are harsher than in parks to better adapt to climatic changes and stay healthy with less maintenance. The preservation of native pedunculate oak trees, especially within parks, is paramount for urban biodiversity conservation because of their potential to provide microhabitats and supporting bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Characterizing sounds produced by animals can lead to better understanding of their behavioral ecology and conservation. While considerable focus has been on signals used by bats for echolocation, there has been less emphasis on nonecholocation sounds. We describe songs (i.e., acoustic vocalizations with distinctive syllable types in series or in complex motifs) produced by silver‐haired bat (\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              ). Songs, characterized by a sequence (song phrase) of 3 distinct vocalization types, were confirmed by observing free‐flying, silver‐haired bats at mine hibernacula in British Columbia, Canada. The song patterns were relatively consistent with each song phrase consisting of a lead call, followed by a droplet call, and finishing with a series of multiple chirp calls. The function of the songs is unknown, however, as other bat species produce songs for mating, we propose silver‐haired bat songs may similarly be associated with courtship or mating. Alternative functions cannot be ruled out, particularly because we recorded some songs outside of the accepted mating period. Other research has determined peak mating of silver‐haired bats occurs in fall, and spring mating has been documented. Here we additionally provide evidence of winter mating in British Columbia. The proportion of silver‐haired bat songs recorded relative to echolocation recordings varied across locations and seasons. While we recorded songs in all months of the year, more than half of the songs were produced during winter, and 93.4% (of 1,857) were produced outside of summer months. Song production in summer could be associated with other behaviors such as learning or practice, establishing or maintaining social bonds, or male‐male competition. To provide landscape and temporal context, we summarize acoustic datasets from numerous locations in western North America where recordings were made between 2005 and 2022.",

            "abstractNote": "A free-ranging maternity colony of big brown bats Eptesicus fuscus roosting in rock crevices along the South Saskatchewan River in south-eastern Alberta, Canada, was studied to understand better the discrepancy that exists in the literature regarding torpor use by reproductive female bats. Using radio-telemetry, thermoregulatory patterns and roost microclimate were recorded for pregnant, lactating and post-lactating females. Relative torpor use is described in several ways: the proportion of days on which torpor was used, depth, minimum body temperature, time spent in torpor, and a comprehensive torpor unit (degree-min). Pregnant and lactating female E. fuscus used torpor to the same extent overall (degree-min), but pregnant bats used torpor less frequently and with more time in deep torpor. Torpor was used to the greatest extent after weaning (post-lactation). Evidence is presented that the cost : beneﬁt ratio for deep and prolonged periods of torpor may be highest during lactation. Microclimates of rockcrevice roosts mirrored the use of torpor throughout reproduction by bats. Lactation roosts (deeper, larger opening size) were more thermally stable and remained warmer at night compared to the shallow roosts used by pregnant and post-lactating females. It is shown that conclusions about relative use of torpor can differ depending on the units of comparison, necessitating measurement of all aspects of torpor (depth, duration and frequency). Comprehensive measurements, individual-based normothermic temperatures, and a deﬁnition of torpor that accounts for all energy savings, allow a more accurate depiction of patterns and facilitates inter-study comparisons.",

We compared patterns of thermoregulation in relation to microclimate and compared reproductive timing for maternity colonies of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) roosting in natural and building roosts in the prairies of southeastern Alberta. During pregnancy, bats roosting in buildings used torpor less frequently than did rockroosting bats, but achieved lower body temperatures when torpid. Less-frequent use of torpor leaves more active days for fetal development, and bats in building roosts gave birth earlier than those in rock roosts. We observed predators and predation in rock roosts, but not in building roosts, and suggest that bats roosting in rocks use shallower torpor to remain vigilant. Patterns of torpor use suggest that bats in buildings save more energy than rock-roosting individuals by roosting in the warmer microenvironments of buildings and by achieving lower body temperatures when ambient conditions are cold and foraging is not productive. The warmer building roosts are also conducive to juvenile growth, and young building-roosting bats ﬂedged 1–2 weeks before rock bats. We propose that advantages for bats roosting in buildings (lower predation risk, earlier births, faster juvenile growth rates, and increased energy savings) lead to greater long-term reproductive success for building-roosting bats and make buildings preferred roosts.",

We compiled and examined a data set of Eastern Red Bat capture and acoustic records from northern Alberta to examine their distribution, seasonality, and reproductive status near the edge of their range. Acoustic data suggested widespread but patchy distribution across Alberta. The number of captures of Eastern Red Bats in northern Alberta were similar to those of Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus), suggesting that the species may be more common than previously thought. However, we failed to find evidence of reproduction in female Eastern Red Bats in Alberta. Small sample sizes, timing of surveys or difficulty in recognizing juveniles may explain the apparent lack of reproduction. Similar to Hoary Bats, reproductive adult male Eastern Red Bats have been captured with enlarged testes in northern Alberta in August, suggesting sperm production and possibly the start of breeding is taking place there in late summer. In northern Alberta, acoustic monitoring in early spring provided evidence of migratory bats early in the season. A better understanding of seasonal movement patterns and migration, habitat use, and reproduction of Eastern Red Bats in western Canada will require further study. Regardless, our data provide further evidence that the Eastern Red Bat is a more regular member of the bat fauna of northwestern Canada than previously recognized, which may be a result of an expanding distribution.",

Only 2 species of bats, the Northern Myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) and Little Brown Myotis (M. lucifugus), were previously known from the Nahanni National Park Reserve in the southwestern NWT. We used mistnets (15 nights) and AnaBat ultrasound detectors (23 nights) to survey bats in the South Nahanni River Watershed and surrounding area, to undertake the first formal survey of bats in the Northwest Territories. We confirmed the presence of the 2 species formerly documented from the area, as well as an additional 5 species not previously recorded from the region, including: Longeared Myotis (Myotis evotis), Long-legged Myotis (M. volans), Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus), Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinerus), and Eastern Red Bat (L. borealis). Four species were captured in mistnets (Northern Myotis, Little Brown Myotis, Long-eared Myotis and Long-legged Myotis), 1 species was detected acoustically and observed visually in flight (E. fuscus), and 2 species were only detected acoustically (L. cinereus, L. borealis). We documented both sexes for Long-legged, Northern, and Little Brown Myotis; however, reproduction was confirmed only in the latter 2 species. These observations represent the most northerly record (616N) for Long-eared Myotis and Long-legged Myotis in North America, extending their range approximately 300 km. These 2 species have not been captured elsewhere in NWT, despite recent substantial sampling effort in southcentral NWT. Further sampling effort is needed in southwestern NWT to better understand the distribution of bats in this region.",

We documented roosting behaviour and roost selection. During pregnancy and lactation, individuals aggregated as several small groups or one large group (maternity colony). Postlactating females roosted alone more frequently. During postlactation, individuals periodically returned to roost with a group dominated by pups, between periods of roosting alone. We identified 72 roosts used by members of the colony. Adult females switched roosts frequently and few roosts (24%) were reused. During pregnancy and lactation, the colony roosted in a 1.25-km length of the river valley on the northwest side of the river. With the onset of postlactation, females began roosting on both sides of the river and within a longer section of the river valley, and roosts faced in a more southerly direction. Crevices selected as roosts were more vertical in orientation, were farther from level ground above, and had openings that were smaller than those randomly available. Roosts used during pregnancy, lactation, and postlactation differed in physical attributes; lactation roosts were deeper and had larger openings. Selection of crevices with particular attributes suggested that selection was based on microclimate and avoidance of predation.",

            "abstractNote": "Periodic arousal from hibernation among mammalian hibernators is poorly understood. In bats, arousal is often associated with flight. We acoustically monitored two rocky areas along the Red Deer River in southeastern Alberta for bat activity in autumn, winter, and spring months. We found bats to be active in all months and at unexpectedly cold temperatures (coldest activity –8 8C). Bats were active even when ambient temperatures remained below 0 8C during the day and night. We documented Myotis ciliolabrum (Merriam, 1886), Myotis evotis (H. Allen, 1864), and Eptesicus fuscus (Beauvois, 1796) flying outside hibernacula in winter. Active E. fuscus that we captured in mid-winter of 2004–2005 weighed less than bats captured in the fall, but masses ranged from 14.0 to 21.0 g, indicating that some individuals still had fat reserves. Captured individuals were of various ages, with a male bias. Using radiotelemetry, we located the first natural rock-crevice hibernacula for male and female E. fuscus in the Canadian prairies. Winter roosts were narrow, deep rock crevices or erosion holes located in steep valley walls. We found evidence to suggest that dehydration may be a driving force for winter flights. Re´sume´ : L’e´veil pe´riodique durant l’hibernation chez les mammife`res hibernants reste mal compris. Chez les chauvessouris, l’e´veil est souvent associe´ au vol. Nous avons suivi par des me´thodes acoustiques l’activite´ des chauves-souris dans deux re´gions rocheuses le long de la Red Deer dans le sud-est de l’Alberta durant les mois de l’automne, de l’hiver et du printemps. Nous trouvons des chauves-souris actives a` tous les mois et a` des tempe´ratures e´tonnamment froides (–88C, tempe´rature d’activite´ la plus basse). Les chauves-souris sont actives meˆme lorsque les tempe´ratures ambiantes restent sous 08C durant le jour et la nuit. Nous avons observe´ Myotis ciliolabrum (Merriam, 1886), Myotis evotis (H. Allen, 1864) et Eptesicus fuscus (Beauvois, 1796) en train de voler hors de leur hibernacle en hiver. Les E. fuscus capture´s au milieu de l’hiver 2004–2005 sont moins lourds que ceux capture´s a` l’automne, mais leur masse varie de 14,0 a` 21,0 g, ce qui indique que certains individus ont encore des re´serves lipidiques. Les individus capture´s appartiennent a` diffe´rentes classes d’aˆge et il y a une majorite´ de maˆles. A` l’aide de la radiote´le´me´trie, nous avons trouve´ les premiers hibernacles naturels dans des crevasses rocheuses pour les maˆles et les femelles d’E. fuscus dans les prairies canadiennes. Les perchoirs d’hiver consistent en des crevasses rocheuses e´troites et profondes ou en des trous d’e´rosion situe´s dans des parois escarpe´es des valle´es. Nous avons des indications qui laissent croire que la de´shydratation peut eˆtre le motif qui explique les vols d’hiver.",

We present background information, relevant comparisons, and clariﬁcation of analyses to further strengthen our conclusions. The genesis of the original “evotis–keenii” study in British Columbia (Canada) was to differentiate Myotis keenii (Merriam, 1895) (Keen’s myotis), with one of the smallest North American bat distributions, from sympatric Myotis evotis (H. Allen, 1864) (long-eared myotis), using something other than the suggested postmortem skull size comparison, but no differentiating trait could be found, leading to the molecular genetics examination of C.L. Lausen et al. (2019). We present cumulative data that rejects the 1979 hypothesis of M. keenii as a distinct species. A.E. Morales et al. (2021) inaccurately portray C.L. Lausen et al.’s (2019) question and results; present inaccurate morphological and outdated distribution data; overstate the impact of homoplasy without supporting evidence; and misinterpret evidence of population structure.",

We tested this hypothesis using population genetic techniques. Using nuclear microsatellite markers (10 loci), we found a lack of differentiation between these two groups of bats (ascribed based on mitochondrial hypervariable region II sequence), suggesting interbreeding was sympatric. Our findings add to the recent discovery that M. l. lucifugus haplotypes are found throughout the range previously thought to be only M. l. carissima, suggesting widespread sympatry and extensively mixed gene pools, thus refuting the cryptic species hypothesis. Clinal morphology and individual variation demonstrated the impossibility to differentiate groups based on original subspecies definitions. The lack of geographic and morphological boundaries, in addition to the likelihood that the interbreeding observed in this study is occurring across western North America, suggests that no line can be drawn between these two groups. We thus suggest that the carissima subspecies designation be dropped. This study highlights the importance of investigating nuclear gene flow in widely sympatric animals suspected of being cryptic genetic species, and has important implications for applications of the DNA Barcoding Project.",

            "abstractNote": "Agricultural expansion and fragmentation of native habitats is considered the major cause of declining biodiversity worldwide, negatively impacting the provision and maintenance of nature’s contributions to people. Bats are a key group in agricultural landscapes, playing crucial ecological roles in pollination, seed dispersal and control of invertebrate populations. Due to interspecific differences in diet, morphology, physiology and behavior, bats differ in habitat use, with a species-specific response to landscape changes. In this study, we evaluated how bats from different trophic guilds that can be catched with mist nets relate to different habitats present in a hyper-fragmented agricultural landscape. With the use of mist nets, we captured 309 bats in 30 nights between June 2016 and July 2018. Our results show differences in habitat use between species of different trophic guilds. While insectivorous bats have a positive relationship with the amount of water present at the collection point, frugivorous bats show a negative response. These results reinforce the importance of landscape heterogeneity in agricultural mosaics for maintaining biodiversity.",

This is the Þrst occurrence of ticks on bats in Canada. This is also the Þrst record of C. kelleyi on M. evotis and M. volans. Dates of parasitization ranged from 22 May to 17 October, and the number of ticks per host ranged from 1 to 44 (median two ticks per host). Number of parasitized individuals was signiÞcantly higher in rock-roosting E. fuscus compared with building-roosting E. fuscus, rock- and building-roosting M. lucifugus, and rock-roosting M. ciliolabrum and M. evotis. A signiÞcant sex bias was noted in rockroosting E. fuscus in 2000 with signiÞcantly more females parasitized. The number of ticks per bat host was highest in 2001, corresponding to the driest and hottest summer of the survey.",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat loss and fragmentation typically lead to species loss and, consequently, changes in the structure and stability of interaction networks. These changes may lead to important limitation of crucial ecosystems services such as seed dispersal. Here, we compared the spatial structure and species composition of bat-fruit interaction networks in continuous and fragmented forests based on the compilation of 14 datasets from the highly diverse and threatened Atlantic Forest sites in Brazil. As predicted, the number of bat-dispersed species was reduced in fragmented forests. Surprisingly, in both continuous and fragmented forests, bat-fruit networks were nested and modular and presented high complementary specialization. Bat species from genera Artibeus, Carollia, and Sturnira, as well as five plant genera (Cecropia, Ficus, Piper, Solanum, and Vismia) played a central role in both continuous and fragmented forests, revealing small effects of habitat loss on the phylogenetic identity of core species. These bats are considerably tolerant to habitat loss and may support seed dispersal of they preferred plants also in fragmented forests, which explains the similarities of the networks between continuous and fragmented forests. In addition, these key plants provide food resources continuously throughout the year, which facilitates the persistence of seed disperser bats year-round in the community. Although our results indicate that habitat loss had little influence on the structure of the bat-fruit interactions, we evidenced that fragmentation reduces the number of resources consumed and dispersed by bats, which may have negative impacts on forest dynamics and ecosystem functioning.",

            "abstractNote": "While functional traits can facilitate or constrain interactions between pair of species in ecological communities, relative abundances regulate the probabilities of encounter among individuals. However, the relative importance of traits and relative abundances for the role species play in seed dispersion networks remains poorly explored. Here, we analyzed 20 Neotropical seed dispersal networks distributed from Mexico to southeastern Brazil to evaluate how relative abundance and functional traits influence bat species’ roles in seed dispersal networks. We tested how bat relative abundance and traits relate to species contribution to between-module (c metric) and within-module connectivity (z metric) and their position and potential to mediate indirect effects between species (betweenness centrality). Our results indicate that relative abundance is the main determinant of the role bats play in the networks, while traits such as aspect ratio show modest yet statistically significant importance in predicting specific roles. Moreover, all seed dispersal networks presented two or three superabundant obligatory frugivore species that interacted with a high number of plants. The modest influence of the functional traits on species’ roles is likely related to the low variation of morphological traits related to foraging ecology, which reduces the chances of morphological mismatching between consumers and resources in the system. In this scenario, abundant bats have higher chances of encountering resources and being capable of consuming them which leads such species to play critical roles in the community by acting as module hubs and network connectors.",

This species is widespread throughout the Neotropics, where it is common in natural areas and also occupies forest patches and cities. In this study, we review the composition of Artibeus lituratus diet in Brazil as well as the size of fruits and seeds, plant geographic origin, and sampling methods used in natural versus urban habitats. We show that Artibeus lituratus is able to consume a higher proportion of exotic fruits with large seeds in urban environments than in natural areas. Fruit diameter was not statistically different between environments, but both fruit and seed diameters are smaller when detected by fecal sampling than by other methods. This difference is likely due to the fact that in natural habitats studies are predominantly based on fecal samples, which hinders the detection of large unswallowed seeds. Consequently, we recommend the use of complementary sampling methods (not only the widely used technique of fecal sorting) in order to produce more accurate descriptions of frugivorous bats’ diets. We suggest that the ability to exploit fruits of exotic plant species including the ones with large seeds may be a key trait for the persistence of A. lituratus in urban habitats.",
