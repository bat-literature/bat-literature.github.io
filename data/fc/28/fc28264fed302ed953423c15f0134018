The populations were situated in the center and at the western and eastern limits of the distribution of R. capensis. The latter two populations were situated in ecotones between vegetation biomes. Ecotone populations deviated slightly from the allometric relationship between body size and peak frequency for the genus, and there was no relationship between these variables within R. capensis. Nasal chamber length was the best predictor of peak frequency but not correlated with body size. The evolution of echolocation thus appears to have been uncoupled from body size in R. capensis. Furthermore, females used higher frequencies than males, which imply a potential social role for peak frequency. The differences in peak frequency may have originated from random founder effects and then compounded by genetic drift and/or natural selection. The latter may have acted directly on peak frequency altering skull parameters involved in echolocation independently of body size, resulting in the evolution of local acoustic signatures.",

It has already been shown that many cells in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus ﬁre regularly in response to monaural stimulation by the best frequency tones. The aim of this study was to ﬁnd how the regularity of units was affected by adding ipsilateral tone, and how interaural intensity difference sensitivity is related to regularity. Single unit recordings were performed from 66 units in the inferior colliculus of the anaesthetized guinea pig in response to the best frequency tone. Regularity of ﬁring was measured by calculating the coefﬁcient of variation as a function of time of a unit’s response. There was a positive correlation between coefﬁcient of variation and interaural intensity difference sensitivity, indicating that highly regular units had very weak and irregular units had strong interaural intensity difference sensitivity responses. Three effects of binaural interaction on the sustained regularity were observed: constant coefﬁcient of variation despite change in rate (66% of the units), negative (20%) and positive (13%) rate–CV relationships. A negative ratecoefﬁcient of variation relationship was the dominant pattern of binaural interaction on the onset regularity.",

To understand the possible role of buzz II, we trained Myotis myotis to land on a vertical grid, and compared the ﬂight and echolocation behavior during approach in trials with and without buzz II. During the approach, we did not ﬁnd any differences in the echolocation behavior until the end of buzz I which indicated whether buzz II was emitted or not. However, bats ﬂying from the periphery of the ﬂight channel, such that they had to make a small turn at the very last moment, ﬁnished the sequence with a buzz II. Bats ﬂying on a rather stereotyped trajectory near the center of the ﬂight channel without last instant corrections emitted buzz I alone. Our results indicate that buzz II occurred only on trajectories that implied a higher risk to fail at landing. The information delivered by buzz II reaches the bat too late to be used for landing. Therefore, we hypothesize that buzz II may help the bats to evaluate unsuccessful attempts and to eventually react adequately.",

Twelve of 61 bats died between November and December 2008 or in May 2009. The bats often displayed multiple yellowewhite nodules in the spleen and liver. Microscopically, these consisted of focal necrosis accompanied by inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration and colonies of gram-negative bacilli. The bacterial colonies were identiﬁed immunohistochemically as Y. pseudotuberculosis O4 and Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype 4b was identiﬁed by bacteriological examination. Polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the isolate harboured the virulence genes virF, inv and ypmA. YPMa is as a superantigenic toxin that is associated with acute systemic infection in man and may contribute to the virulence of Y. pseudotuberculosis in bats. Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT\n            To understand the structural basis of grid cell activity, we compare medial entorhinal cortex architecture in layer 2 across five mammalian species (Etruscan shrews, mice, rats, Egyptian fruit bats, and humans), bridging ∼100 million years of evolutionary diversity. Principal neurons in layer 2 are divided into two distinct cell types, pyramidal and stellate, based on morphology, immunoreactivity, and functional properties. We confirm the existence of patches of calbindin‐positive pyramidal cells across these species, arranged periodically according to analyses techniques like spatial autocorrelation, grid scores, and modifiable areal unit analysis. In rodents, which show sustained theta oscillations in entorhinal cortex, cholinergic innervation targeted calbindin patches. In bats and humans, which only show intermittent entorhinal theta activity, cholinergic innervation avoided calbindin patches. The organization of calbindin‐negative and calbindin‐positive cells showed marked differences in entorhinal subregions of the human brain. Layer 2 of the rodent medial and the human caudal entorhinal cortex were structurally similar in that in both species patches of calbindin‐positive pyramidal cells were superimposed on scattered stellate cells. The number of calbindin‐positive neurons in a patch increased from ∼80 in Etruscan shrews to ∼800 in humans, only an ∼10‐fold over a 20,000‐fold difference in brain size. The relatively constant size of calbindin patches differs from cortical modules such as barrels, which scale with brain size. Thus, selective pressure appears to conserve the distribution of stellate and pyramidal cells, periodic arrangement of calbindin patches, and relatively constant neuron number in calbindin patches in medial/caudal entorhinal cortex.

A total of 108 air samples were collected in June 2014 using the microbiological air sampler “Air Ideal 3P” and Potato Dextrose Agar medium. Fungi were identified based on phenotypic tests and ITS regions analysis. Air samples collected from underground sites contained fewer propagules of fungi (from 86.7 to 126.7 colony-forming units per m3 of air) than outdoor air samples (391.7). Altogether, the incidence of 18 different fungal species were found in the air of the cave, and most of them were isolated from the indoor samples. Cladosporium macrocarpum spores dominated in this study. The fungal species such as Bjerkandera adusta, Exophiala xenobiotica, Fusarium lateritium, Penicillium aurantiacobrunneum, and Trichoderma citrinoviride were detected for the first time in the internal air of underground sites. Overall, fungal air quality of the Demänovská Cave does not pose a biological threat to people and animals with undamaged immune systems according to most standards of fungal sir contamination. However, some of the airborne fungi detected in the cave can pose a risk to persons and animals with weakened immune systems or people who have fungal allergies.",

Air samples from Harmanecka´ Cave had twelve species of fungi, compared to nine species from Driny Cave. Fungal density was higher in guano from Driny Cave (4720.1 CFU/g guano) than from Harmanecka´ Cave (3498.3 CFU/g). The pattern was reversed with fungi from the air. Fungal density in air from Harmanecka´ Cave (211.3 CFU/m3) was higher than that from Driny Cave (175.7 CFU/m3). Penicillium granulatum was the most frequently isolated fungal species, except in the guano of Driny Cave, where Mucor hiemalis was most common. Bat guano is a very good substrate for the development and survival of fungi in the caves, and it can be a reservoir of fungi harmful for bats. However, air samples from both caves contained more species of fungi than the bat guano, because the majority of fungi are transferred to underground ecosystems with air bioaerosols from the external environment.",

            "abstractNote": "More than one-fifth of the documented caves in the United States occur in Tennessee. The obligate subterranean biota of Tennessee is rich and diverse, with 200 troglobionts reported from over 660 caves. Fifty troglobionts are known from just 75 of the 1,469 caves in the Appalachian Valley and Ridge physiographic province of eastern Tennessee. Tennessee’s Valley and Ridge has been under-sampled relative to other karst areas in the state, limiting our knowledge of cave and karst species diversity and distributions and compromising our ability to identify habitats and species potentially at risk from anthropogenic threats, such as urban sprawl near the metropolitan area of Knoxville. Knowledge of nontroglobiontic species inhabiting caves, including vertebrates, is particularly sparse in this region. Although caves have long been recognized as critical habitats for several bat species, the importance of caves for other vertebrate taxa has received less attention. Caves are important habitats for many other nontroglobiontic vertebrates and should be considered in the management and conservation of these species. Our decade-long study bioinventoried 56 caves in 15 counties and begins to address knowledge gaps in distributions and cave use by vertebrates in the Valley and Ridge and adjacent Blue Ridge Mountains of eastern Tennessee within the Appalachians karst region. In addition, we conducted a thorough review of the literature and museum databases for additional species-occurrence records in those provinces of eastern Tennessee. From these sources, we present an annotated list of 54 vertebrate taxa, including 8 fishes, 19 amphibians (8 anurans and 11 salamanders), 6 reptiles, 3 birds, and 18 mammals. Three species are included on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, while six species are at risk of extinction based on NatureServe conservation rank criteria. Ten bat species are known from 109 caves in 24 eastern Tennessee counties. Our bioinventories documented five bat species in 39 caves, including new records of the federally endangered Gray Bat (Myotis grisescens). We observed visible evidence of whitenose syndrome caused by the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans at four caves in Blount, Roane, and Union counties. We documented two new localities of the only troglobiontic vertebrate in the Valley and Ridge, the Berry Cave Salamander (Gyrinophilus gulolineatus). Despite these efforts, significant sampling gaps remain—only 7.7% of known caves in the Valley and Ridge and Blue Ridge Mountains of eastern Tennessee have records of vertebrate-species occurrence. Moreover, few caves in eastern Tennessee have experienced repeated, comprehensive bioinventories, with the exception of periodic surveys of hibernating bats at selected caves. Future bioinventory efforts should incorporate multiple visits to individual caves, if possible, and more efforts should focus on these understudied areas of eastern Tennessee.",

India has a large population of stray dogs which, together with a lack of effective control strategies, might have led to the persistence of rabies virus (RV) in the canine population. Our objective was to study the molecular epidemiology of RV isolates in India based on nucleotide sequence analysis of 29 RV isolates originating from different species of animals in four states. Here we have analyzed two sets of sequence data based upon a 132-nucleotide region of the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the G gene (G-CD) and a 549-nucleotide region (Psi-L) that combines the noncoding G-L intergenic region (Psi) and a fragment of the polymerase gene (L). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RV isolates belong to genotype 1 and that they were related geographically but were not related according to host species. Five different genetic clusters distributed among three geographical regions were identified. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of G-CD between RV isolates revealed three amino acid changes (amino acid 462G [aa462G], aa465H, and aa468K) that distinguished the Indian RVs from RV isolates in other parts of the world. Analysis of the data indicated that the dog rabies virus variants are the major circulating viruses in India that transmit the disease to other domestic animals and humans as well.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats form a diverse order of mammals with a crucial ecological role. Bat populations appear to be declining because of human-induced environmental stress. Genetic methods can contribute to detailed investigations of species diversity and assessments of population status. Here, we aimed to study the genetic diversity of bats across the Rhodope Mountain Range, where species with a large distribution as well as rare species with a limited distribution are found. Βat samples were collected and morphologically identiﬁed within the catchment area of Nestos (Mesta) River and from caves in the region of Momchilgrad – Komotini. Based on the analysis of a mitochondrial COI gene region of 650 bp length, the samples were classiﬁed in 9 distinct genera and 21 species, an important part of Balkan bat species diversity. Miniopterus schreibersii displayed the highest number of haplotypes and Rhinolophus hipposideros the highest mtDNA diversity levels. The majority of the samples were grouped with other European sequences and no speciﬁc geographic distribution of haplotypes was observed, except for Barbastella barbastellus and Hypsugo savii, where a western/eastern divide is apparent. Three species with the highest number of samples were further analyzed using 4-5 microsatellite markers per species. No sign of population diﬀerentiation was found between studied samples for these three species and moderate to high diversity levels were detected for Rhinolophus blasii and Rhinolophus euryale, in contrast to mitochondrial analysis. The results conﬁrm the presence of speciﬁc bat species in the cross-border area of Greece and Bulgaria through genetic identiﬁcation and provide information for levels of genetic variation for some of them that may contribute to future bat management eﬀorts in the region.",

            "abstractNote": "Caves are common roosts used by bats as permanent places for the settlement of stable colonies because caves are minimally affected by environmental conditions. Although Venezuela is a cave-rich country, with almost 700 caves formally described in the 2006 speleological inventory, these are still unknown in terms of their whole biological composition. Particular groups of animals have been described for some of these caves, but a list of culturable proteobacteria found inside any cave in the country has never been reported. During an inventory of bats in a small cave within a recreational park, we decided to perform a first look at the diversity of its bacteria and determine whether some of them have been reported as present in other caves, other environments, or even bats. Identification of bacteria was possible by amplifying and sequencing 16S rRNA genes from cultivated samples. Twenty-three clonal samples of bacteria from Cueva Las Escaleras (Pregonero, Ta´chira state, Venezuela) were obtained and analyzed. All but one sample belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria, and most of them have been reported to be potentially pathogenic to humans. From these identified bacteria, some (Achromobacter denitrificans, Proteus mirabilis, and Microvirgula aerodenitrificans) showed resistance to five widely used antibiotics. These results are important, as some bacteria found inside this cave may contaminate the water that flows from the cave and runs to the stream that crosses the park, forming ponds that surround lunch places. We detected a potential threat for public health at local and regional scales because many visitors use this water for drinking and washing hands and faces, and the cave itself is used for urination, defecation, and sexual activities.",

This specialization is generally inferred when ﬂowers that are only exposed to the activity of nocturnal visitors set fruit and seed. Although moths are also common visitors to the ﬂowers of columnar cacti at night, it is generally thought that their contribution to the reproductive success of this cactus is negligible. Using selective exclusions, we assessed the contribution of bats and moths to the reproductive success in a population of Pilosocereus leucocephalus in central Mexico. Fruit set was 100% for bat-pollinated ﬂowers and 34% in mothpollinated ﬂowers. Seed number per fruit was 1473 in bat-pollinated and 836 in moth pollinated ﬂowers. Our results clearly show that in addition to bats, moths are eﬀective pollinators of Pilosocereus leucocephalus in the study area. Therefore, bats are the main pollinators of P. leucocephalus, and moths are the secondary pollinators.",

Most of these models examine size evolution across a wide range of islands in order to test which island characteristics inﬂuence evolutionary pathways. Here, we examine the mammalian fauna of a single island, Borneo, where previous work has detected that some mammal species have evolved a relatively small size. We test whether Borneo is characterized by smaller mammals than adjacent areas, and examine possible causes for the different trajectories of size evolution between different Bornean species.",

They have portrayed our recent analysis as weakly supporting the island rule, seeing weakness in our use of what they considered to be inadequate size indices (skulls and teeth, rather than mass or body length) and in our use of large islands. They argue that size evolution on islands points to a bauplan-speciﬁc fundamental size. We aim to test the generality of the rule and the adequacy of some of the data used to support it.",

            "abstractNote": "Arid and semiarid environments of the world are characterized by extreme environmental changes that affect the availability of scarce, patchily distributed resources such as water. In response to these changes, animals migrate or partition resources to minimize competition, resulting in temporal patterns within assemblages across mul­ tiple scales. Here, we demonstrate that the winter dry season bat assemblage in a semiarid grassland of north­ western India exhibits seasonal changes and temporal avoidance between coexisting species. Using a passive acoustic monitoring framework to quantify activity patterns at different points in the season, we show that members of this assemblage (Rhinolophus lepidus and Tadarida aegyptiaca) exhibit seasonal differences in activity, being more frequently detected in the early and late parts of the dry season, respectively. Other species (Pipis­ trellus tenuis and Scotophilus heathii) do not exhibit seasonal changes in activity, but structure diel activity pat­ terns, minimizing temporal overlap (and thus competition) at water bodies. These data, some of the first on bats from this region, demonstrate the complex temporal patterns structuring bat assemblages in arid and semiarid biomes. Our results hold promise both in understanding bat behavioral ecology and in long-term monitoring efforts.",

            "abstractNote": "Burrows are engineered shelters providing crucial refuge and protection against temperature extremes, ﬁre and predation. Understanding the ecological role of them in terms of providing habitats to other animals is very signiﬁcant. Burrowing animal assemblages occur in almost all landscapes, particularly in arid and semi-arid habitats. The present work was carried out to understand external and internal burrow features and to identify the factors determining the animal assemblage. A total of 44 burrow systems were located in Keoladeo National Park, India. External burrow characteristics such as: number of openings, inter-opening distances, size and opening orientation were collected. The internal architecture (n ¼ 9) of the burrow systems was studied using a burrow video camera. The internal characteristics such as: dimensions of tunnels and chambers, total length, number of branches, and distance between chambers were collected. Degree of convolution and Reichman's index were used to determine the complexity and linearity. Camera traps and a burrow video camera were used to determine the presence of animals dwelling inside. The burrow systems had a looping structure with a mean total length of 13.33 ± 6.51 m. Burrow systems were co-occupied by four vertebrate species; Indian crested porcupine, golden jackal, leaf-nosed bat and Indian rock python. All the animals except porcupines, were observed to occupy burrows based on speciﬁc burrow characters, wherein jackals occupied burrows with larger chambers, pythons occurred in smaller compact chambers and bats occupied burrows with fewer branching and openings. The occupancy of Indian crested porcupine and gecko did not show any signiﬁcant correlation with burrow characters. Occupancy of jackal was positively correlated (r ¼ 0.72, P < 0.05) and python was negatively correlated (r ¼ À0.82, P < 0.01) with mean chamber height. Bats showed a signiﬁcant negative correlation with number of branches (r ¼ À0.69, P < 0.05) and number of openings (r ¼ À0.85, P < 0.01).",

Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co‐evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti‐bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free‐living bat–insect community.

Predictive prey‐selection models that included high‐efficacy estimates for eared‐moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared‐moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light‐induced, decreased eared‐moth defensive behaviour.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Policy implications\n                    . In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth‐eating bats and eared moths will face ever‐increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad‐spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth‐friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth‐eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth‐eating bats and eared moths will face ever‐increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively.

            "abstractNote": "Great part of ecological thought in desert ecology is based on research ﬁndings in the northern hemisphere, and these have led to generalizations to other drylands. However, South American aridlands constitute an important scenario of aridland evolution in the Neotropical temperate biota. The degree of distinctiveness of the South American dryland biota is the result of the history of lineages and place (diverse topography, climates, vegetation) in the southern part of the continent since the Oligocene. The aim of our contribution is to provide an updated review of some aspects of the latest biogeographical, ecological, physiological, and behavioral research of the Monte Desert mammals and reassessment of their evolutionary ecology. The temperate Monte Desert extends from 24  to 43  south latitude and resembles parts of the North American warm deserts. The Monte is a heterogeneous mosaic of landscapes, from open sand dune habitats to Larrea shrublands and dense vegetation patches of Prosopis woodlands. The mammal assemblages show variations in richness, diversity and endemicity. The structure of mammal assemblages is closely related to vegetation structure over different spatial scales. The Monte mammal assemblages show a great diversity of niche types and ecological, physiological and behavioral attributes for desert existence, convergent, in greater or lesser degree, with ecological counterparts from other deserts of the world. We point out the need to be cautious when comparing heterogeneous arid ecosystems.",

One reason for this may be because\n                    AES\n                    tend to be administered at the farm scale.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We argue that collaborative\n                    AES\n                    (\n                    cAES\n                    ) – single environmental management agreements for multiple farm units – can benefit biodiversity. We then discuss how a shift to this type of scheme may impact upon ecosystem services (\n                    ES\n                    ).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Evidence gathered from studies carried out across\n                    E\n                    uropean farmland demonstrated that more than a third (18 of 52; 35%) of the bird, mammal, reptile, amphibian and bumblebee species important in English farmland operate at scales larger than the typical\n                    E\n                    nglish farm (146 ha) in the breeding season.

Eighty‐one per cent of interviewees were found to be willing, in principle, to participate in a collaborative\n                    AES\n                    (c\n                    AES\n                    ) programme. However, they viewed less extensive options (e.g. management of existing hedgerows) more favourably than extensive or cooperatively demanding land management options (e.g. large‐scale habitat creation). Data from an online consultation of a further 122 farmers supported the principal finding, with 75% of respondents willing, in theory, to participate in collaborative schemes.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    .

It has been shown theoretically that number of individuals is an unbiased effort unit when density varies among sites, although our results with bats do not prove this.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We compared our results using nights and individuals as measures of effort in bat species accumulation curves, but did not detect changes in the estimated richness using the two measures.\n                \n                \n                  We maintain our position about the utility of species accumulation curves as practical tools for inventory assessment, even for very diverse groups. To compare curves from different sites, we agree that number of individuals may be an unbiased measure of effort. But to give practical recommendations for sampling, we suggest that effort also be expressed in standard sampling units.",

We then examined to what degree high sample representativeness (\n                    r\n                     ≥ 0·8) was influenced by biogeographic region, sampling method, sampling effort or structural assemblage characteristics.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    For\n                    SR\n                    , correlations between random subsets and original data sets were strong (\n                    r\n                     ≥ 0·8) with moderate (ca. 20%) species loss. Bias associated with information loss was greater for species composition; on average ca. 90% of species in random subsets had to be retained to adequately capture among‐site variation. For nonrandom subsets, removing only the rarest species (on average\n                    c\n                    . 10% of the full data set) yielded strong correlations (\n                    r\n                     > 0·95) for both\n                    SR\n                    and composition. Eliminating greater proportions of rare species resulted in weaker correlations and large variation in the magnitude of observed correlations among data sets.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Species subsets that comprised ca. 85% of the original set can be considered reliable surrogates, capable of adequately revealing patterns of\n                    SR\n                    and temporal or spatial turnover in many tropical bat assemblages. Our analyses thus demonstrate the potential as well as limitations for reducing survey effort and streamlining sampling protocols, and consequently for increasing the cost‐effectiveness in tropical bat surveys or monitoring programmes. The dependence of the performance of species subsets on structural assemblage characteristics (total assemblage abundance, proportion of rare species), however, underscores the importance of adaptive monitoring schemes and of establishing surrogate performance on a site by site basis based on pilot surveys.",

Urban habitat islands are known as biodiversity hotspots and assist conservation in fragmented city landscapes for animals. The Batu Caves complex offer a unique condition as it houses caves that offer refuge for roosting bats out of the twenty explored caves. The most extensive cave complex is the Dark Cave with more than 2000m of surveyed passages. In this study, we compared the temporal changes of bat species diversity in the habitat island of Batu Caves. Species occurrence data was compiled using a bibliographic search in literature databases and compared with a site survey conducted in 2019 using visual, echolocation and LIDAR methods. Result of the comparison showed that there is a significant decline in bat species occurrences and diversity from previous record of eight species to only four species found roosting in the Dark Cave during our survey in 2019. The showed a decline of the number of roosting bat species especially in the Dark Cave of the habitat island Batu Caves.",

            "abstractNote": "Although bats carry out important beneficial ecological and agricultural functions such as pollination and dispersion of seeds, they often carry dangerous diseases. This is worrying because of the increased dependency of the urban populations in Kisangani on bats as a source of animal proteins. The straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is one of the most notable bat species that is both important as a food source and as a host for zoonotic diseases. It is a widely distributed species, which is relatively common throughout its distribution area. Recently, it was classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List due to a decreasing population trend. To evaluate the hunting pressure on this species and the supply of straw-coloured fruit bats for human consumption, we inventoried the carcasses of this species on one of the main bushmeat markets in the region of Kisangani, situated on the island of Maele. Our survey was carried out between January and December 2013 and targeted hunters as well as traders. In total, we counted 3,034 carcasses. Our preliminary results suggest that the hunting pressure on the straw-coloured fruit bat is rather stable. It is highest during the months of October, September and May and lowest in April and December. Our results do not show a decline in trade of these bats during August through November, when hunting is illegal in the DR Congo. This suggests that hunting activities are not ceased during that period. The fact that the local population consumes these bats on a regular basis throughout the year creates a very important opportunity for spill-over events that may lead to the outbreaks of zoonotic diseases.",

            "abstractNote": "Surveys on Roundleaf bats (Hipposideridae) were conducted at 18 forest reserves in nine CFS ecological corridor networks namely Pedu, Bukit Saiong, Kenderong, Bintang Hijau, Sungai Betis, Sungai Brok, Tembat, Tanum, Sungai Yu, Ulu Jelai, Bukit Bujang, Angsi, Berembun, Labis Timur, Mersing, Lenggor Tengah, Panti and Ulu Sedili FRs. This study mainly aims to record the presence of Hipposideridae at the selected forest reserves. The surveys started from February 2018 until August 2020. A total of three harp traps were set up in each forest reserve, except for Ulu Jelai, Tembat and Berembun FRs with six harp traps. Overall, 67 individuals comprising seven species from genus Hipposideros were recorded in this study. Hipposideros bicolor was the most widely distributed species recorded in nine forest reserves whereas, Hipposideros larvatus is the most abundance species recorded in this study with 25 individuals. Kenderong and Bintang Hijau FRs recorded the highest number of Hipposideridae species in this study, both with four species. The presence of Hipposiderids in this study might be associated with their suitable roosting and foraging areas as well as availability of food sources. Therefore, this information gives an early insight on Hipposideridae distribution and habitat requirement at the forest reserves in CFS ecological corridor landscapes that stakeholders need to consider in establishing the corridors. More sampling efforts need to put in this study, covering more areas in the forest reserves with longer sampling periods and more number of traps used in order to really identify critical corridors for bat conservations.",

In the pars distalis of T. longimanus, STH cells are round to oval with eccentrically placed nucleus, numerous secretory granules and well developed Golgi indicate a cell under vigorous synthetic activity while those filled with secretory granules with reduced Golgi complex suggest reserve or storage state of cells. LTH cell is characterized by the large secretory granules, dilated endoplasmic reticulum and numerous mitochondria in the cytoplasm which indicate that these cells are hypertrophied and synthetically very active during pregnancy. ACTH cells are found either singly or in groups and are elongated or angular with long cytoplasmic processes. The size and peripheral arrangement of secretory granules are characteristic of ACTH cell. TSH cells are distributed mostly towards the periphery of the pars distalis of T. longimanus. They are elongated, polygonal or triangular in shape. The secretory granules are small, electron dense, 150-200 nm in diameter. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is very well developed. In FSH, the secretory granules are small (200 to 400 nm) and less in number and are distributed towards the periphery of the cell. FSH cells show well developed mitochondria, Golgi and rough endoplasmic reticulum indicating active state of FSH during estrus and pregnancy. The hypertrophy of FSH and LH cells during pregnancy is associated with filigreed cytoplasmic pattern giving a bizarre appearance. At late pregnancy, FSH and LH cells are highly active and synthesize large quantities of hormone as indicated by the development of cell organelles.",

Cyclic histological changes during the seasonal breeding quiescence cycle are not well marked. There are no marked differences. The ultrastructural characteristic of the secretory epithelial cells of BulboUretrhal Gland gland have been studied during different phases of reproductive cycle. The secretory epithelial cells are characterized by the well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, extensive developed complexus golgiensis (Golgi apparatus) and mitochondria. Mitochondria with lamellate cristae are dispersed in the cytoplasm. Three different types of secretory granules can be identified on the basis of electron density. These granules are not of different types but they represent the different stages of granule maturation. The secretory products of bulbo-urethral gland of bat are released into lumen both by apocrine and merocrine modes. The functional significance of the secretions of the bulbo-urethral glands in reproduction is discussed.",

This investigation aims at comparatively elucidating any adaptational changes the ileum of the three mammals must have adopted to meet its dietary requirements and also cope with their morphological differences. The investigation was carried out using ten rats, ten bats and ten pangolins of both sexes. The animals were slightly anaesthetized under chloroform inhalation. The intestines were harvested and the ileum excised and fixed in 10% formol saline. The tissues were processed for light microscopic study. The following stains were employed: Haematoxylin and eosin (H & E), Van Gieson and Verhoeff’s haematoxylin elastic tissue stain. Stained slides were also analysed morphometrically. The results revealed microstructural modifications which characterized the mucosa as well as the pattern of distribution of the conjuntive tissue fibers in the ileum of the three mammals. These modifications are means of successfully coping with their respective diets and morphological differences.",

Fruit bats are the likely reservoir, and human infection occurs through contact with bats or infected large-animal carcasses or by person-to-person contact (through body ﬂuids, medical care, and burial practices). Schematically, clinical manifestations occur in three successive phases and include general, gastrointestinal, and mucocutaneous disorders. Death usually results from hemorrhagic complications. Cutaneous manifestations rarely make a major contribution to disease severity but can assist with the diagnosis. Rash, the main cutaneous disorder, is nonspeciﬁc and cannot guide the differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemical examination of skin biopsy or necropsy specimens can conﬁrm the diagnosis.",

The El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) were retrieved from Korean Meteorological Administration. We used the deﬁnition of El Nino as the positive sea surface temperature anomalies (≥0.5 ◦C), while La Nina events are negative anomalies (≤-0.5 ◦C) of 3 months moving average. The weeks with the highest activities of inﬂuenza A and B in each season were identiﬁed and compared according to the presence of the anomalies. The pandemic season of 2009/2010 was excluded from the analysis. We used the mid-p exact test for statistical signiﬁcance.\nResults: From 2005 to July 2018, there were 3 El Nino events and 5 La Nina events by the ENSO. The inﬂuenza A peak activity in study periods showed at 4.6(±4.2) and 3.6(±4.6) epidemic week in Korea and USA, respectively. However, in the season of La Nina, the peak activities of inﬂuenza A observed at 0.8(±1.4) and 5.6(±3.9) epidemic week in Korea and USA, respectively. The La Nina was associated with the early annual peak in Korea (p = 0.045, mid-p exact test) and the El Nino was associated delayed the annual peak in USA (p = 0.09, mid-p exact test). The peak activity of inﬂuenza B showed no statistical association with ENSO in both countries.\nConclusion: Both El Nino and La Nina affect the timing of inﬂuenza A peak activity, but the direction may be the opposite across the Paciﬁc Ocean: ENSO associated the early emergency of",

However, signiﬁcant knowledge gaps remain regarding these antagonistic interactions, especially since diverse factors such as seasonality and host sex can affect their network structures. Here, we explore the inﬂuence of such factors by comparing species richness and composition of bat ﬂies on host bats, as well as specialization and modularity of bat–bat ﬂy interaction networks between seasons and adult host sexes. We captured bats and collected their ectoparasitic ﬂies at 10 sampling sites in the savannahs of Amapá State, northeastern region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite female bats being more parasitized and recording greater bat ﬂy species richness in the wet season, neither relationship was statistically signiﬁcant. The pooled network could be divided into 15 compartments with 54 links, and all subnetworks comprised >12 compartments. The total number of links ranged from 27 to 48 (for the dry and wet seasons, respectively), and female and male subnetworks had 44 and 41 links, respectively. Connectance values were very low for the pooled network and for all subnetworks. Our results revealed higher bat ﬂy species richness and abundance in the wet season, whereas specialization and modularity were higher in the dry season. Moreover, the subnetwork for female bats displayed higher specialization and modularity than the male subnetwork. Therefore, both seasonality and host sex contribute in different ways to bat–bat ﬂy network structure. Future studies should consider these factors when evaluating bat–bat ﬂy interaction networks.",

Bartonella bacteria were isolated from 12/50 (24%) of bats examined. Analyses of sequence similarities of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) and RNA polymerase beta-subunit-encoding (rpoB) gene indicated that the isolates from M. fuliginosus were distinct from those present in known Bartonella species as the levels of similarity for both of the genes were lower than the cut-oﬀ values for species identiﬁcation in Bartonella. A phylogenetic analysis of the gltA sequences revealed that the Miniopterus bat-associated strains fell into ﬁve genotypes (I to V). Though genotypes I to IV formed a clade with Bartonella from Miniopterus bats from Taiwan, genotype V made a monophyletic clade separate from other bat isolates. In a phylogenetic analysis with the concatenated sequences of the 16S rRNA, gltA, rpoB, cell division protein (ftsZ) gene, and riboﬂavin synthase gene (ribC), isolates belonging to genotypes I to IV clustered with Bartonella strains from Taiwanese Miniopterus bats, similar to the outcome of the phylogenetic analysis with gltA, whereas genotype V also made a monophyletic clade separate from other bat-associated Bartonella strains. The present study showed that M. fuliginosus in Japan harbor both genus Miniopterus-speciﬁc Bartonella suggesting to be speciﬁc to the bats in Japan.",

Not only can animals serve as valuable sentinels for emerging zoonoses but also much can be gained by the study of the animals themselves.",

Anthropization has several important effects on animal communities and the Brazilian Cerrado, a Neotropical savannah, has been severely affected by human activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate phyllostomid bat assemblage distributions in the different landscape formations of a modified savannah. Using mist nets, we performed 36 sampling nights between 2015 and 2016. The sampling effort was 23,328 m².h and was equally distributed over three landscape formations: a large fragment, riparian forest, and small fragments. We compared capture rates, richness, diversity, similarity, and feeding guilds for the three formations. We captured 418 bats of 12 species belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. The most abundant species was Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823) (n = 126). We found no significant differences in capture rate or diversity between the areas, but there were differences in feeding guild representation. Frugivores species were the most abundant in the three areas. No gleaning insectivore or carnivore species were captured in the small fragments, and the large fragment contained no hematophages. The large fragment and the small fragments had the greatest similarity whereas the riparian forest and small fragments had the least similarity.",

We carried out ten sampling sessions in 2013 at Bom Retiro Farm: five in a forested area, located inside the forest, and five in an open area, approximately 600 m away from each other. The same capture effort was used in both areas, and collection has always been carried out on the same day in both areas. The forested area was more diverse, being captured 256 bats, all of Phyllostomidae, belonging to 14 species; Carollia perspicillata (n = 112), Sturnira lilium (n = 46), Desmodus rotundus (n = 25), were the most captured. In the open area we captured 153 individuals of four families: Phyllostomidae was represented by Carollia perspicillata (n=52), Desmodus rotundus (n=39), Artibeus lituratus (n=24), the most captured. A higher diversity in forested area ( Hʼ 1.812 ), where there should be more resources and shelters, and consequently more protection.",

Urbanization has impacted bat communities and their ecosystemic services in various regions of the world. However, this impact has been few studied in the Neotropic. In Brazil, although urban bat inventories are scarce, public health organs (e.g., Zoonoses Control Center) perform passive surveillance of infected bats by the rabies virus. These institutions carry out bat identification and collect biologic data essentials to the environment management, population control, ecology, and bat conservation. The present study analyzed bat data (from 2001 to 2017) recorded in Guarulhos city, which integers São Paulo metropolitan region. We compared bat receivement rate, richness, and dominance with other studies. The health surveillance data demonstrated high species richness (n = 29), represented by the three bat families most commonly recorded in Brazilian cities (Phyllostomidae, Molossidadae and Vespertilionidae). Molossus molossus (Pallas, 1766), Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766) and Myotis nigricans (Schinz, 1821) represented most bat data (70%) from Guarulhos city. This dominance can be explained by the diet flexibility (insectivores and non-obligate nectarivores) and shelter occupation in buildings of these species, resources highly available in cities. The understood of the urban characteristics associated with urban bat dominance is important by the provide insights on how to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on the richest regional bat community. Thus, it is recommended that citiesʼ environmental planning consider urbanistic and floristic guidelines as a tool integrated for wild life and public health management, and implement strategies to increase the conservation potential in urban ecosystems.",

            "abstractNote": "Many studies have demonstrated the ecological relevance and great biodiversity of bats in Brazil. However, mountainous areas have been disproportionately less sampled, mainly in the Southeast. The aim of this study was to identify and compare the richness and diversity of Phyllostomidae, the most diverse bat family, in different forest types in Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca, trying to understand the causes of possible differences. The Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca is inserted in the Serra da Mantiqueira’s domain, in an Atlantic Forest region known as “Zona da Mata”, state of Minas Gerais, with an altitudinal range between 1200-1784 meters. The study was conducted in two forest types, classified as “Nanofloresta Nebular” and “Floresta Nebular”, whose respective data on richness and diversity were compared. The bats were captured with 8-10 mist nets for 14 months (April 2011 to May 2012) and four nights per month totaling 62,171.25 m2h of capture effort. A total of 392 captures (12 species) belonging to the Phyllostomidae family were obtained. The most abundant species were Sturnira lilium (59.9%), Platyrrhinus lineatus (11.3%), Artibeus lituratus (8.7%) and Carollia perspicillata (7.6%). The two sampled areas presented differences in bat richness, diversity and species composition, and this difference was predominantly influenced by S. lilium. It is likely that the observed difference in the assembly of bats between the two study sites depends on the variation in floristic composition. The records of A. lituratus and P. lineatus in a few months of the year and close to Ficus mexiae bearing ripe fruits suggests that at least these species move to the park for a few periods of the year in search of food resources, possibly moving through the altitudinal landscapes.",
