            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.\\n\\nRESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.",

We examined several aspects of the intestinal immune system in summer (non-hibernating) and hibernating ground squirrels. Peyer's patches were largely unaffected by hibernation, but numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and lamina propria leukocytes (LPL) were greater in hibernators compared with summer. Hibernator IEL were less mature as demonstrated by low numbers of cells expressing activation-associated markers and co-receptors. Compared with summer, the percentage of B cells was higher and percentage of T cells was lower in the hibernator LPL. Hibernation was associated with greater mucosal levels of IFN-??, TNF-??, IL-10 and IL-4, but IL-6 and TGF-?? were unchanged. Mucosal IgA levels were greater in entrance and torpid hibernators compared with summer. The results suggest that modifications of the intestinal immune system during hibernation may help preserve gut integrity throughout the winter fast. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "Winter is energetically demanding. Physiological and behavior adaptations have evolved among nontropical animals to cope with winter because thermoregulatory demands increase when food availability decreases. Seasonal breeding is central within the suite of winter adaptations among small animals. Presumably, reproductive inhibition during winter conserves energy at a time when the odds of producing viable young are low. In addition to the well-studied seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many populations of mammals and birds in the field. Challenging winter conditions, such as low ambient temperatures and decreased food availability, can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation, or shock. In some cases, survival in demanding winter conditions puts individuals under great physiological stress, defined here as an adaptive process that results in elevated blood levels of glucocorticoids. The stress of coping with energetically demanding conditions can also indirectly cause illness and death by compromising immune function. Presumably, the increased blood concentrations of adrenocortical steroids in response to winter stressors compromise immune function and accelerate catabolic mechanisms in the field, although the physiological effects of elevated glucocorticoids induced by artificial stressors have been investigated primarily in the laboratory. However, recurrent environmental stressors could reduce survival if they evoke persistent glucocorticoid secretion. The working hypothesis of this article is that mechanisms have evolved in some animals to cambat seasonal stress-induced immunocompromise as a temporal adaptation to promote survival. Furthermore, we hypothesize that mechanisms have evolved that allow individuals to anticipate periods of immunologically challenging conditions, and to cope with these seasonal health-threatening conditions. The primary environmental cue that permits physiological anticipation of season is the daily photoperiod; however, other environmental factors may interact with photoperiod to affect immune function and disease processes. The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in lymphatic organ size, structure, immune function, and disease processes, and their possible interactions with recurrent environmental stressor, is reviewed. Seasonal peaks of lymphatic organ size and structure generally occur in late autumn or early winter and seasonal minima are oberved prior to the onset of breeding. Although many of the field data suggest that immune function and disease processes are also enhanced during the winter, the opposite seasonal pattern is also observed in some studies. We propose that compromised immune function may be observed in some populations during particularly harsh winters when stressors override the enhancement of immune function evoked by short day lenghts. Because so many factors covary in field studies, assessment of our proposal that photoperiod mediates seasonal changes in immune function requires laboratory studies in which only photoperiod is varied. A review of the effects of photoperiod on immune function in laboratory studies reveals that exposure to short day lengths enhances immune function in every species examined. Short day exposure in small mammals causes reproductive inhibition and concomitant reduction in plasma levels of prolactin and steroid hormones, as well as alterations in the temporal pattern of pineal melatonin secretion. These hormones effect immune function, and influence the development of opportunistic disease, including cancer; however, it appears that either prolactin or melatonin secretion is responsible for mediating the effects of photoperiod on immune function. Taken together, day length appears to affect immune function in many species, including animals that typically do not exhibit reproductive responsiveness to day length. These data could have a major impact on understanding the etiology and progression of diseases in humans and nonhuman animals. The clinical significance of these data is also considered.",

            "abstractNote": "Assessing the reliability of experimental replicates (or global alterations corresponding to different experimental conditions) is a critical step in analyzing RNA-Seq data. Pearson’s correlation coefficient r has been widely used in the RNA-Seq field even though its statistical characteristics may be poorly suited to the task. Here we present a single-parameter test procedure for count data, the Simple Error Ratio Estimate (SERE), that can determine whether two RNA-Seq libraries are faithful replicates or globally different. Benchmarking shows that the interpretation of SERE is unambiguous regardless of the total read count or the range of expression differences among bins (exons or genes), a score of 1 indicating faithful replication (i.e., samples are affected only by Poisson variation of individual counts), a score of 0 indicating data duplication, and scores >1 corresponding to true global differences between RNA-Seq libraries. On the contrary the interpretation of Pearson’s r is generally ambiguous and highly dependent on sequencing depth and the range of expression levels inherent to the sample (difference between lowest and highest bin count). Cohen’s simple Kappa results are also ambiguous and are highly dependent on the choice of bins. For quantifying global sample differences SERE performs similarly to a measure based on the negative binomial distribution yet is simpler to compute. SERE can therefore serve as a straightforward and reliable statistical procedure for the global assessment of pairs or large groups of RNA-Seq datasets by a single statistical parameter.",

The other nonhuman primate species, however, had negative or low levels of anti-HTLV-I antibodies. STLV-I pol and env DNA was detected in 12 of 12 different animals among the seropositive species. However, STLV-I pX DNA could be detected in only 10 of 12 animals. Comparative phylogenetic analyses based on 140 bp sequence of the pol gene indicate that these STLV-I isolates were 0-9% divergent from each other and were 3.5-7% divergent from the prototype related human retrovirus HTLV-I (ATK). The West African STLV-I isolates formed a unique phylogenetic cluster as did most of the Central African STLV-I isolates, save for STLV-I (Tan 90). The phylogenetic data indicate that cross species transmission of HTLV-I and STLV-I continued to occur long after their ancestral strain separated from the progenitor to HTLV-II. Comparative amino acid analyses indicated that there was marked conservation of the TAX protein regardless of host species, while the pol and REX proteins exhibited increasing levels of diversity.",

            "abstractNote": "It is now known that all human retroviruses have a non-human primate counterpart. It has been reported that the presence of these retroviruses in humans is the result of interspecies transmission. Several authors have described the passage of a simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), from primates to humans. To better understand this retroviral \"zoonosis\" in natural settings, we evaluated the presence of SFV in both captive and wild non-human primates and in humans at high risk, such as hunters and people bitten by a non-human primate, in Gabon, central Africa. A high prevalence of SFV was found in blood samples from non-human primates and in bush meat collected across the country. Mandrills were found to be highly infected with two distinct strains of SFV, depending on their geographical location. Furthermore, samples collected from hunters and non-human primate laboratory workers showed clear, extensive cross-species transmission of SFV. People who had been bitten by mandrills, gorillas and chimpanzees had persistent SFV infection with low genetic drift. Thus, SFV is presumed to be transmitted from non-human primates mainly through severe bites, involving contact between infected saliva and blood. In this review, we summarize and discuss our five-year observations on the prevalence and dissemination of SFV in humans and non-human primates in Gabon.",

Two animals (a Mandrillus sphinx and a Cercocebus agilis) exhibited a complete HTLV-1 seroreactivity pattern while two others lacked either the p24 (a Mandrillus sphinx) or the MTA-1/gp46 bands (a Pan troglodytes). Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses, using a 522 bp env gene fragment and the complete LTR, indicated that the two mandrill STLV strains belonged to the HTLV/STLV subtype D clade while the chimpanzee strain clustered in the HTLV/STLV subtype B clade. The Cercocebus agilis STLV strain, the first one found in this species, was closely related to the two HTLV/STLV subtype F strains. Such data indicate that the African biodiversity of STLV-1 in the wild is far from being known and reinforces the hypothesis of interspecies transmission of STLV-1 from monkeys and apes to humans leading to the present day distribution of HTLV-1 in African inhabitants.",

Similarly, it was unclear which specimens would be best for virus testing. Monkeypox DNA was detected in at least 33 animals, and virus was cultured from 22. Virus-positive animals included three African species associated with the importation event (giant pouched rats, Cricetomys spp.; rope squirrels, Funisciuris sp.; and dormice, Graphiuris sp.). Virologic evidence from North American prairie dogs (Cynomys sp.) was concordant with their suspected roles as vectors for human monkeypox. Multiple tissues were found suitable for DNA detection and/or virus isolation. These data extend the potential host range for monkeypox virus infection and supports concern regarding the potential for establishment in novel reservoir species and ecosystems.",

            "abstractNote": "Since monkeypox virus was discovered in animals in 1958 and in man in 1971, several efforts have been made to identify the reservoir of the virus in nature. In July 1985 a study on human environments and animals suspected to maintain virus transmission was carried out in northern Zaire. The study revealed three well demarcated areas: the human settlement area, the agricultural area and the primary tropical rain forest. The first two were found inhabited by terrestrial and arboreal rodents and bats, while the larger animals have abandoned them. Data on human morbidity collected in the preceding years suggested that most of the patients were infected either in the settlement or in the agricultural area. Isolation of the virus from a squirrel confirmed this suggestion and proved, on the other hand, that the virus could circulate in an area deprived of the larger wild animals, including primates. The virus isolation and results of serologic testing suggest that out of three groups of animals inhabiting the agricultural area, the squirrels Funisciurus anerythrus should be considered a priority candidate to sustain virus transmission.",

Six persons were found to be affected in a Pygmy camp with an estimated population of 50 residents. In the two affected families, out of 11 members, only unvaccinated children and a 22 year old unvaccinated woman contracted the disease. The disease was of moderate severity in two patients and very mild in the other four. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by virus isolation from skin lesions of 4 patients and by sero-immunologic tests in all of them. The clinically apparent monkeypox case reported in the Central African Republic in 1983, the presently described outbreak, as well as information on the disease obtained from Pygmies and missionary paramedical staff who are in frequent contact with them, suggest that monkeypox is enzootic in the tropical rain forest in the south-west areas of the Central African Republic.",

How can a fungal skin infection kill such a broad range of amphibian hosts? And do different host species have a similar response to Bd infection? Here, we use a genomics approach to understand the genetic response of multiple susceptible frog species to Bd infection. We characterize the transcriptomes of two closely related endangered frog species (Rana muscosa and Rana sierrae) and analyse whole genome expression profiles from frogs in controlled Bd infection experiments. We integrate the Rana results with a comparable data set from a more distantly related susceptible species (Silurana tropicalis). We demonstrate that Bd-infected frogs show massive disruption of skin function and show no evidence of a robust immune response. The genetic response to infection is shared across the focal susceptible species, suggesting a common effect of Bd on susceptible frogs.",

Five had been bitten by gorillas and were infected with subtype B strains; however, a 12-year-old girl who was severely bitten by a Cercopithecus nictitans was infected with a subtype D strain that was closely related to the simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV-1) that infects this monkey species. Her mother was infected with a subtype B strain. These data confirm that hunters in Africa can be infected by HTLV-1 that is closely related to the strains circulating among local NHP game. Our findings strongly suggest that a severe bite represent a risk factor for STLV-1 acquisition.",

            "abstractNote": "Multihost parasites have been implicated in the emergence of new diseases in humans and wildlife, yet little is known about factors that influence the host range of parasites in natural populations. We used a comprehensive data set of 415 micro- and macroparasites reported from 119 wild primate hosts to investigate broad patterns of host specificity. The majority (68%) of primate parasites were reported to infect multiple host species, including animals from multiple families or orders. This pattern corresponds to previous studies of parasites found in humans and domesticated animals. Within three parasite groups (viruses, protozoans and helminths), we examined parasite taxonomy and transmission strategy in relation to measures of host specificity. Relative to other parasite groups, helminths were associated with the greatest levels of host specificity, whereas most viruses were reported to infect hosts from multiple families or orders. Highly significant associations between the degree of host specificity and transmission strategy arose within each parasite group, but not always in the same direction, suggesting that unique constraints influence the host range of parasites within each taxonomic group. Finally characteristics of over 100 parasite species shared between wild primates and humans, including those recognised as emerging in humans, revealed that most of these shared parasites were reported from multiple host orders. Furthermore, nearly all viruses that were reported to infect both humans and non-human primates were classified as emerging in humans.",

            "abstractNote": "Golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) undergo seasonal hibernation during which core body temperature (T(b)) values are maintained 1-2 degrees C above ambient temperature. Hibernation is not continuous. Squirrels arouse at approximately 7-day intervals, during which T(b) increases to 37 degrees C for approximately 16 h; thereafter, they return to hibernation and sustain low T(b)s until the next arousal. Over the course of the hibernation season, arousals consume 60-80% of a squirrel's winter energy budget, but their functional significance is unknown and disputed. Host-defense mechanisms appear to be downregulated during the hibernation season and preclude normal immune responses. These experiments assessed immune function during hibernation and subsequent periodic arousals. The acute-phase response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was arrested during hibernation and fully restored on arousal to normothermia. LPS injection (ip) resulted in a 1-1.5 degrees C fever in normothermic animals that was sustained for > 8 h. LPS was without effect in hibernating squirrels, neither inducing fever nor provoking arousal, but a fever did develop several days later, when squirrels next aroused from hibernation; the duration of this arousal was increased sixfold above baseline values. Intracerebroventricular infusions of prostaglandin E(2) provoked arousal from hibernation and induced fever, suggesting that neural signaling pathways that mediate febrile responses are functional during hibernation. Periodic arousals may activate a dormant immune system, which can then combat pathogens that may have been introduced immediately before or during hibernation.",

Humans are suitable accidental hosts for some pentastomid species (particularly Armillifer and Porocephalus). In geographical areas with special ethnics, such as in West and Central Africa, and East Asia, 8-45% of the human population can be affected. Usually the larvae are coincidentally found during abdominal surgeries. However, fatalities have been described. Extreme caution is necessary when handling infected reptiles. Ocular or cerebral sparganosis is not uncommonly found in humans in East Asia. This disease is caused by spargana, tapeworm larvae (plerocercoids) of Spirometra sp. The infection occurs when uncooked meat from reptiles or amphibians is applied to wounds or eyes and the parasites migrate directly to human tissue, or by consumption of contaminated food or water. As a consequence of the reptile's predatory behaviour, the full spectrum of endo- and ectoparasites from potential prey animals can be found as transiting parasites in the intestinal tract, e. g. Hymenolepis nana, Cryptosporidium (C.) muris, C parvum or Capillaria hepatica. Occasionally, free-living amoebae are also found in reptile faeces (Acanthamoeba, Naegleria, Hartmanella, Vahlkampfia or Echinamoeba sp.).",

            "abstractNote": "PDZ and LIM domains-containing proteins play pivotal functions in cell cytoskeleton organization, cell polarization and differentiation. As a key member of the family, PDLIM2 regulates stability and activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB, STATs and β-catenin, and thus exert it functions in inflammation, immunity, and cancer. PDLIM2 functions as a tumor suppressor in multiple tissues and it is often genetically mutated or epigenetically silenced in human cancers derived from lung, breast, ovarian and other histologies. However, in certain types of cancers, PDLIM2 may promote cancer cell proliferation and metastases. Therefore, PDLIM2 is added to a long list of genes that can function as tumor suppressor or oncogenic protein. During tumorigenesis induced by oncogenic viruses, PDLIM2 is a key target. Through promotion of NF-κB/RelA and STAT3 degradation, PDLIM2 enhances expression of proteins involved in antigen presentation and promotes T-cell activation while repressing multidrug resistance genes, thereby rendering mutated cells susceptible to immune surveillance and cytotoxicity mediated by immune cells and chemotherapeutic drugs. Intriguingly, PDLIM2 in alveolar macrophages (AMs) plays key roles in monitoring lung tumorigenesis, as its selective genetic deletion leads to constitutive activation of STAT3, driving monocyte differentiation to AMs with pro-tumorigenic polarization and activation. PDLIM2 has also been explored as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy. At the end of this review, we provide perspectives on this important molecule and discuss the future directions of both basic and translational studies.",

The taxonomy of all the eight extant pangolin species based on molecular genetics studies, remains unresolved and poorly examined. The present study is to address this lacuna by studying the phylogenetic, taxonomic status and molecular dating of Indian pangolin with other six out of eight extant pangolins (Sunda pangolin possibly extinct) based on complete coding region of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Overall sequences divergence among pangolins ranged between 0.01 ± 0.01 and 0.26 ± 0.03, where within 'Manis' it ranged between 0.01 ± 0.01 and 0.14 ± 0.03. Cytochrome b sequences based phylogenetic tree revealed, the division of seven pangolin species into two paraphyletic clades of African and Asian species, further these two paraphyletic clades were divided into three well-supported monophyletic clades, first for the genus 'Smutsia' with two African ground pangolins, second for the genus 'Phataginus' with two African arboreal pangolins and third for 'Manis' with three Asian species. Within clade of 'Manis', Chinese pangolin and Malayan pangolin are basal where Indian pangolin is present as a sister clade and furthermore, molecular dating analysis suggested that pangolins diverged from Carnivora at ∼87.2 MYA, followed by the split of Asian pangolins and African pangolins at ∼36.1 MYA and Indian pangolin split from Chinese pangolin and Malayan pangolin at ∼16.7 MYA.",

BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of vaccines to prevent Ebola virus disease (EVD) were unknown when the incidence of EVD was peaking in Liberia. METHODS: We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of the chimpanzee adenovirus 3 vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) and the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine (rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP) in Liberia. A phase 2 subtrial was embedded to evaluate safety and immunogenicity. Because the incidence of EVD declined in Liberia, the phase 2 component was expanded and the phase 3 component was eliminated. RESULTS: A total of 1500 adults underwent randomization and were followed for 12 months. The median age of the participants was 30 years; 36.6% of the participants were women. During the week after the administration of vaccine or placebo, adverse events occurred significantly more often with the active vaccines than with placebo; these events included injection-site reactions (in 28.5% of the patients in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and 30.9% of those in the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP group, as compared with 6.8% of those in the placebo group), headache (in 25.1% and 31.9%, vs. 16.9%), muscle pain (in 22.3% and 26.9%, vs. 13.3%), feverishness (in 23.9% and 30.5%, vs. 9.0%), and fatigue (in 14.0% and 15.4%, vs. 8.8%) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons); these differences were not seen at 1 month. Serious adverse events within 12 months after injection were seen in 40 participants (8.0%) in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group, in 47 (9.4%) in the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP group, and in 59 (11.8%) in the placebo group. By 1 month, an antibody response developed in 70.8% of the participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and in 83.7% of those in the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP group, as compared with 2.8% of those in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). At 12 months, antibody responses in participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group (63.5%) and in those in the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP group (79.5%) remained significantly greater than in those in the placebo group (6.8%, P < 0.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: A randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of two vaccines that was rapidly initiated and completed in Liberia showed the capability of conducting rigorous research during an outbreak. By 1 month after vaccination, the vaccines had elicited immune responses that were largely maintained through 12 months.",

            "abstractNote": "The investigational vaccine, NDV-3, contains the N-terminal portion of the Candida albicans agglutinin-like sequence 3 protein (Als3p) formulated with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in phosphate-buffered saline. Preclinical studies demonstrated that the Als3p vaccine antigen protects mice from oropharyngeal, vaginal and intravenous challenge with C. albicans and other selected species of Candida as well as both intravenous challenge and skin and soft tissue infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The objectives of this first-in-human Phase I clinical trial were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of NDV-3 at two different antigen levels compared to a saline placebo. Forty healthy, adult subjects were randomized to receive one dose of NDV-3 containing either 30 or 300 ??g of Als3p, or placebo. NDV-3 at both dose levels was safe and generally well-tolerated. Anti-Als3p total IgG and IgA1 levels for both doses reached peak levels by day 14 post vaccination, with 100% seroconversion of all vaccinated subjects. On average, NDV-3 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) production of both IFN-?? and IL-17A, which peaked at day 7 for subjects receiving the 300 ??g dose and at day 28 for those receiving the 30 ??g dose. Six months after receiving the first dose of NDV-3, nineteen subjects received a second dose of NDV-3 identical to their first dose to evaluate memory B- and T-cell immune responses. The second dose resulted in a significant boost of IgG and IgA1 titers in >70% of subjects, with the biggest impact in those receiving the 30 ??g dose. A memory T-cell response was also noted for IFN-?? in almost all subjects and for IL-17A in the majority of subjects. These data support the continued investigation of NDV-3 as a vaccine candidate against Candida and S. aureus infections. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

For a complete understanding, we must also take into account the need of group members to coordinate many other activities, such as travel patterns, feeding schedules, and selection of sleeping sites. Individual activity patterns, the manner in which individuals respond to social and nonsocial events, and use of the spatial environment must also be considered. Here, we will illustrate some of the proximate mechanisms contributing to the monogamous and territorial social system of the titi monkey. We will then present a model showing how many relatively simple, error-prone mechanisms can collectively yield Stereotypic expressions at the group level.",

We examined the Ras-inhibitory effect on functional determinants of Treg in vivo and in vitro. Ras was inhibited in Jurkat T cells by transfection with a dominant-negative form of Ras, or by shRNA for N-Ras, K-Ras, and H-Ras, or by farnesylthiosalycylic acid, a small-molecule inhibitor. Except for H-Ras transduction with shRNA, each inhibitory mode increased expression of Foxp3 and nuclear factor of activated T cell proteins, and surface expression of CD25. Ras inhibition in PBMC and spleen-derived lymphocytes reproduced these findings. The heightened Foxp3 expression reflected both increased basal cellular protein and peripheral conversion of non-Treg to Treg. Ras inhibition enhanced Treg-induced suppression; thus, when adoptively transferred to mice, Ras-inhibited Treg reduced the incidence of diabetes. Inhibition of Foxp3 by respective siRNA reversed the enhancement. Thus, inhibition of the N- or K-Ras isoform triggers an anti-inflammatory effect by up-regulating, via Foxp3 elevation, the numbers and functional suppressive properties of Treg.",

They can cause severe illness, resulting from the formation of granulomas, caseous lesions and abscesses in the intestinal wall. Human oesophagostomosis is endemic in northern Ghana and Togo. In these regions, epidemiological investigations have been conducted to determine the biological characteristics, transmission dynamics and optimal management of clinical cases. Nodular oesophagostomosis has also been described in free-ranging chimpanzees and gorillas. Clinical signs associated with nodules have been observed in great apes raised in sanctuaries, while the health status of their wild counterparts does not seem to be significantly affected It has been suggested that some nonhuman primates may act as reservoirs for human oesophagostomosis. In Ghana, identification of genetic differences among Oesophagostomum nematodes infecting different primate hosts suggests that oesophagostomosis is a rare zoonosis. In Uganda, where the situation is diferent, cross-infection is probably more frequent.",

            "abstractNote": "Fc receptors are important effector molecules of neutrophilic granulocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMN]), connecting phagocytic cells and the specific immune response. Neutrophils from healthy donors express the low-affinity receptors for IgG Fc gamma RII (CD32) and Fc gamma RIII (CD16), but not the high-affinity receptor Fc gamma RI (CD64). The latter has been found on neutrophils from patients with certain bacterial infections and can be induced in vitro after incubation with interferon-gamma. We show here that neutrophils strongly express Fc gamma RI after in vivo application of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). PMN from patients receiving rhG-CSF displayed higher cytotoxicity against Daudi lymphoma cells in vitro compared with control patients and with healthy donors. Fab fragments against Fc gamma RII (monoclonal antibody [MoAb] IV.3) inhibited neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity of healthy donors but not of patients during rhG-CSF therapy. Therefore, expression of Fc receptors by PMN was investigated by flow cytometry and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was compared. After staining with MoAb 32.2 against Fc gamma RL, the median MFI of neutrophils from G-CSF patients (median, 4.78; range, 2.40 to 8.50; n = 5) was significantly higher (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively) than the median MFI of patients not receiving G-CSF (median, 1.23; range, 1.01 to 1.58; n = 6) and the median MFI of healthy donors (median, 1.04; range, 0.67 to 1.12; n = 6). Fc gamma RI disappeared after the discontinuing of the G-CSF injections, but was reinduced during the next treatment cycle with rhG-CSF. The high expression of Fc gamma RI during rhG-CSF therapy correlated with enhanced cytotoxicity. In vitro incubation with rhG-CSF also enhances cytotoxicity, but only minor increments in Fc gamma RI expression were observed. Thus, during in vivo application of rhG-CSF neutrophils acquire an additional potent receptor for mediating tumor cell killing in vitro by induction of the high-affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI, CD64).",

            "abstractNote": "Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.",

            "abstractNote": "Transition metals occupy an essential niche in biological systems. Their electrostatic properties stabilize substrates or reaction intermediates in the active sites of enzymes, and their heightened reactivity is harnessed for catalysis. However, this heightened activity also renders transition metals toxic at high concentrations. Bacteria, like all living organisms, must regulate their intracellular levels of these elements to satisfy their physiological needs while avoiding harm. It is therefore not surprising that the host capitalizes on both the essentiality and toxicity of transition metals to defend against bacterial invaders. This Review discusses established and emerging paradigms in nutrient metal homeostasis at the pathogen-host interface.",

            "abstractNote": "IL-17C is a functionally distinct member of the IL-17 family that binds IL-17 receptor E/A to promote innate defense in epithelial cells and regulate Th17 cell differentiation. We demonstrate that IL-17C (not IL-17A) is the most abundant IL-17 isoform in lesional psoriasis skin (1058 versus 8 pg/ml; p < 0.006) and localizes to keratinocytes (KCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and leukocytes. ECs stimulated with IL-17C produce increased TNF-α and KCs stimulated with IL-17C/TNF-α produce similar inflammatory gene response patterns as those elicited by IL-17A/TNF-α, including increases in IL-17C, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1α/β, IL-1F5, IL-1F9, IL-6, IL-19, CCL20, S100A7/A8/A9, DEFB4, lipocalin 2, and peptidase inhibitor 3 (p < 0.05), indicating a positive proinflammatory feedback loop between the epidermis and ECs. Psoriasis patients treated with etanercept rapidly decrease cutaneous IL-17C levels, suggesting IL-17C/TNF-α-mediated inflammatory signaling is critical for psoriasis pathogenesis. Mice genetically engineered to overexpress IL-17C in KCs develop well-demarcated areas of erythematous, flakey involved skin adjacent to areas of normal-appearing uninvolved skin despite increased IL-17C expression in both areas (p < 0.05). Uninvolved skin displays increased angiogenesis and elevated S100A8/A9 expression (p < 0.05) but no epidermal hyperplasia, whereas involved skin exhibits robust epidermal hyperplasia, increased angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltration, and upregulated TNF-α, IL-1α/β, IL-17A/F, IL-23p19, vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-6, and CCL20 (p < 0.05), suggesting that IL-17C, when coupled with other proinflammatory signals, initiates the development of psoriasiform dermatitis. This skin phenotype was significantly improved following 8 wk of TNF-α inhibition. These findings identify a role for IL-17C in skin inflammation and suggest a pathogenic function for the elevated IL-17C observed in lesional psoriasis skin.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: RNA-seq is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying transcription and splicing events, both known and novel. However, given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods, understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value.\\n\\nRESULTS: We present a method, in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq), for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of over 1,000 in vitro transcribed RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with polyA and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length, and we show in vitro transcription is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However, with common RNA-seq applications and platforms, we find 50% of transcripts have more than two-fold and 10% have more than 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. We also find greater than 6% of transcripts have regions of dramatically unpredictable sequencing coverage between samples, confounding accurate determination of their expression. We use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage, and several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results show the utility of IVT-seq for promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq. We find rRNA depletion is responsible for substantial, unappreciated biases in coverage introduced during library preparation. These biases suggest exon-level expression analysis may be inadvisable, and we recommend caution when interpreting RNA-seq results.",

            "abstractNote": "Intravenous administration of endotoxin into humans causes transient fever, alteration in the number of circulating neutrophils, and transient release into plasma of cytokines, cytokine antagonists, and other cellular products. The release can be temporally differentiated, and the extent of release is dose-dependent. By 1 h after endotoxin challenge, levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and soluble TNF receptor increase; interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 increase by 1.5 h, and IL-1 receptor antagonist, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and lactoferrin increase by 2 h. Increased G-CSF is temporally associated with neutrophilia and the appearance of band neutrophils. Increased plasma lactoferrin and altered neutrophil surface antigen expression suggest that intravascular activation of neutrophils has occurred. The level of soluble E-selectin (sE-sel), an adhesion molecule released from endothelial cells, is elevated at 4 h and remains elevated at 24 h. sE-sel levels increase with higher doses of endotoxin at 4, 6, and 24 h.",

            "abstractNote": "Despite advances in immunosuppressive regimens, acute graft-versus-host disease remains a frequent complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Pathogenic donor T cells are dependent on correct attachment of small GTPases to the cell membrane, mediated by farnesyl- or geranylgeranyl residues, which, therefore, constitute potential targets for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. A mouse model was used to study the impact of a farnesyl-transferase inhibitor and a geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitor on acute graft-versus-host disease, anti-cytomegalovirus T-cell responses and graft-versus-leukemia activity. Treatment of mice undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with farnesyl-transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitor reduced the histological severity of graft-versus-host disease and prolonged survival significantly. Mechanistically, farnesyl-transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitor treatment resulted in reduced alloantigen-driven expansion of CD4 T cells. In vivo treatment led to increased thymic cellularity and polyclonality of the T-cell receptor repertoire by reducing thymic graft-versus-host disease. These effects were absent when squalene production was blocked. The farnesyl-transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitor did not compromise CD8 function against leukemia cells or reconstitution of T cells that were subsequently responsible for anti-murine cytomegalovirus responses. In summary, we observed an immunomodulatory effect of inhibitors of farnesyl-transferase and geranylgeranyl-transferase on graft-versus-host disease, with enhanced functional immune reconstitution. In the light of the modest toxicity of farnesyl-transferase inhibitors such as tipifarnib in patients and the potent reduction of graft-versus-host disease in mice, farnesyl-transferase and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitors could help to reduce graft-versus-host disease significantly without having a negative impact on immune reconstitution.",

            "abstractNote": "Farnesylation of p21(ras) is an important step in the intracellular signaling pathway of growth factors, hormones, and immune stimulants. We synthesized a potent and selective farnesyltransferase inhibitor (LB42708) with IC(50) values of 0.8 nM in vitro and 8 nM in cultured cells against p21(ras) farnesylation and examined the effects of this inhibitor in the settings of inflammation and arthritis. LB42708 suppressed NF-kappaB activation and iNOS promoter activity by suppressing the I-kappaB kinase activity and I-kappaBalpha degradation. The inhibitor suppressed the expression of inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta and the production of NO and PGE(2) in immune-activated macrophages and osteoblasts as well as LPS-administrated mice. Furthermore, in vivo administration of LB42708 significantly decreased the incidence and severity of arthritis as well as mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in the paws of collagen-induced arthritic mice compared with controls. These observations indicate that the anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic effects of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor may be ascribed to the inhibition of I-kappaB kinase activity and subsequent suppression of NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory gene expression through the suppression of p21(ras) farnesylation. Together, these findings reveal that the inhibitory effect of LB42708 on p21(ras)-dependent NF-kappaB activation may have potential therapeutic value for arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.",

            "abstractNote": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β can act in the brain (centrally) to cause fever. Sickness behaviors which accompany fever also appear to involve the central action of IL-1β. We injected species-homologous rat IL-6 and IL-1β directly into the brains of conscious rats to examine the effect of these cytokines on fever, and two behaviors affected by sickness, voluntary wheel-running and food intake. Male Sprague-Dawley rats selected for their predisposition to spontaneously run on running wheels were used in the experiment. Each rat was anaesthetized and had a temperature-sensitive radiotransmitter implanted intra-abdominally, and a 23-gauge stainless steel guide cannula inserted stereotaxically over the lateral cerebral ventricle. Rats were randomly assigned to receive intracerebroventricular injections of three doses of either IL-1β or IL-6 (100 ng, 1 ng or 0.1 ng IL-1β and 200 ng, 20 ng or 2 ng IL-6), or one of three different combinations of IL-1β and IL-6. Rats receiving either IL-1β or IL-6 showed a dose-dependent increase in body temperature and decrease in wheel-running (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Only rats receiving the highest dose of IL-1β significantly decreased food intake and body mass compared to rats receiving vehicle (ANOVA, p < 0.001). Doses of IL-1β and IL-6 which, when injected on their own were non-pyrogenic and did not affect food intake and body mass, induced fever and anorexia when they were co-injected centrally. These results show that species-homologous rat IL-6 and IL-1β can act directly within the brain to decrease voluntary activity and suggest they also can act synergistically to induce anorexia and fever. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

            "abstractNote": "IL-4 and IFN-gamma each have potent effects on B cell responses as well as strong mutual antagonism. Here we have examined the quantitative effects of these cytokines on CD40 ligand-induced B cell proliferation, cell survival, and division-linked isotype switching. Both IL-4 (strongly) and IFN-gamma (weakly) enhanced the number of B cells found in culture by reducing the average time cells take to enter the first division cycle and by promoting B cell survival. When added in combination, the net effect of IL-4 and IFN-gamma on time to division and survival was a response intermediate between that of the two cytokines alone, indicating a partial antagonism of IL-4 by IFN-gamma. By modulating both time to division and cell survival, these small effects of IFN-gamma are amplified and give rise to large reductions in cell number in the presence of IL-4. At higher concentrations, IFN-gamma had minor inhibitory effects on IL-4-induced isotype switching to IgG1 and greater effects on IgE. A reciprocal relation was observed between the ability to inhibit IgE at late cell divisions vs induction of IgG2a. In contrast, IL-4 did not prevent switching to IgG2a induced by IFN-gamma alone. Therefore, antagonism between IFN-gamma and IL-4 is observed at multiple levels and over different concentration ranges, resulting in complex net outcomes. The evolutionary significance of this complexity is discussed.",

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and intensity of intestinal parasites in a single group of mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda over 7 weeks from June to August 2000. Fecal samples were collected from night nests and transported in formalin for examination at Cornell University and the Centers for Disease Control. All fecal samples were examined microscopically for parasitic larvae, cysts, and eggs. The following were found: strongylid eggs, Probstymaria sp. larvae, and two parasitic nematode larvae that were not identified. Additional examination techniques will be used to further examine the fecal material specifically for protozoan cysts. An increasing threat to this group of gorillas is the presence of local field assistants and researchers. We found no evidence of human parasites in the fecal samples from this gorilla group.",

Recently discovered related molecules are forming a family of cytokines, the IL-17 family. The prototype member of the family has been designated IL-17A. Due to recent advances in the human genome sequencing and proteomics five additional members have been identified and cloned: IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E and IL-17F. The cognate receptors for the IL-17 family identified thus far are: IL-17R, IL-17RH1, IL-17RL (receptor like), IL-17RD and IL-17RE. However, the ligand specificities of many of these receptors have not been established. The IL-17 signaling system is operative in disparate tissues such as articular cartilage, bone, meniscus, brain, hematopoietic tissue, kidney, lung, skin and intestine. Thus, the evolving IL-17 family of ligands and receptors may play an important role in the homeostasis of tissues in health and disease beyond the immune system. This survey reviews the biological actions of IL-17 signaling in cancers, musculoskeletal tissues, the immune system and other tissues. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "Due to their structural similarity, interleukin (IL)-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24 and IL-26 were combined with IL-10 in the so-called IL-10 family. To expand the knowledge on IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24, we systematically and quantitatively analysed the expression of these mediators and their receptor chains in vitro and in vivo under various conditions and in comparison with other IL-10 family members. In vitro, IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 were produced not only by activated immune cells, particularly monocytes, but also to a similar extent by keratinocytes. IL-1beta increased the expression of these mediators 1000-fold (IL-19) and 10-fold (IL-20 and IL-24) in keratinocytes. In vivo, these cytokines were expressed preferentially in inflamed tissues. The absence of either R1 chain for the two types of receptor complexes for these cytokines (IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R1/IL-20R2) on immune cells implies that they cannot act on these cells. In fact, IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 did not induce activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules in immune cells. Instead, several tissues, particularly the skin, tissues from the reproductive and respiratory systems, and various glands appeared to be the main targets of these mediators. Keratinocytes expressed both receptor complexes; however, the expression of IL-22R1 was 10 times higher than that of IL-20R1. Interferon-gamma further increased the expression of IL-22R1 and decreased that of IL-20R1, suggesting that under T1 cytokine conditions these mediators primarily affect keratinocytes via the IL-22R1/IL-20R2 complex. In summary, these data support the notion that IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 are distinct from classical ILs and constitute a separate subfamily of mediators within the IL-10 family.",

            "abstractNote": "Ligation of T cell receptor (TCR) alone is insufficient to induce full activation of T lymphocytes. Additional ligand-receptor interactions (costimulation) on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T cells are required. T cell costimulation has been shown to be essential for eliciting efficient T cell responses, involving all phases during T cell development. However, the mechanisms by which costimulation affects the function of T cells still need to be elucidated. In recent years, advances have been made in studies of costimulation as potential therapies in cancer, infectious disease as well as autoimmune disease. In this review, we discussed intracellular costimulation signals that regulate T cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cytokine production, survival, and memory development. In general, the pathway of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt)/nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) might be central to many costimulatory effects. Through these pathways, costimulation controls T-cell expansion and proliferation by maintenance of survivin and aurora B expression, and sustains long-term T-cell survival and memory development by regulating the expression of bcl-2 family members.",

Most samples (69%) were positive but the prevalence of intestinal parasites in the 61 gorilla samples (84%) was higher than in the 66 chimpanzee samples (56%). At least 11 species of parasite were observed: six protozoan, one trematode and at least four nematodes. Six of the species were found in gorillas and chimpanzees but the remainder only occurred in chimpanzees. All but one parasite occurred at low prevalences. Entodiniomorph ciliates, which occurred frequently in both ape species (particularly in gorillas) in the Lope survey and in all previous coprological surveys of wild apes, may be symbionts involved in cellulose digestion. The dietary and behavioural strategies of wild primates that serve to reduce infection by pathogenic parasites are reviewed.",

            "abstractNote": "Reptiles tend to have a broad innate immune response followed by a more moderate adaptive response, and as an ectotherm, their immune response is strongly affected by temperature. The innate immune responses in reptiles encompass a diverse group of molecules and cells that includes non-specific leukocytes, lysozymes, antimicrobial peptides, the complement pathway and fever. The adaptive response involves both T and B cells; however, reptile humoral responses are much less robust than mammalian responses. Thus, reptiles may rely more heavily on a natural antibody response. The slower adaptive response may be because reptiles lack lymph nodes and do not form germinal centres. Phagocytic B cells have also been identified in reptiles. Studies of the reptilian immune system may contribute to our understanding of the evolution of the immune system as well as to the fields of conservation biology, ecological immunology and human medicine.",

Once the infection spills over into a wild animal species with maintenance host potential, conventional measures are no longer sufficient to provide effective control. In South Africa, African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) represent the most important maintenance host for M. bovis. Apart from transmitting the disease to predators and scavengers that feed on them, buffalo also serve as a source of infection to other wildlife species through environmental contamination. In several countries, it was shown that an infected wildlife reservoir that interacts with livestock causes frequent herd breakdowns and substantial economic losses to the agricultural sector. The outbreak of tuberculosis in free-ranging wildlife populations thus poses a huge challenge on long-term management and control strategies to prevent spillover into other wildlife, especially endangered, wildlife species and domestic livestock.",

The objectives of the study were to collect baseline data in order to document the helminth parasites infecting this group of gorillas and to examine the effects of season and host age-sex class on patterns of parasite infection. In addition to weekly surveys of feces from all group members, fecal samples from 4 identified individuals were examined almost daily. We identified the diagnostic stages of the following parasites: strongylids (Strongylida), Anoplocephala gorillae, Probstmayria sp., Strongyloides fuelleborni, and a trematode. Monthly and daily fluctuations in strongylid egg counts were observed. Infants had lower strongylid egg counts compared with other group members. Both of the silverbacks had higher mean egg counts in the wet season than in the dry season. Examination of fecal samples from identifiable gorillas revealed high day-to-day variation in strongylid egg counts. No evidence of anthropozoonotic transmission of intestinal helminths was found.",

            "abstractNote": "Zoonotic monkeypox virus is maintained in a large number of rodent and, to a lesser extent, nonhuman primate species in West and central Africa. Although monkeypox virus was discovered in 1958, the prototypic human cases were not witnessed until the early 1970s. Before this time, it is assumed that infections were masked by smallpox, which was then widely endemic. Nevertheless, since the 1970s, reported monkeypox virus infections of humans have escalated, as have outbreaks with reported human-to-human transmission. This increase is likely due to numerous factors, such as enhanced surveillance efforts, environmental degradation and human urbanization of areas where monkeypox virus is maintained in its animal reservoir(s) and, consequently, serve as a nidus for human infection. Furthermore, viral genetic predispositions enable monkeypox virus to infect many animal species, represented in expansive geographic ranges. Monkeypox virus was once restricted to specific regions of Africa, but its environ has expanded, in one case intercontinentally--suggesting that human monkeypox infections could continue to intensify. As a zoonotic agent, monkeypox virus is far less sensitive to typical eradication measures since it is maintained in wild-animal populations. Moreover, human vaccination is becoming a less viable option to control poxvirus infections in today's increasingly immunocompromised population, particularly with the emergence of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. An increased frequency of human monkeypox virus infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals, may permit monkeypox virus to evolve and maintain itself independently in human populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Effective immune responses against pathogens are sometimes accompanied by strong inflammatory reactions. To minimize damage to self, the activation of the immune system also triggers anti-inflammatory circuits. Both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions are normal components of the same immune response, which coordinately fight infections while preventing immune pathology. IL-10 is an important suppressive cytokine, produced by a large number of immune cells in addition to the antigen-driven IL-10-producing regulatory and the naturally occurring suppressor CD4+ T cells, which is a key player in anti-inflammatory immune responses. However, additional mechanisms have evolved to ensure that pathogen eradication is achieved with minimum damage to the host. Here we discuss those mechanisms that operate to regulate effector immune responses.",

            "abstractNote": "We report here that FcR for human monomeric IgG1 can be induced on cells of myeloid origin cultured in the presence of IFN gamma for 8 h. Supernatant fluids from cultures of lymphocytes infected with a variety of viruses or cocultured with cell lines have the same FcR enhancing effect as IFN gamma. We identify the factor in the supernatant fluid responsible for the induction as immune interferon. Among the different types of IFN, only the gamma type (both purified and recombinant) specifically induces the appearance of FcR for monomeric IgG1 on normal and leukemic myeloid cells but not on cells of lymphoid origin. This effect is also evident on mature PMN. We show that the specificity and the affinity of the receptor induced on HL-60 promyelocytic cells, peripheral blood monocytes, and PMN are identical to those of the receptor spontaneously present on the same cells, except for PMN, which do not spontaneously express this type of receptor. The results of inhibition experiments performed with mouse IgG of and IgG3. These results suggest that the receptor present on human monocytes different isotypes indicate that the receptor can be inhibited by murine IgG2a or immature myeloid cells, selectively inducible by IFN gamma, has a specificity similar to the FcR1 described on mouse macrophages.",

            "abstractNote": "Interleukin 17C (IL-17C) is a member of the IL-17 family that is selectively induced in epithelia by bacterial challenge and inflammatory stimuli. Here we show that IL-17C functioned in a unique autocrine manner, binding to a receptor complex consisting of the receptors IL-17RA and IL-17RE, which was preferentially expressed on tissue epithelial cells. IL-17C stimulated epithelial inflammatory responses, including the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides, which were similar to those induced by IL-17A and IL-17F. However, IL-17C was produced by distinct cellular sources, such as epithelial cells, in contrast to IL-17A, which was produced mainly by leukocytes, especially those of the T(H)17 subset of helper T cells. Whereas IL-17C promoted inflammation in an imiquimod-induced skin-inflammation model, it exerted protective functions in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Thus, IL-17C is an essential autocrine cytokine that regulates innate epithelial immune responses.",

            "abstractNote": "The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) results from restored immunity to specific infectious or non-infectious antigens. A paradoxical clinical worsening of a known condition or the appearance of a new condition after initiating therapy characterizes the syndrome. Potential mechanisms for the syndrome include a partial recovery of the immune system or exuberant host immunological responses to antigenic stimuli. The overall incidence of IRIS is unknown, but is dependent on the population studied and its underlying opportunistic infectious burden. The infectious pathogens most frequently implicated in the syndrome are mycobacteria, varicella zoster, herpesviruses, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). No single treatment option exists and depends on the underlying infectious agent and its clinical presentation. Prospective cohort studies addressing the optimal screening and treatment of opportunistic infections in patients eligible for ART are currently being conducted. These studies will provide evidence for the development of treatment guidelines in order to reduce the burden of IRIS. We review the available literature on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of IRIS, and present treatment options for the more common infectious manifestations of this diverse syndrome and for manifestations associated with a high morbidity.\nPMID: 17488505",

            "abstractNote": "Summary\nHendra virus, first identified in 1994 in Queensland, is an emerging zoonotic pathogen gaining importance in Australia because a growing number of infections are reported in horses and people. The virus, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae (genus Henipavirus), is transmitted to horses by pteropid bats (fruit bats or flying foxes), with human infection a result of direct contact with infected horses. Case-fatality rate is high in both horses and people, and so far, more than 60 horses and four people have died from Hendra virus infection in Australia. Human infection is characterised by an acute encephalitic syndrome or relapsing encephalitis, for which no effective treatment is currently available. Recent identification of Hendra virus infection in a domestic animal outside the laboratory setting, and the large range of pteropid bats in Australia, underpins the potential of this virus to cause greater morbidity and mortality in both rural and urban populations and its importance to both veterinary and human health. Attempts at treatment with ribavirin and chloroquine have been unsuccessful. Education, hygiene, and infection control measures have hitherto been the mainstay of prevention, while access to monoclonal antibody treatment and development of an animal vaccine offer further opportunities for disease prevention and control.",

Major alterations of ground squirrel hemoglobin occur with the varying activity states as evidenced by the distinctive changes in the isoelectric points (pIs) of these protein components. 3. 3. Hemoglobin from winter-hibernating or summer-induced hibernating ground squirrels does not revert to a fetal type of hemoglobin. 4. 4.

Here we identified 24 hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes with precise origination timing in vertebrate phylogeny. Strand-specific RNA-Seq analyses were performed in five rhesus macaque tissues (liver, prefrontal cortex, skeletal muscle, adipose, and testis), which were then integrated with public transcriptome data from human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque. On the basis of comparing the RNA expression profiles in the three species, we found that most of the hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes encoded polyadenylated non-coding RNAs in rhesus macaque or chimpanzee with a similar transcript structure and correlated tissue expression profile. According to the rule of parsimony, the majority of these hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes appear to have acquired a regulated transcript structure and expression profile before acquiring coding potential. Interestingly, although the expression profile was largely correlated, the coding genes in human often showed higher transcriptional abundance than their non-coding counterparts in rhesus macaque. The major findings we report in this manuscript are robust and insensitive to the parameters used in the identification and analysis of de novo genes. Our results suggest that at least a portion of long non-coding RNAs, especially those with active and regulated transcription, may serve as a birth pool for protein-coding genes, which are then further optimized at the transcriptional level.",

Data were obtained the following spring for five males and three females. During the heterothermal period, all squirrels exhibited 11–22 prolonged (x 5 9.4 d) torpor bouts punctuated by typically brief (x 5 14.3 h) arousal bouts, with mean monthly torpor bouts becoming longer and deeper until Feb. and reversing thereafter. Torpor-bout duration increased as minimum skin and soil temperatures decreased. On average, males initiated the first torpor bout later in fall, terminated the last torpor bout significantly earlier in spring and thus spent less time in the heterothermal period than did females. Three males displayed relatively short torpor bouts and long arousal bouts as they approached the end of hibernation. Squirrels gained weight variably in fall and spring, and one female lost 39 % of body mass during hibernation",

            "abstractNote": "Reptiles rely on thermal heat exchange to achieve body temperatures (Tbody) conducive to maintaining homeostasis. Diurnal changes in the thermal environment are therefore liable to influence allostatic mediation of survival processes (e.g., immunity) during environmental challenges or stressors. However, the extent to which Tbody prompts individual variation in physiology remains largely unexplored in reptiles. Our study tested how circulating energy-mobilizing hormone, energy metabolites, and immunity can vary across basal and stress-induced allostatic states for plateau side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana uniformis) residing in a heterogeneous thermal environment. We collected baseline and acute stress blood samples from male lizards to compare changes in plasma corticosterone (CORT), glucose, and bacterial killing ability (BKA) in relation to each other and Tbody. We hypothesized each physiological parameter differs between allostatic states, whereby stress-induced activity increases from baseline. At basal and stress-induced states, we also hypothesized circulating CORT, glucose, and BKA directly correspond with each other and Tbody. We found both CORT and BKA increased while glucose instead decreased from acute stress. At basal and stress-induced allostatic states, we found CORT to be directly related to Tbody while BKA was inversely related to CORT. We also found BKA and glucose were directly related at baseline, but inversely related following acute stress. Overall, these results demonstrate allostatic outcomes from acute stress in a free-living reptile and the role of temperature in mediating energetic state and immunity. Future research on reptilian allostasis should consider multiple environmental conditions and their implications for physiological performance and survival.",

As D. fragilis has a propensity to cause chronic illness with symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) it is not surprising that some patients with D. fragilis are misdiagnosed as having IBS. In contrast to most other pathogenic protozoa very little is known about its life cycle, epidemiology and mode of transmission. What role animal reservoirs play in the transmission of this parasite is unknown. Consequently we undertook a prospective study to determine the host distribution of D. fragilis. Over a 2-year-period, 608 faecal samples from a wide range of animal and bird species, including pigs and other food species, were screened using permanent stained smears for the presence of D. fragilis. Trophozoites of D. fragilis were only detected in Western lowland gorillas (3/10) (Gorilla g. gorilla) and confirmed by PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene. The limited host range detected suggests human infection may not involve transmission from other animal species. In addition, we provide an update on the limited knowledge about the life cycle of this parasite and its host distribution.",

Three hundred and fifteen faecal samples were subjected to a battery of diagnostic tests, namely, direct smear, modified formal ether sedimentation, Kato thick smear, Harada-Mori techniques for parasite detection and culture to facilitate nematode larvae identification. Of these, 203 (64.4%) harboured helminths and 54 (17.1%) had protozoa. The helminth parasites comprised Strongyloides fulleborni 141 (44.8%), Trichuris trichuira 200 (63.5,%), Oesophagostomum sp. 48 (15.2%), Trichostrongylus sp. 73 (23.2%), Enterobius vermicularis 44 (14.0%), Schistosoma mansoni 4/92 (4.3%) and Streptopharagus sp. 68 (21.6%). Protozoan parasites consisted of Entamoeba coli 204 (64.8%), Balantidium coli 127 (40.3%) and Entamoeba histolytica 78 (24.8%). Both WT and colony-borne (CB) primates had similar species of parasites, but higher prevalences of protozoan infection were observed in CB baboons while helminth infections were relatively more common in WT primates. Some of the parasites observed in this study are reported to be zoonotic in various parasitological literatures. Chemoprophylaxis and other managerial practices were believed to be responsible for the lower worm prevalence in CB primates. Similar intervention against protozoa and other agents will not only improve primate health, but also increase safety to animal handlers and colony workers.",

            "abstractNote": "Emerging infectious diseases are of great concern for both wildlife and humans. Several highly virulent fungal pathogens have recently been discovered in natural populations, highlighting the need for a better understanding of fungal-vertebrate host-pathogen interactions. Because most fungal pathogens are not fatal in the absence of other predisposing conditions, host-pathogen dynamics for deadly fungal pathogens are of particular interest. The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (hereafter Bd) infects hundreds of species of frogs in the wild. It is found worldwide and is a significant contributor to the current global amphibian decline. However, the mechanism by which Bd causes death in amphibians, and the response of the host to Bd infection, remain largely unknown. Here we use whole-genome microarrays to monitor the transcriptional responses to Bd infection in the model frog species, Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis, which is susceptible to chytridiomycosis. To elucidate the immune response to Bd and evaluate the physiological effects of chytridiomycosis, we measured gene expression changes in several tissues (liver, skin, spleen) following exposure to Bd. We detected a strong transcriptional response for genes involved in physiological processes that can help explain some clinical symptoms of chytridiomycosis at the organismal level. However, we detected surprisingly little evidence of an immune response to Bd exposure, suggesting that this susceptible species may not be mounting efficient innate and adaptive immune responses against Bd. The weak immune response may be partially explained by the thermal conditions of the experiment, which were optimal for Bd growth. However, many immune genes exhibited decreased expression in Bd-exposed frogs compared to control frogs, suggesting a more complex effect of Bd on the immune system than simple temperature-mediated immune suppression. This study generates important baseline data for ongoing efforts to understand differences in response to Bd between susceptible and resistant frog species and the effects of chytridiomycosis in natural populations.",

First, long-term association with pathogens results in genomic signatures that result from positive selection. Evolutionary pressures tailor species or individual responses to pathogens, that may be associated with skewed patterns of immunity. Second, recent human population expansion carries an increasing burden of genetic mutation that can result in sporadic immunodeficiencies, and more generally, in diversity in susceptibility to infection. This review highlights current concepts and tools for the analysis of genomes and stresses the interest of these approaches in immunity. ?? 2014.",

            "abstractNote": "RNAlater is a commonly used transport and storage solution for samples collected for fish health investigations, particularly those potentially involving viruses. However, the infectivity of fish viruses after storage in RNAlater have not been determined. Nevertheless, knowledge of pathogen infectivity of preserved samples is crucial for ensuring safe transport and storage protocols. Therefore, the infectivity of three fish RNA viruses in RNAlater was examined at four temperatures: -80 °C, 4 °C, room temperature (RT, approximately 22 °C) and 37 °C. The viruses were viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and chum salmon reovirus (CSV). Overall, three consistent outcomes were observed. First, all three viruses remained infectious in RNAlater at RT or lower. High log titres of these viruses remained over 30 d of storage in either RNAlater or PBS. Second, RNAlater delayed the thermal inactivation of these viruses when compared to PBS at 37 °C. For VHSV, the titre remained high in RNAlater after one day of incubation at 37 °C, but was inactivated to below threshold in PBS over the same period. For IPNV, the titre remained high in RNAlater after 30 d of incubation at 37 °C, but was inactivated to below threshold in PBS over the same period. For CSV, the titre was slightly higher in RNAlater than PBS at 37 °C over 7 d, and by day 30, only samples stored in RNAlater proved infectious at titres above the detection threshold. Third, RNAlater delayed the inactivation of these viruses when they were stored together with head kidney homogenates. For VHSV, infectious virus was recovered from samples stored at 4 °C in RNAlater by day 7 of incubation, whereas it was inactivated to below threshold in PBS over the same period. For both IPNV and CSV, infectious virus was recovered from samples stored at 37 °C in RNAlater for 7 d, but not so in PBS. In summary, fish viruses can remain infectious and are even temporarily protected from inactivation while in RNAlater. This makes RNAlater a potentially useful solution for the transport of fish viruses. At the same time, precautionary measures must be taken when transporting potentially infectious samples in RNAlater.",

            "abstractNote": "1. Ecoimmunologists aim to understand the costs, benefits, and net fitness consequences of different strategies for immune defense. 2. Measuring the fitness consequences of immune responses is difficult, partly because of complex relationships between host fitness and the within-host density of parasites and immunological cells or molecules. In particular, neither the strongest immune responses nor the lowest parasite densities necessarily maximize host fitness. 3. Here, we propose that ecoimmunologists should routinely endeavour to measure three intertwined parameters: host fitness, parasite density, and relevant immune responses. We further propose that analyses of relationships among these traits would benefit from the statistical machinery used for analyses of phenotypic plasticity and/or methods that are robust to the bi-directional causation inherent in host-parasite relationships. For example, analyses of how host fitness depends upon parasite density, which is an evolutionary ecological definition of tolerance, would benefit from these more robust methods. 4. Together, these steps promote rigorous quantification of the fitness consequences of immune responses. Such quantification is essential if ecoimmunologists are to decipher causes of immune polymorphism in nature and predict trajectories of natural selection on immune defense.",

            "abstractNote": "Selection against migrants is key to maintaining genetic differences between popu- lations linked by dispersal. However, migrants may mitigate fitness costs by proac- tively choosing among available habitats, or by phenotypic plasticity. We previously reported that a reciprocal transplant of lake and stream stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) found little support for divergent selection. Here, we revi- sit that experiment to test whether phenotypic plasticity in gene expression may have helped migrants adjust to unfamiliar habitats. We measured gene expression profiles in stickleback via TagSeq and tested whether migrants between lake and stream habitats exhibited a plastic response to their new environment that allowed them to converge on the expression profile of adapted natives. We report exten- sive gene expression differences between genetically divergent lake and stream stickleback, despite gene flow. But for many genes, expression was highly plastic. Fish transplanted into the adjoining habitat partially converged on the expression profile typical of natives from their new habitat. This suggests that expression plasticity may soften the impact of migration. Nonetheless, lake and stream fish differed in survival rates and parasite infection rates in our study, implying that expression plasticity is not fast or extensive enough to fully homogenize fish performance.",

            "abstractNote": "One of the major factors threatening chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Guinea-Bissau is habitat fragmentation. Such fragmentation may cause changes in symbiont dynamics resulting in increased susceptibility to infection, changes in host specificity and virulence. We monitored gastrointestinal symbiotic fauna of three chimpanzee subpopulations living within Cantanhez National Park (CNP) in Guinea Bissau in the areas with different levels of anthropogenic fragmentation. Using standard coproscopical methods (merthiolate-iodine formalin concentration and Sheather's flotation) we examined 102 fecal samples and identified at least 13 different symbiotic genera (Troglodytella abrassarti, Troglocorys cava, Blastocystis spp., Entamoeba spp., Iodamoeba butschlii, Giardia intestinalis, Chilomastix mesnili, Bertiella sp., Probstmayria gombensis, unidentified strongylids, Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyloides fuelleborni, and Trichuris sp.). The symbiotic fauna of the CNP chimpanzees is comparable to that reported for other wild chimpanzee populations, although CNP chimpanzees have a higher prevalence of Trichuris sp. Symbiont richness was higher in chimpanzee subpopulations living in fragmented forests compared to the community inhabiting continuous forest area. We reported significantly higher prevalence of G. intestinalis in chimpanzees from fragmented areas, which could be attributed to increased contact with humans and livestock.",
