Understanding how stakeholders perceive risks is fundamental to successful disease management, yet a clear systematic theory-based framework is lacking. We expanded and tested a portion of the zoonotic disease risk information seeking and processing (ZDRISP) framework using a tailored design method survey with a sample (n= 4,000) of Michigan deer hunters. Our study revealed respondents perceived risks from wildlife disease management policies, which are inﬂuenced by disease risk perceptions and subjective and descriptive norms. These results advance a zoonotic disease risk perception theoretical framework that can be applied to understand stakeholder perceptions of different wildlife diseases having varying levels of prevalence, susceptibility, or severity. Integrating insights about human perceptions of the disease and its management policies will enhance likelihood of success of wildlife disease management.",

I place the exposome in a historical perspective, by analyzing the conditions under which the exposome has been conceived, developed and established in the context of contemporary epidemiological research. I argue that the exposome has been developed by transferring approaches, methods and conceptualizations from other lines of research in the life and health sciences. I thus discuss the conceptual and methodological innovations of the exposome as a result of the merging and adaptation of these elements for new uses and purposes. On this basis, I argue that the novelty of the exposome should be seen in incremental rather than revolutionary terms and, in this sense, the exposome shares signiﬁcant elements with other projects and repertoires in postgenomics. I conclude by discussing the consequences of this analysis for the potential limitations and future development of exposome research.",

            "abstractNote": "Over time the human–animal bond has been changed. For instance, the role of pets has changed from work animals (protecting houses, catching mice) to animals with a social function, giving companionship. Pets can be important for the physical and mental health of their owners but may also transmit zoonotic infections. The One Health initiative is a worldwide strategy for expanding collaborations in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment. However, in One Health communications the role of particularly dogs and cats is often underestimated. Objective: Evaluation of positive and negative One Health issues of the human–companion animal relationship with a focus on zoonotic aspects of cats and dogs in industrialized countries. Method: Literature review. Results: Pets undoubtedly have a positive eﬀect on human health, while owners are increasing aware of pet’s health and welfare. The changing attitude of humans with regard to pets and their environment can also lead to negative eﬀects such as changes in feeding practices, extreme breeding, and behavioral problems, and anthropozoonoses. For the human, there may be a higher risk of the transmission of zoonotic infections due to trends such as sleeping with pets, allowing pets to lick the face or wounds, bite accidents, keeping exotic animals, the importation of rescue dogs, and soil contact. Conclusions: One Health issues need frequently re-evaluated as the close human–animal relationship with pet animals can totally diﬀer compared to decennia ago. Because of the changed human–companion animal bond, recommendations regarding responsible pet-ownership, including normal hygienic practices, responsible breeding, feeding, housing, and mental and physical challenges conforming the biology of the animal are required. Education can be performed by vets and physicians as part of the One Health concept.",

The analysis of the text was based on an inductive thematic approach.\nResults: Resistance to disease and immune enhancement are properties attributed to Coragyps atratus when used for cancer treatment. The most recommended method of use is fresh blood ingestion, and the associated mechanism of action is transfer of immune factors to the individual who consumes it.\nConclusions: Use of Coragyps atratus as a treatment for cancer is a popular alternative therapy in Colombia. More studies are needed to understand the clinical effects of this intervention in cancer patients.",

            "abstractNote": "During the 1920s, the forerunners of exposure science collaborated with health professionals to investigate the causes of occupational diseases. With the birth of U.S. regulatory agencies in the 1970s, interest in the environmental origins of human diseases waned, and exposure scientists focused instead upon levels of selected contaminants in air and water. In fact, toxic chemicals enter the body not only from exogenous sources (air, water, diet, drugs, and radiation) but also from endogenous processes, including inflammation, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, existing diseases, infections, and gut flora. Thus, even though current evidence suggests that non-genetic factors contribute about 90% of the risks of chronic diseases, we have not explored the vast majority of human exposures that might initiate disease processes. The concept of the exposome, representing the totality of exposures received by a person during life, encompasses all sources of toxicants and, therefore, offers scientists an agnostic approach for investigating the environmental causes of chronic diseases. In this context, it is appropriate to regard the \"environment\" as the body's internal chemical environment and to define \"exposures\" as levels of biologically active chemicals in this internal environment. To explore the exposome, it makes sense to employ a topdown approach based upon biomonitoring (e.g. blood sampling) rather than a bottom-up approach that samples air, water, food, and so on. Because sources and levels of exposure change over time, exposomes can be constructed by analyzing toxicants in blood specimens obtained during critical stages of life. Initial investigations could use archived blood from prospective cohort studies to measure important classes of toxic chemicals, notably, reactive electrophiles, metals, metabolic products, hormone-like substances, and persistent organic compounds. The exposome offers health scientists an avenue for integrating research that is currently fractured along lines related to particular diseases and risk factors, and can thereby promote discovery of the key exposures responsible for chronic diseases. By embracing the exposome as its operational paradigm, exposure science can play a major role in discovering and mitigating these exposures.",

In addition, many researchers who publish such studies do not include or integrate data from all three domains of human, animal, and environmental health. This points to a critical need to unify guidelines for One Health studies. This report details the Checklist for One Health Epidemiological Reporting of Evidence (COHERE) to guide the design and publication format of future One Health studies. COHERE was developed by a core writing team and international expert review group that represents multiple disciplines, including human medicine, veterinary medicine, public health, allied professionals, clinical laboratory science, epidemiology, the social sciences, ecohealth and environmental health. The twin aims of the COHERE standards are to 1) improve the quality of reporting of observational or interventional epidemiological studies that collect and integrate data from humans, animals and/or vectors, and their environments; and 2) promote the concept that One Health studies should integrate knowledge from these three domains. The 19 standards in the COHERE checklist address descriptions of human populations, animal populations, environmental assessment, spatial and temporal relationships of data from the three domains, integration of analyses and interpretation, and inclusion of expertise in the research team from disciplines related to human health, animal health, and environmental health.",

            "abstractNote": "The evolution of self-fertilization from outcrossing has occurred on numerous occasions in flowering plants. This shift in mating system profoundly influences the morphology, ecology, genetics and evolution of selfing lineages. As a result, there has been sustained interest in understanding the mechanisms driving the evolution of selfing and its environmental context. Recently, patterns of molecular variation have been used to make inferences about the selective mechanisms associated with mating system transitions. However, these inferences can be complicated by the action of linked selection following the transition. Here, using multilocus simulations and comparative molecular data from related selfers and outcrossers, we demonstrate that there is little evidence for strong bottlenecks associated with initial transitions to selfing, and our simulation results cast doubt on whether it is possible to infer the role of bottlenecks associated with reproductive assurance in the evolution of selfing. They indicate that the effects of background selection on the loss of diversity and efficacy of selection occur rapidly following the shift to high selfing. Future comparative studies that integrate explicit ecological and genomic details are necessary for quantifying the independent and joint effects of selection and demography on transitions to selfing and the loss of genetic diversity.",

Despite early suggestions to the contrary, there is no conclusive historical evidence of King penguin inhabitation of the Antarctic Peninsula or the South Shetland Islands until the past decade. After a near-complete survey of Elephant Island, we report widespread presence of this species, including documented incubation at one site and molting at another. While we found no evidence of King penguins successfully fledging a chick at any of the sites where individuals were found, their presence across numerous sites suggests the potential for future range expansion in response to warming conditions.",

While the sweetest nectar offers the greatest energetic rewards, the sharp increase of viscosity with sugar concentration makes it the most difficult to transport. We here demonstrate that the sugar concentration that optimizes energy transport depends exclusively on the drinking technique employed. We identify three nectar drinking techniques: active suction, capillary suction, and viscous dipping. For each, we deduce the dependence of the volume intake rate on the nectar viscosity and thus infer an optimal sugar concentration consistent with laboratory measurements. Our results provide the first rationale for why suction feeders typically pollinate flowers with lower sugar concentration nectar than their counterparts that use viscous dipping.",

            "abstractNote": "Significance\n            The dilution effect hypothesis suggests that diverse ecological communities limit disease spread via several mechanisms. Therefore, biodiversity losses could worsen epidemics that harm humans and wildlife. However, there is contentious debate over whether the hypothesis applies broadly, especially for parasites that infect humans. We address this fundamental question with a formal meta-analysis of >200 assessments relating biodiversity to disease in >60 host–parasite systems. We find overwhelming evidence of dilution, which is independent of host density, study design, and type and specialization of parasites. A second analysis identified similar effects of diversity in plant–herbivore systems. Thus, biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and herbivory. Consequently, human-induced declines in biodiversity could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production.\n          , \n            Infectious diseases of humans, wildlife, and domesticated species are increasing worldwide, driving the need to understand the mechanisms that shape outbreaks. Simultaneously, human activities are drastically reducing biodiversity. These concurrent patterns have prompted repeated suggestions that biodiversity and disease are linked. For example, the dilution effect hypothesis posits that these patterns are causally related; diverse host communities inhibit the spread of parasites via several mechanisms, such as by regulating populations of susceptible hosts or interfering with parasite transmission. However, the generality of the dilution effect hypothesis remains controversial, especially for zoonotic diseases of humans. Here we provide broad evidence that host diversity inhibits parasite abundance using a meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61 parasite species. The magnitude of these effects was independent of host density, study design, and type and specialization of parasites, indicating that dilution was robust across all ecological contexts examined. However, the magnitude of dilution was more closely related to the frequency, rather than density, of focal host species. Importantly, observational studies overwhelmingly documented dilution effects, and there was also significant evidence for dilution effects of zoonotic parasites of humans. Thus, dilution effects occur commonly in nature, and they may modulate human disease risk. A second analysis identified similar effects of diversity in plant–herbivore systems. Thus, although there can be exceptions, our results indicate that biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and herbivory. Consequently, anthropogenic declines in biodiversity could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production.",

This study aimed to investigate risk factors for canine obesity in adult companion dogs across Zealand, Denmark. Client-owned dogs (> 2 years of age and without chronic illness) were recruited and examined at eight companion animal veterinary practices in areas with varying socio-economic characteristics. The body condition score (BCS) of the dogs was examined by two investigators based on a 9-point scoring scheme. Dog owners answered a questionnaire that had prompts regarding: 1) dog characteristics, including neuter status, 2) owner characteristics, 3) feeding and exercise practices and 4) the owners’ attachment to the dog. The eﬀect of these factors on BCS and the risk of being heavy/obese (BCS scores 7–9) were analysed in two separate analyses.",

This analysis provides a holistic view of the composition of the biosphere and allows us to observe broad patterns over taxonomic categories, geographic locations, and trophic modes.\n          , \n            A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.",

However, pollen from closely related individuals in the local neighbourhood might reduce fruit set or increase fruit abortion in self-incompatible tree species. We investigated the role of neighbourhood density and genetic relatedness on individual fruit set and abortion in the neotropical tree\n              Jacaranda copaia\n              in a large forest plot in central Panama. Using nested neighbourhood models, we found a strong positive effect of increased conspecific density on fruit set and maturation. However, high neighbourhood genetic relatedness interacted with density to reduce total fruit set and increase the proportion of aborted fruit. Our results imply a fitness advantage for individuals growing in high densities as measured by fruit set, but realized fruit set is lowered by increased neighbourhood relatedness. We hypothesize that the mechanism involved is increased visitation by density-dependent invertebrate pollinators in high-density populations, which increases pollen quantity and carry-over and increases fruit set and maturation, coupled with self-incompatibility at early and late stages due to biparental inbreeding that lowers fruit set and increases fruit abortion. Implications for the reproductive ecology and conservation of tropical tree communities in continuous and fragmented habitats are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The transition from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the most common evolutionary changes in plants, yet only about 10–15% of flowering plants are predominantly selfing. To explain this phenomenon, Stebbins proposed that selfing may be an ‘evolutionary dead end’. According to this hypothesis, transitions from outcrossing to selfing are irreversible, and selfing lineages suffer from an increased risk of extinction owing to a reduced potential for adaptation. Thus, although selfing can be advantageous in the short term, selfing lineages may be mostly short-lived owing to higher extinction rates. Here, we review recent results relevant to the ‘dead-end hypothesis’ of selfing and the maintenance of outcrossing over longer evolutionary time periods. In particular, we highlight recent results regarding diversification rates in self-incompatible and self-compatible taxa, and review evidence regarding the accumulation of deleterious mutations in selfing lineages. We conclude that while some aspects of the hypothesis of selfing as a dead end are supported by theory and empirical results, the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms remain unclear. We highlight the need for more studies on the effects of quantitative changes in outcrossing rates and on the potential for adaptation, particularly in selfing plants. In addition, there is growing evidence that transitions to selfing may themselves be drivers of speciation, and future studies of diversification and speciation should investigate this further.",

Drawing on such data for North America, Rosenberg\n              et al.\n              report wide-spread population declines of birds over the past half-century, resulting in the cumulative loss of billions of breeding individuals across a wide range of species and habitats. They show that declines are not restricted to rare and threatened species—those once considered common and wide-spread are also diminished. These results have major implications for ecosystem integrity, the conservation of wildlife more broadly, and policies associated with the protection of birds and native ecosystems on which they depend.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , this issue p.\n              120\n            \n          , \n            The cumulative loss of nearly 3 billion birds since 1970 across North American biomes signals a continuing avifaunal crisis.\n          , \n            Species extinctions have defined the global biodiversity crisis, but extinction begins with loss in abundance of individuals that can result in compositional and functional changes of ecosystems. Using multiple and independent monitoring networks, we report population losses across much of the North American avifauna over 48 years, including once-common species and from most biomes. Integration of range-wide population trajectories and size estimates indicates a net loss approaching 3 billion birds, or 29% of 1970 abundance. A continent-wide weather radar network also reveals a similarly steep decline in biomass passage of migrating birds over a recent 10-year period. This loss of bird abundance signals an urgent need to address threats to avert future avifaunal collapse and associated loss of ecosystem integrity, function, and services.",

But will the massive tree-planting effort learn from past failures?\n          , \n            \n              In 2007, the African Union launched the Great Green Wall, a project that aims to transform the lives of some 100 million people by planting a mosaic of trees, shrubs, and grasses along a corridor stretching some 8000 kilometers across Africa by 2030. The effort has struggled to make headway, but last month, the wall—which analysts estimate will cost at least $30 billion—got a major boost: a pledge of $14 billion in funding over 5 years from a coalition of international development banks and governments, including the European Union. The money is meant to accelerate an effort that promises to sustain livelihoods, conserve biodiversity, and combat desertification and climate change, French President Emmanuel Macron said in announcing the pledges on 11 January. Environmental restoration and community development specialists welcomed the news. But many are also apprehensive. In recent years, research by ecologists, economists, and social scientists has shown that many agroforestry projects in Africa and elsewhere have failed because they didn't adequately address fundamental social and ecological issues. Project leaders often didn't ask communities what kinds of trees they wanted, planted seedlings in places where they didn't belong, and did little to help the saplings survive. \"Tree planting is often viewed as the simple act of digging a hole,\" forest scientists Pedro Brancalion of the University of São Paulo, Piracicaba, and Karen Holl of the University of California, Santa Cruz, noted last year in a review of agroforestry projects in the \n              Journal of Applied Ecology\n              . \"But this short-term, naïve view has resulted in large quantities of money being spent on … efforts that have failed almost entirely.\"",

However, the ancestry of modern horses and the location and timing of their emergence remain unclear. Gaunitz\n              et al.\n              generated 42 ancient-horse genomes. Their source samples included the Botai archaeological site in Central Asia, considered to include the earliest domesticated horses. Unexpectedly, Botai horses were the ancestors not of modern domestic horses, but rather of modern Przewalski's horses. Thus, in contrast to current thinking on horse domestication, modern horses may have been domesticated in other, more Western, centers of origin.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , this issue p.\n              111\n            \n          , \n            The earliest herded horses were ancestors of feral Przewalski’s horses but not of modern domesticated horses.\n          , \n            The Eneolithic Botai culture of the Central Asian steppes provides the earliest archaeological evidence for horse husbandry, ~5500 years ago, but the exact nature of early horse domestication remains controversial. We generated 42 ancient-horse genomes, including 20 from Botai. Compared to 46 published ancient- and modern-horse genomes, our data indicate that Przewalski’s horses are the feral descendants of horses herded at Botai and not truly wild horses. All domestic horses dated from ~4000 years ago to present only show ~2.7% of Botai-related ancestry. This indicates that a massive genomic turnover underpins the expansion of the horse stock that gave rise to modern domesticates, which coincides with large-scale human population expansions during the Early Bronze Age.",

Seabirds that forage and breed across oceans globally have been recognized as sentinels of ocean health. Sydeman\n              et al.\n              looked across seabird species of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and found varying patterns. Northern Hemisphere species exhibited greater signs of stress and reduced breeding success, indicative of low fish resources. Southern Hemisphere species showed less impact on reproductive output, suggesting that the fish populations there have thus far been less disturbed. The differences across hemispheres indicate different strategies for conservation, with active recovery needed in the north and enhanced protection in the south.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , abf1772, this issue p.\n              980\n            \n          , \n            The breeding success of seabirds is tracking hemispheric differences in ocean warming and human impacts.\n          , \n            Climate change and other human activities are causing profound effects on marine ecosystem productivity. We show that the breeding success of seabirds is tracking hemispheric differences in ocean warming and human impacts, with the strongest effects on fish-eating, surface-foraging species in the north. Hemispheric asymmetry suggests the need for ocean management at hemispheric scales. For the north, tactical, climate-based recovery plans for forage fish resources are needed to recover seabird breeding productivity. In the south, lower-magnitude change in seabird productivity presents opportunities for strategic management approaches such as large marine protected areas to sustain food webs and maintain predator productivity. Global monitoring of seabird productivity enables the detection of ecosystem change in remote regions and contributes to our understanding of marine climate impacts on ecosystems.",

Skeptical journal editors declined to publish it. SinTce then, though, many commentators have echoed her message. And now the evidence has become clear: The pandemic has exacerbated existing gender disparities. According to a new study, mothers suffered a 33% larger drop in research hours compared with fathers in the months after the pandemic started. Mothers also took on more household and child care duties. The findings bolster calls for universities, funding agencies, and other organizations to do more to support female scientists.",

As species-speciﬁc information on levels of petrochemical exposure and toxicological response are lacking for the majority of marine species, a traitbased assessment to rank species vulnerabilities to petrochemical activities in the Gulf of Mexico can provide a more comprehensive and effective means to prioritize species, habitats, and ecosystems for improved management, restoration and recovery. To initiate and standardize this process, we developed a trait-based framework, applicable to a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate species, that can be used to rank relative population vulnerabilities of species to petrochemical activities in the Gulf of Mexico. Through expert consultation, 18 traits related to likelihood of exposure, individual sensitivity, and population resilience were identiﬁed and deﬁned. The resulting multi-taxonomic petrochemical vulnerability framework can be adapted and applied to a wide variety of species groups and geographic regions. Additional recommendations and guidance on the application of the framework to rank species vulnerabilities under speciﬁc petrochemical exposure scenarios, management needs or data limitations are also discussed.",

Intentional poisoning is a major threat to vultures in Africa, yet the impact on vulture populations of where poisoned carcasses are positioned is not known. We used re-sightings of 183 African white-backed vultures captured and tagged in two regions of South Africa, some 200 km apart, to estimate spatial differences in relative survival rates across life stages. Juvenile survival rates were similar in the two regions, whilst subadult and adult survival rates differed significantly. Using agent-based modelling, we show that this pattern of relative survival rates is consistent between regions that differ in intensity of poisoning, despite the proximity of the two regions. This may have important consequences for vulture conservation and the targeting of conservation efforts, particularly with regard to the efficacy of “vulture safe zones” around vulture breeding populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Originating in medical and veterinary spheres, the One Health concept stands as an open call for collaboration also between these disciplines or professions and those of environmental and social science. However, the communities of practice in question show uneasy or under-developed collaborations, due to a variety of factors. We argue that an important factor is the way issues are raised and questions are formulated, i.e., their framing. Based on complementary perspectives on health and knowledge, this overview provides an inter- and trans-disciplinary analysis of the role of the framing of « nature » in One Health discourses as a barrier or a facilitator to collaboration, as revealed by the scientific literature. We find that the lack of reflection by scientists about the framing under which they operate appears as a major factor of misunderstanding between disciplines, and a barrier for inter- and trans-disciplinary solutions to improve management of health risks and benefits. Hence, to build such solutions, framing will have to be a conscious and repeated step in the process, acknowledging and explaining the diversity of viewpoints and values. The interdisciplinary dialogues inherent in this process promote translation between scientific domains, policy-makers and citizens, with a critical but pluralistic recourse to various framings of health risks and benefits associated with nature, and a deep awareness of their practical and ethical consequences.",

In this study, we assess race differences in change in risk over 4 years among older whites, blacks, and Hispanics.\nMethod:  We examined race differences in 4-year change in individual biomarkers and a cumulative measure of risk—cardiometabolic risk (CMR)—using data for each respondent from two waves of the Health and Retirement Study’s biomarker assessment (n = 5,512). CMR is a count of high-risk cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers. We estimated mean CMR at baseline and follow-up by race/ethnicity, and used logistic regression to determine whether race differences exist in 4-year transitions between high- and low-risk states for individual biomarkers.\nResults:  Blacks had higher baseline CMR than whites and Hispanics and experienced an increase in risk over 4 years; conversely, CMR decreased among whites and Hispanics. Blacks were more likely to develop high-risk pulse pressure and high-risk hemoglobin A1c, which contributed to increases in CMR. Whites and Hispanics were more likely to become low-risk on C-reactive protein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol which contributed to declines in CMR. Race differences in transitions between risk states remained after controlling for social, behavioral, and health care-related factors. However, the racial patterning of these differences was influenced by disease diagnosis and medication use.\nConclusions:  We show that the cardiometabolic health of older blacks worsens as they age both absolutely and relative to that of whites and Hispanics because of poor blood pressure control and diabetes prevention.",

In the chapters of this book the definition of the exposome paradigm and concept is discussed. The most recent techniques based on OMICs, targeted and untargeted analysis for its characterization are described. The challenges arising from the amount of data that needs to be processed to understand the complex mechanism behind exposure and health outcome, as well as the latest statistical and data analysis methods have been discussed. Finally, multiple projects across the globe have or are currently tackling the application of the exposome concept to real studies, and these studies have been presented in this book. In this section, we will provide a chapter summary, and describe how the exposome paradigm has advanced since its definition. We will also explore question such as: what have we learned so far? Does the exposome paradigm provide valuable information? And what needs to be improved? Finally, we will discuss the possibility of future applications of the exposome in disease causality and personalized medicine.",

In tropical plant communities where plant species attract multiple species of pollinators, specialists may have advantages over generalists. The present study examined the pollination ecology of durian (Durio zibethinus) in intensively and non-intensively managed orchards in suburban habitats of Nakhon Nayok and Chanthaburi provinces, respectively, in Thailand. Manual-pollination yielded the greatest fruit set 60 d after pollination, followed by open pollination (mostly by pteropodid bats), and insect pollination, while non-pollinated flowers had no fruit set. Eonycteris spelaea was the major bat pollinator in both provinces. Bats found in suburban habitat of Nakhon Nayok were mostly Eonycteris spelaea (67%). Pollen of at least five plant species was found on Eonycteris spelaea fur, including Musa sp., Oroxylum indicum, Durio zibethinus, Bombax valetonii and an unknown species. Pollen of only two species, Oroxylum indicum and Musa sp., was observed on Cynopterus sphinx fur. The non-intensive orchards in Nakhon Nayok, where mixed-species gardens are maintained under more naturalistic conditions, might offer higher fruit set on average. Such conditions might maintain higher bats capture rate of natural pollinators and reduce the risk of pollination failure in comparison with intensively-managed durian orchards.",

Future research activities should focus on solutions to these problems arising at the interface between animals and humans. A 4‐fold classification of emerging zoonoses was proposed: Type 1: from wild animals to humans (Hanta); Type 1 plus: from wild animals to humans with further human‐to‐human transmission (AIDS); Type 2: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans (Avian flu) and Type 2 plus: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans, with further human‐to‐human transmission (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The resulting holistic approach to emerging infections links microbiology, veterinary medicine, human medicine, ecology, public health and epidemiology. As emerging ‘new’ respiratory viruses are identified in many wild and domestic animals, issues of interspecies transmission have become of increasing concern. The development of safe and effective human and veterinary vaccines is a priority. For example, the spread of different influenza viruses has stimulated influenza vaccine development, just as the spread of Ebola and Marburg viruses has led to new approaches to filovirus vaccines. Interdisciplinary collaboration has become essential because of the convergence of human disease, animal disease and a common approach to biosecurity. High containment pathogens pose a significant threat to public health systems, as well as a major research challenge, because of limited experience in case management, lack of appropriate resources in affected areas and a limited number of animal research facilities in developed countries. Animal models that mimic certain diseases are key elements for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, as well as for the development and efficacy testing of therapeutics and vaccines. An updated veterinary curriculum is essential to empower future graduates to work in an international environment, applying international standards for disease surveillance, veterinary public health, food safety and animal welfare.",

Representatives of 11 insect orders and spiders (Araneidae) contributed to the diet. Forest bats fed on 1-9 insect orders and araneids indicating opportunistic feeding behaviour, while the semi-urban bats fed on 3-8 insect orders and araneids indicating selective feeding behaviour. Although both the forest bats and semi-urban bats fed on the same spectrum of insect prey they showed differential use of them. Forest bats fed predominately on Coleoptera, Homoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Odonata and Araneidae, while the semi-urban bats preferred Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Orthoptera, Odonata, Hemiptera, Araneidae and Homoptera. Variation in terms of consumption of a particular kind of insect prey between the sexes was evident only among the semi urban bats only with respect to the most significant prey items coleopterans, lepidopterans and dipterans.",

            "abstractNote": "This paper analyzes the first checklist of insects from French Guiana. Compiled by a group of 70 experts based on published records, it comprises about 15 100 valid species names belonging to 20 orders and 322 families. Currently, about 17% of the species are only known from French Guiana or from the Guiana Shield region. Since Linné, the average rate of description has been 59 species per year, which has been increasing in the last 10 years. Based on a sample of recent taxonomic and faunistic papers covering 736 new species for French Guiana, 46% of the species came from new country records, the rest from new species descriptions. The rate of faunistic progress (new species or new records) is about 180 species per year over the last five years. Sixty-five percent of these faunal records came from non-professional entomologists and 74% of the holotypes of new species were collected by amateur entomologists. A rough extrapolation, using two different methods, provides a likely estimate of around 100 000 species, the most conservative estimate being 67 000 species and the highest 184 000. Therefore, an estimated 80% of the species remain to be recorded and, in a best-case scenario, at least 270 years would be needed to complete the biotic inventory, at the current rate of species descriptions and distribution records. Although no order is exhaustively inventoried, the most in need of study are Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Trichoptera; and in absolute numbers, Coleoptera. These results and the fundamental role of non-professional entomologists in collecting and describing new species are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The vulture populations in West Africa are undergoing dramatic decline over the last 30 years. Their particular ecology and sociality makes them vulnerable to various risks, including environmental changes, poisoning and bioaccumulation of toxic substances from agricultural products, pesticides, and veterinary drugs used in cattle livestock. In addition, these birds are subject to direct persecution for the trade of products used in traditional medicine. This manuscript analyzes the conservation status of eight vulture species in West Africa and the threats affecting their survival. In order to assess the conservation status of vultures in West Africa, this paper analyzes all the available literature that has been published in scientific peerreviewed journals, including also technical reports and unpublished reports related to the whole West African region. Overall, and despite the high risk of extinction facing several vulture species all throughout the world, our literature surveys revealed that the scientific papers on the conservation of West African vultures are relatively few. Therefore, due to limited available literature, the main causes of vulture declines in West Africa remain relatively unclear. Apparently, all African vultures suffer from similar threats, especially poisoning, habitat alteration and conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for trade, for use in traditional medicine and bushmeat, persecution and human disturbance. Our review also addresses future steps that are needed for reversing the negative population trend of their free-ranging populations, including some specific conservation measures that are proposed to mitigate their decline.",

            "abstractNote": "The lesser long nosed bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae), is a migratory species highly specialized for nectar and pollen consumption. Although they can consume fruits of columnar cactus (Family Cactaceae, tribes Pachicereeae and Cereeae), this habit has not been studied sufficiently to know the importance of this frugivory. Available information shows that this bat can consume actively fruit of columnar cactus, and indeed seven of these fruits have been cited as part of their diet in North America. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether other cactus fruits are edible for them. In Tehuacán Valley, located in south central México L. yerababuenae co-occur with 21 species of cactus that produce sweet, juicy and soft fruits, with small seeds appropriate to be eaten by the long-nosed bat. We conducted one study to determine the identity of cacti fruits eaten by L. yerababuenae, through the identification of seeds deposited as guano and obtained in the Obispo cave (municipality of Santiago Chazumba, Oaxaca). Seeds of all species of cactus that inhabit Tehuacan Valley were identificated in guano. We recollected 31,895 seeds inside the cave, but more than the 84% corresponded to four species of cacti seeds: Isolatocereus dumortieri, Stenocereus pruinosus, Stenocereus stellatus and Neobuxbaumia macrocephala. The species Escontria chiotilla, Pachicereus hollianus, Hilocereus undatus, Pachicereus fulviceps and Stenocereus treleasei, were rare and they had less than 20 seeds in the sample. So results obtained suggest that L. yerababuenae, may eat fruits as an important part of its diet, and probably serves as an important disperser of columnar cactus in dry environments of South Central Mexico.",

Honeybees had the highest visitation rates to flowers of the three species but are relatively ineffective pollinators. Bats had higher visitation rates to flowers of cardon than birds, which had higher visitation rates to flowers of saguaro and organ pipe than bats. Results of pollinator exclusion experiments indicated that visits by bats accounted for most of the fruit set in cardon, visits by birds and bees accounted for most of the fruit set in saguaro, and birds accounted for most of the fruit set in organ pipe. Hand-pollination experiments suggest that fruit set in females but not hermaphrodites of cardon, a trioecious species, and organ pipe is pollen-limited, probably owing to the scarcity of bats. Crude estimates of the per-visit effectiveness of different groups of pollinators for fruit set indicate that bats are somewhat more effective than birds and much more effective than bees. Competition for pollinators between the three species of cacti is reduced by seasonal or daily phenological differences. The flowering seasons of cardon and saguaro broadly overlap, but these species differ in the times their flowers open and close (earlier at night and the next morning, respectively, in cardon) and in their nectar secretion schedules. Saguaro flowers are more available to diurnal pollinators than those of cardon. The flowering peak of organ pipe occurs much later in the spring than the other two species; its opening and closing and nectar secretion schedules are similar to those of cardon. At our study site, the importance of bats as pollinators of columnar cacti is currently much lower than in other arid zone columnar cacti.",

            "abstractNote": "Hunting and loss of natural habitats increasingly threaten tropical biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly in Southeast Asia. Flying foxes often persist in anthropogenic areas where other wildlife has vanished, and where they play a significant ecological role in vegetation regeneration in disturbed habitats. Detailed knowledge on the foraging behavior of flying foxes is crucial for understanding how they survive in degraded habitats and for the management of human-wildlife conflicts. Thailand still harbors large colonies (several thousand individuals) of Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei), a species ranked as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, at temples situated in agricultural landscapes. We used high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) loggers to study the movement and foraging behavior of this species at 2 temples in central Thailand during 2 seasons. We analyzed GPS and acceleration data of 19 tagged individuals, and assessed habitat use and diet. Foraging individuals commuted between day roosts and foraging areas each night, followed by small-scale movements in foraging areas, and showed high site fidelity during the study period. Maximum linear distances between day roosts and foraging areas varied greatly between individuals (2.2—23.6 km) but were similar between seasons. Tracked bats mostly foraged in farmland, plantations, and gardens, yet our data indicate that small mangrove remnants constitute important habitat components for Lyle's flying fox. We recorded a highly diverse diet of 34 food plant species, comprised of exotic crops and native plants as available. Our results suggest that conservation and landscape managers should preserve remaining native trees and natural vegetation in the study area as resources for Lyle's flying fox, at the same time reducing potential for conflicts between bats and humans on crops. They can further be used for public information campaigns integrating the potential of Lyle's flying fox as dispersers of useful plants and the human health risks through zoonotic diseases associated with hunting and consumption of this species. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.",
