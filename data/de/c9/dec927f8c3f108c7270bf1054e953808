We cultured psychrotolerant fungi from the external surface and faeces of live Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and from the intestinal contents of a single freshly killed P. maniculatus, overwintering in a white-nose syndrome positive bat hibernaculum and from adjacent summer forest in eastern Canada. A low diversity of psychrotolerant fungi was cultured from P. maniculatus compared with that found in previous studies of the mycoflora of bats and arthropods occupying bat hibernacula in the region. Although the grooming habits of P. maniculatus may reduce the accumulation of a diverse psychrotolerant fungal assemblage on their external surface, we demonstrate that active euthermic mammals in underground habitats can carry viable spores of psychrotolerant fungi, both externally and internally. Small rodents using cave habitats may also play a role in dispersing psychrotolerant fungi between caves and suitable low-temperature habitats (i.e., burrows) in adjacent forest.",

            "abstractNote": "Islands and insular biotas have been recognized as ideal models for studying adaptive radiations and evolutionary processes. In the present study we investigated the Jamaican fruit-eating bat, Artibeus jamaicensis from Cozumel Island, to evaluate the effect of ecological features on genetic diversity and structure across three different environments, semi-evergreen tropical forest, mangrove, and cenotes, using six microsatellite loci in 105 individuals. Genetic diversity was relatively high (forest HO = 0.693, HNei = 0.825; mangrove HO = 0.702, HNei = 0.710; cenotes HO = 0.695, HNei = 0.847). Pairwise genetic differentiation measures between localities were not significant and the overall level of differentiation was markedly low (FST = 0.009, G’ST = 0.088). Likewise, results showed that A. jamaicensis consists of one genetic group and relatedness among individuals was low. Results are concordant with our predictions that the island population will show high genetic diversity and null structure at the fine spatial scale examined. We conclude that ecological features like dispersal and generalist habits are the factors influencing population structure and genetic diversity of A. jamaicensis on the island, and that factors like the species polygynous mating system, female philopatry and male differential dispersal do not prevail in the island population. Cozumel Island is facing severe conservation problems, mainly from habitat perturbation, urbanization and introduction of exotic species, hence the present genetic information is of great value as a basis for future research and protection of the species.",

We captured a juvenile Hoary Bat in south-central New Hampshire during July of 2007 and monitored its roosting behavior for ten days and its foraging behavior for one night. The bat roosted with two other bats, which we presumed were its mother and sibling. These bats roosted exclusively in Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock Tree) and tended to roost near tree tops in the forest canopy. The radiotagged bat used at least six roost trees and changed roost location eight times during the ten-day observation period. Although roost-tree fidelity was low, all roost trees were located within a maximum circular area of 0.5 ha. The bat foraged over an estimated 156-ha area of mostly forest habitat (68%), with additional open habitats (15%) and wetlands (17%). These data are the first observations of roosting and foraging behaviors by the Hoary Bat in the northeastern region of its geographic range.",

The new species is similar in size to L. carrikeri and L. schulzi. Lophostoma sp. nov. can be most easily recognized by its combination of white venter, postauricular patches connected by a thin line of pale hair to the white fur on the chest, elongated clitoris and swollen labia, less strongly developed lateral projection of mastoid processes, well-marked indentation on the lingual cingulum of the upper canine, well-developed P3, well-developed posterior lingual cusp on the cingulum of P4, and parastyle absent on M1 and M2. We present a dichotomous key for the genus Lophostoma and a map showing all the localities where white-bellied Lophostoma have been recorded.",

P. umbratus occurs in the Andean and costal mountain systems of Venezuela and Colombia. P. nigellus occurs along the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia. Both species are medium-sized members of the genus possessing confusing taxonomic histories that have never intersected. Four of the 21 recognized species of Platyrrhinus, among them P. umbratus, do not have their taxonomic identiﬁcation conﬁrmed by molecular analyses. We provide the ﬁrst genetic data (Cyt-b and ND2 sequences) for the species. Phylogenetic analyses including the new genetic data lead to the conclusion that P. umbratus and P. nigellus are conspeciﬁc. Through the use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM), we conﬁrm that P. umbratus and P. nigellus share high morphometric and environmental similarities. Based on such integrative approach, we regard P. nigellus as a junior synonym of P. umbratus. We provide an emended diagnosis of P. umbratus (subsuming P. nigellus) and draw morphological comparisons with other species of the genus with which it is sympatric. The conservation status of P. umbratus needs to be determined. The high rate of habitat destruction in the tropical Andes may soon cause P. umbratus to be reassigned to the Near-Threatened (NT) category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",

Caused by the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans, WNS specifically affects bats during hibernation. We describe temperature-dependent growth performance and morphology for six independent isolates of G. destructans from North America and Europe. Thermal performance curves for all isolates displayed an intermediate peak with rapid decline in performance above the peak. Optimal temperatures for growth were between 12.5 and 15.8°C, and the upper critical temperature for growth was between 19.0 and 19.8°C. Growth rates varied across isolates, irrespective of geographic origin, and above 12°C all isolates displayed atypical morphology that may have implications for proliferation of the fungus. This study demonstrates that small variations in temperature, consistent with those inherent of bat hibernacula, affect growth performance and physiology of G. destructans, which may influence temperature-dependent progression and severity of WNS in wild bats.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is causing signiﬁcant declines in populations of North American hibernating bats, and recent western and southern expansions of the disease have placed additional species at risk. Understanding differences in species susceptibility and identifying management actions to reduce mortality of bats from WNS are top research priorities. However, the use of wild-caught susceptible bats, such as Myotis lucifugus, as model species for WNS research is problematic and places additional pressure on remnant populations. We investigated the feasibility of using Tadarida brasiliensis, a highly abundant species of bat that tolerates captivity, as the basis for an experimental animal model for WNS. Using methods previously established to conﬁrm the etiology of WNS in M. lucifugus, we experimentally infected 11 T. brasiliensis bats with Pseudogymnoascus destructans in the laboratory under conditions that induced hibernation. We detected P. destructans on all 11 experimentally infected bats, 7 of which exhibited localized proliferation of hyphae within the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue, similar to invasive cutaneous ascomycosis observed in M. lucifugus bats with WNS. However, the distribution of lesions across wing membranes of T. brasiliensis bats was limited, and only one discrete “cupping erosion,” diagnostic for WNS, was identiﬁed. Thus, the rarity of lesions deﬁnitive for WNS suggests that T. brasiliensis does not likely represent an appropriate model for studying the pathophysiology of this disease. Nonetheless, the results of this study prompt questions concerning the potential for free-ranging, migratory T. brasiliensis bats to become infected with P. destructans and move the fungal pathogen between roost sites used by species susceptible to WNS.",

Seed production is one possible point of recruitment failure, and one that the spatial arrangement of trees may affect.We sampled 118 Eucalyptus microcarpa (Myrtaceae) trees to compare and analyse the determinants of seed production in this dominant tree of modiﬁed, fragmented temperate grassy woodlands, which extend over much of southeastern Australia. Fecundity was estimated as the seed crop measured on leaf mass and whole tree bases and was compared between categories of tree conﬁguration.We also modelled fecundity using boosted regression trees, a new and ﬂexible tool. Fecundity on a leaf mass basis was predominantly inﬂuenced by environmental factors (topographic ‘wetness’, slope, soil type), rather than by local tree density and conﬁguration. Fewer seed per unit leaf mass were produced on ﬂat and topographically wet sites, reﬂecting poor tolerance of waterlogging by E. microcarpa. By contrast, whole tree fecundity was little inﬂuenced by environmental factors. Local tree density and conﬁguration did inﬂuence whole tree fecundity, which was high in solitary and woodland-spaced trees and reduced under high local density. We found little evidence for reduced fecundity of E. microcarpa in solitary trees. This points to the importance of scattered trees as sources of seed for tree recruitment and for natural regeneration of landscape level tree cover. Considerable uncertainty remains in modelled seed supply, and may be reduced with sampling across multiple years and greater environmental and spatial domains.",

            "abstractNote": "Optimal foraging theory predicts that predators are selective when faced with abundant prey, but become less picky when prey gets sparse. Insectivorous bats in temperate regions are faced with the challenge of building up fat reserves vital for hibernation during a period of decreasing arthropod abundances. According to optimal foraging theory, prehibernating bats should adopt a less selective feeding behaviour –yet empirical studies have revealed many apparently generalized species to be composed of specialist individuals. Targeting the diet of the bat Myotis daubentonii, we used a combination of molecular techniques to test for seasonal changes in prey selectivity and individual-level variation in prey preferences. DNA metabarcoding was used to characterize both the prey contents of bat droppings and the insect community available as prey. To test for dietary differences among M. daubentonii individuals, we used ten microsatellite loci to assign droppings to individual bats. The comparison between consumed and available prey revealed a preference for certain prey items regardless of availability. Nonbiting midges (Chironomidae) remained the most highly consumed prey at all times, despite a signiﬁcant increase in the availability of black ﬂies (Simuliidae) towards the end of the season. The bats sampled showed no evidence of individual specialization in dietary preferences. Overall, our approach offers little support for optimal foraging theory. Thus, it shows how novel combinations of genetic markers can be used to test general theory, targeting patterns at both the level of prey communities and individual predators.",

We recently showed they harbour bacterial pathogen\n              Klebsiella pneumoniae\n              and closely related species in the\n              K\n              .\n              pneumoniae\n              species complex (\n              Kp\n              SC); however, the dynamics of\n              Kp\n              SC transmission and gene flow within flying fox colonies are poorly understood. High‐resolution genome comparisons of 39\n              Kp\n              SC isolates from grey‐headed flying foxes identified five putative strain transmission clusters (four intra‐ and one inter‐colony). The instance of inter‐colony strain transmission of\n              K\n              .\n              africana\n              was found between two flying fox populations within flying distance, indicating either direct or indirect transmission through a common food/water source. All 11 plasmids identified within the\n              Kp\n              SC isolates showed 73% coverage (mean) and ≥95% identity to human‐associated\n              Kp\n              SC plasmids, indicating gene flow between human clinical and grey‐headed flying fox isolates. Along with strain transmission, inter‐species horizontal plasmid transmission between\n              K\n              .\n              pneumoniae\n              and\n              Klebsiella africana\n              was also identified within a flying fox colony. Finally, genome‐scale metabolic models were generated to predict and compare substrate usage to previously published\n              Kp\n              SC models, from human and environmental sources. These models indicated no distinction on the basis of metabolic capabilities. Instead, metabolic capabilities were consistent with population structure and ST/lineage.",

Female Angolan free-tailed bats displayed a seasonal bimodally polyoestrous reproductive pattern. Parturition in December was followed closely by a postpartum oestrus. Ovarian follicle and endometrium cycles also closely followed the breeding season. The reproductive tract displayed complete dextral dominance with the right ovary and uterus being functionally dominant. Luteal activity was maintained throughout pregnancy and healthy corpora lutea were observed until late in pregnancy. Shedding of the zona pellucida occurred in the oviduct in the region of the ampulla±isthmus junction. The embryo entered the uterus as a morula, where it was transformed into a unilaminar, free-lying blastocyst. A unique feature of the pre-implantation uterus was the formation of a distinct decidua at the implantation site on the mesometrial side. Implantation in the Angolan free-tailed bat was centric and super®cial. First attachment of the trophoblast to the endometrium was mesometrial. The formation of a pre-placental pad of trophoblast cells was also initiated on the mesometrial side, while orientation of the embryonic disc was anti-mesometrial. Placental development occurred in the abembryonic hemisphere. Proliferation of the trophoblast over the embryonic hemisphere was slow and a bilaminar arrangement of the trophoblast was not observed in this region until after the primitive streak stage.",

Racemes persist, developing intermittently pedunculate capitula over a period of more than one year. The brush‐type, whitish flower heads are nocturnal in anthesis and active only a single night. Florets are relatively large and stout for the genus, hermaphroditic, with stiff filaments and style, and converge towards the periphery of the raceme. When expanding at dusk, the heads produce large nectar drops (up to 173 μl per head), that averages 25–29% sucrose. Production starts sequentially among florets of a capitulum. The drops are freely exposed, held between the filaments. The glossophagine bat\n              Lonchophylla mordax\n              was observed as the only legitimate visitor; hummingbirds exploited worn capitula at daytime, but did not pollinate. The bats lapped the nectar while hovering without apparently putting out their tongues. Pollen transmission was by the snout and probably by touching neighbouring flower heads with the wings. The blossoms, of a genus predominantly entomophilous, reveal habitual adaptation to bat pollination in most of their features. Small size (14 mm in diam.) and lack of a perceptible scent suggest that an evolutionary shift towards chiropterophily is still incomplete. A brief survey of the known distribution of bat pollination in Mimosaceae is appended.",

            "abstractNote": "We tested the suitability of fecal sexual steroid hormone metabolites for use in endocrinological studies of freeranging, small bats. We monitored estrogen and 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites in fecal samples collected daily from 19 free-ranging female Saccopteryx bilineata during the assumed mating season. Median fecal estrogen metabolite levels equaled 0.09 ng/g for the pre- and postovulatory periods and 4.2 ng/g for the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in female S. bilineata. Median fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolite levels were 50.9 ng/g in preestrous, 88.8 ng/g in estrous, and 190.2 ng/g in postestrous females. Reliability of fecal steroid metabolite analysis was supported by results of video observations. Two successful copulations for a single male–female pair were recorded; mating coincided with peak fecal estrogen levels (7.0 ng/g) in the copulating female. In contrast, 2 observed mating attempts in a 2nd male–female pair occurred approximately 19 days after the female’s physiological estrus and fecal estrogen metabolites in the rejecting female were only 0.2 ng/g. Fecal 20oxo-pregnane levels were almost 3 times lower in fecal samples collected from the copulating female than those from the rejecting female (157 ng/g versus 410 ng/g). All females that were still present in the colony 6 months later gave birth to a single offspring between late May and early June. Gestation length averaged (mean 6 SE) 169 6 2 days. During the 20 days preceding parturition, fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites were approximately 100 times higher than during the mating period. Fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites of lactating females were comparable to those during the mating season. Noninvasive fecal steroid analysis can be a valuable tool for monitoring reproductive events in colonies of free-ranging small-sized bats.",

However, later in succession bats may carry seeds in both directions. We used an isotopic approach to reveal the direction of seed transfer mediated by three co-existing short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia castanea, C. sowelli and C. perspicillata) between a forest and an adjacent mid-successional site (>15 y since deforestation); two habitats where individuals of the genus Piper differed in stable carbon isotope ratios by ∼2.5‰. In a feeding experiment, we conﬁrmed that δ13C of seeds is not altered by digestive processes. We then collected seeds defecated by bats of the genus Carollia and found that δ13C of these seeds is higher than those of Piper individuals growing in the forest, irrespective of whether bats were captured in or outside the forest. We conclude that bats of the genus Carollia were more likely to carry seeds from successional areas into the forest than in the opposite direction.",

Using a stable isotope approach, we tested in colonies of vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) whether food sharing occurs among few or many females; vampires are known to regurgitate recently ingested blood for starving conspeciﬁcs. Accordingly, the isotopic signatures of vampires depend not only on individual prey choice but also on the extent of food sharing among isotopically contrasting conspeciﬁcs. By measuring the stable carbon isotope ratio in tissues with varying isotopic retention in individual vampires (blood: approx. 2 wk; wing membrane tissue: approx. 2 mo; fur: >6 mo), we estimated the variation in the percentages of carbon derived from pasture (via blood from cattle and horses). We expected to ﬁnd narrow ranges of percentages in individual vampires, because we anticipated food sharing only within small female networks if food sharing happened at all. Overall, vampire bats obtained 79.2 Æ 12.3% of carbon from grazers. The range of percentages was small within the majority of individuals in relation to that across all individuals, suggesting that most vampires were isotopic specialists. We expected females to be more isotopically generalistic than males, as food sharing was observed to occur more often between females than between males. Indeed, stable isotope evidence suggested that more females obtained carbon from isotopically contrasting sources than males. This pattern is consistent with food sharing in small groups of female vampires, provided that food sharing occurred at all.",

It has been difficult to ascertain how closely biological reality matches model predictions, largely because of the technical challenges of accurately measuring the power expended when an animal flies. We designed a study to measure flight speed-dependent aerodynamic power directly from the kinetic energy contained in the wake of bats flying in a wind tunnel. We compared these measurements with two theoretical predictions that have been used for several decades in diverse fields of vertebrate biology and to metabolic measurements from a previous study using the same individuals. A high-accuracy displaced laser sheet stereo particle image velocimetry experimental design measured the wake velocities in the Trefftz plane behind four bats flying over a range of speeds (3–7 m s\n              −1\n              ). We computed the aerodynamic power contained in the wake using a novel interpolation method and compared these results with the power predicted by Pennycuick's and Rayner's models. The measured aerodynamic power falls between the two theoretical predictions, demonstrating that the models effectively predict the appropriate range of flight power, but the models do not accurately predict minimum power or maximum range speeds. Mechanical efficiency—the ratio of aerodynamic power output to metabolic power input—varied from 5.9% to 9.8% for the same individuals, changing with flight speed.",

We present the results of the first study to assess whether litters of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) containing dizygotic twins share the same father. We sampled 26 mother–offspring triads from three colonies in Indiana and Illinois, as well as 299 additional adults (237 females and 62 males) from these colonies and six other maternity colonies in the same area in 1997–1998. All individuals were genotyped at nine highly variable autosomal microsatellite loci and one X-linked locus. We assessed multiple paternity using autosomal and X-linked locus exclusions, and using maximum-likelihood methods. All methods confirmed multiple paternity within litters, and the maximum-likelihood analyses indicated that almost half of the sampled litters were composed of maternal half-siblings rather than full-siblings. Our results highlight the potential importance of post-copulatory mechanisms of paternity determination in the mating system of big brown bats, and have important implications for gene flow and population structuring in this species.",

The additional time associated with finding or assessing the availability of a new roost, moving offspring to the new roost, coordinating with other group members, and meeting any increased energetic demands that may be associated with these behaviors may influence the number and duration of feeding bouts of reproductive females. To examine the influence of roost-switching on nocturnal activity patterns we radio-tagged lactating female silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and monitored them on nights when they moved to a new roost site and nights when no roost shift occurred. The typical activity pattern on a non-move night consisted of an initial long bout away from the day roost (median length: 177.4 min) followed by alternating bouts in (50.6 min) and away (57.0 min) from the roost for the rest of the night. On move nights bats reduced the length of their first absent period (82.7 min) and increased the number of trips from the roost, although neither the length of these subsequent absent periods nor the total time absent from the roosts differed from non-move nights. Similarly, total time spent in roosts did not differ between move and non-move nights, but bats made more and shorter visits on move nights. Visits to original and new roosts were not synchronous among colony members, and the length of time for individuals from the same colony to move to a new roost varied from 1 to 4 h. Our results indicate that roost switching did not influence the total time spent in or away from day roosts. Rather, bats moved between the original roost, the new roost, and foraging areas with much greater frequency on move nights.",

            "abstractNote": "The lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) and the long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are Aotearoa New Zealand’s only native extant terrestrial mammals and are believed to have migrated from Australia. Long-tailed bats arrived in New Zealand an estimated two million years ago and are closely related to other Australian bat species. Lesser short-tailed bats, in contrast, are the only extant species within the Mystacinidae and are estimated to have been living in isolation in New Zealand for the past 16–18 million years. Throughout this period of isolation, lesser short-tailed bats have become one of the most terrestrial bats in the world. Through a metatranscriptomic analysis of guano samples from eight locations across New Zealand, we aimed to characterise the viromes of New Zealand’s bats and determine whether viruses have jumped between these species over the past two million years. High viral richness was observed among long-tailed bats with viruses spanning seven different viral families. In contrast, no bat-specific viruses were identified in lesser short-tailed bats. Both bat species harboured an abundance of likely dietary- and environment-associated viruses. We also identified alphacoronaviruses in long-tailed bat guano that had previously been identified in lesser short-tailed bats, suggesting that these viruses had jumped the species barrier after long-tailed bats migrated to New Zealand. Of note, an alphacoronavirus species discovered here possessed a complete genome of only 22,416 nucleotides with entire deletions or truncations of several non-structural proteins, thereby representing what may be the shortest genome within the Coronaviridae identified to date. Overall, this study has revealed a diverse range of novel viruses harboured by New Zealand’s only native terrestrial mammals, in turn expanding our understanding of bat viral dynamics and evolution globally.",

Bats are the only native land dwelling mammals on this archipelago, but the biogeographical origins for the vast majority of species within this group are ambiguous. We report here genetic analyses based on two mitochondrial DNA markers to infer the origin of Comorian bats belonging to a reputed species complex of Miniopterus that is further distributed across Africa and Madagascar. Phylogenetic reconstructions show that east African M. minor are not closely related to the insular Miniopterus of Madagascar and the Comoros (Grande Comore and Anjouan). The latter cluster into two distinct, monophyletic clades (Clade 1 and Clade 2). Representatives of these clades occur sympatrically both on the Comoros and on Madagascar, and are distinguished by a large genetic distance (K2P: 9.9% for cytochrome b). No haplotypes are shared between any islands, suggesting the absence of contemporary gene flow. Populations of the widespread Clade 1 are furthermore characterized by a significant inter-island structure (FCT = 0.249), and by high haplotype and nucleotide diversities (h = 0.90–0.98, p = 0.04–0.06). Demographic analyses of Clade 1 suggest secondary contact between two distinct phylogroups (Subclade 1 A and 1B) that reached Grande Comore and Anjouan, and a large, stable population with a long evolutionary history on Madagascar. These results and the current distribution of related lineages suggest that the Comoros were colonized independently at least two or three times by ancestors from Madagascar.",

The genome is a circular molecule of 16,463 bp length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and a control region. Most of the genes were encoded on the H-strand, except for 8 tRNA and ND6 genes. Phylogenetic trees of the complete mitochondrial genome were constructed using RAxML. Our result suggests that M. cyclotis is closely related to M. leucogaster from Korea. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of M. cyclotis will be helpful for future taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on Murina.",

It is easily distinguished from other Glossophaginae because of its tricolored dorsal pelage with a dark basal band, well-furred elbow, lack of lower incisors, and wing membrane attached to the foot at about mid-length of the metatarsals. L. obscura is a foliage-roosting species, and primarily feeds on nectar and pollen. The species is rare because locally it occurs in low numbers. Despite the lack of information and low abundance, L. obscura is listed as a species of “Least Concern” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.",

There are two currently recognized species within the P. personatus complex, for which we examined 235 cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences and 138 cytochrome b (Cytb) sequences in order to explore its genetic variation in Mexico as well as in Central and South America. Our results reveal considerable differences in the genetic structure inside this species complex, indicating five genetic lineages: 1) Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Pacific coastal plain to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, 2) Southeastern Mexico, 3) Guatemala, 4) Guyana and Suriname-COI/Guyana and Venezuela-Cytb, and 5) Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Brazil. In addition, we used the isolation-with-migration coalescent method to estimate divergence times. The results indicate that vicariant events occurred roughly 1,624,000–2,450,000 years ago during the Early Pleistocene, wherein Central America was the center of two separate diversification processes, one toward Mexico and the other South America. The intraspecific lineages obtained for P. personatus demonstrate the need to reevaluate the species complex limits of this taxon.",

The wingspan, wing loading and aspect ratio of the two species were relatively low, and those of T. pachypus were lower compared with T. robustula. The echolocation calls of T. pachypus and T. robustula consist of a broadband frequency modulated (FM) sweep followed by a short narrowband FM sweep. The dominant frequency of calls of T. pachypus was 65.1 kHz, whereas that of T. robustula was 57.7 kHz. The call frequencies (including highest frequency of the call, lowest frequency of the call and frequency of the call that contained most energy) of T. pachypus were higher than those of T. robustula, and the pulse duration of the former was longer than that of the latter. The inter-pulse interval and bandwidth of the calls were not signiﬁcantly different between the two species. Tylonycteris pachypus foraged in more complex environments than T. robustula, although the two species were both netted in edge habitats (around trees or houses), along pathways and in the tops of trees. Tylonycteris pachypus ﬂew slower (straight level ﬂight speed, 4.3 m sÀ1) than T. robustula (straight level ﬂight speed, 4.8 m sÀ1). We discuss the relationship between wing morphology, echolocation calls, foraging behaviour and ﬂight speed, and demonstrate resource partitioning between these two species in terms of morphological and behavioural factors.",

            "abstractNote": "Rhinolophids (horseshoe bats) are a widespread and diverse family. Their high level of morphological convergence has made taxonomic identification and estimation of species diversity problematic. The Rhinolophus philippinensis group, which is characterized with huge ears and low echolocation frequency relative to body size, is a specific group among all the rhinolophid groups, but the phylogeny of this group is poorly understood. In this study, we performed integrated analyses of the morphology, acoustic and genetic data and constructed the first multilocus phylogeny for the philippinensis group using four mitochondrial genes, four autosomal introns and one Y‐linked intron in 95 specimens representing nine taxa. Phylogenies were constructed based on concatenated phylogenetic methods and a multilocus coalescence approach. The estimated phylogenies revealed the polyphyly of the philippinensis group. Except for R. philippinensis, all the other species in this group formed a monophyletic cluster, named herewith as “R. macrotis” species group. Phylogenies, genetic and phenotypic divergence, and species delimitation analyses supported the revised status of R. paradoxolophus as a subspecies of R. rex, R. cf. macrotis as a subspecies of R. macrotis, and R. huananus and R. cf. siamensis as junior synonyms of R. siamensis. Significant discordances were found between the mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting or ancient introgression events within the philippinensis group. The macrotis group appeared to have undergone a rapid radiation approximately 2.57 million years ago during the early Pleistocene period due to palaeoclimatic oscillations. Reconstruction of the ancestral ranges suggested a wide distribution of the common ancestor for the philippinensis and macrotis groups.",

            "abstractNote": "Scotophilus kuhlii is distributed in many urban environments, yet the ecology of this species is poorly known. The morphology, echolocation call structure, diet, and foraging areas of S. kuhlii were studied on Hainan Island, south China from March to November 2006. Data from 85 individuals indicate that S. kuhlii is a medium-sized bat with 50.41 ± 1.36 (0 ± SE) mm forearm length and 19.81 ± 3.47 g body mass. The wing morphology with high wing-loading (11.38 ± 1.95 N/m2) and moderate aspect ratio (6.96 ± 0.75) indicates that S. kuhlii flies fast and forages in open habitat and at the edges of cluttered environments. Echolocation calls of S. kuhlii consist of a fundamental and up to four harmonics, with a dominant frequency of 45.72 ± 2.09 kHz, and call shape suggests that this species is adapted to forage in open environments. Data from mist-netting and acoustic detection indicated that S. kuhlii foraged mainly around the crown of trees and street lights. Nine insect orders were recorded in its diet, with Lepidoptera (97.46%, by frequency) and Coleoptera (64.72 ± 2.37%, by volume) constituting the main prey, together with Hemiptera (19.99 ± 1.25%) and Hymenoptera (9.43 ± 1.14%). There was significant seasonal variation in the diet of S. kuhlii: Coleoptera increased from March to May, and then decreased to August, while Hemiptera and Hymenoptera showed the inverse trend.",

To investigate the DNA faecal prevalence of the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum, we sampled 23 lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) maternity colonies located in buildings (churches, barns) in rural villages of eastern France. A total of 552 faecal samples were collected from 278 individuals. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was detected in the faeces of 63 individuals (22.7%). Such high prevalence might suggest persistent infection in bats and/or a frequent consumption of insect preys carrying bacteria. Faecal DNA prevalence varied highly among colonies but was not related to the colony size. Faecal DNA prevalence was the highest in the Jura Department, where the density of ticks is known to be the highest across the study area. Because the sampled bats live in close proximity to humans, we discuss how concerning the presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in bat guano is for humans frequenting places of worship that shelter bats. We also advocate future research to understand what a high faecal DNA prevalence in bat guano really implicates in terms of bacteria transmission.",

Animals studied A total of 36 bats belonging to three different species (Desmodus rotundus, Diameus youngi, and Artibeus lituratus) were used to perform this investigation. Thirteen Diameus youngi and six Desmodus rotundus were trapped in a cave, and 17 captive Artibeus lituratus were obtained from an experimental colony. Both free-ranging and captive bats were free of apparent ocular or systemic disease. Procedures Corneal and conjunctival swabs were collected from both eyes to identify the resident bacterial microbiota.\nResults Seventeen bats had positive bacterial cultures in one or both eyes. Considering all isolates, Gram-positive bacteria (82.6%) predominated over those that were Gramnegative bacteria (17.4%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (30.4%) were the most isolated genus, followed by Bacillus spp. (26%) and Corynebacterium spp. (21%). Only four Gram-negative species were isolated: Shigella spp., Hafnia alvei, Morganella morganii, and Flavobacterium odoratum.\nConclusions In this study, bacterial microbiota of the ocular surface of bats was described, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated type of microorganism from healthy bat eyes.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Hibernation, a survival strategy in mammals for extreme climates, induces physiological phenomena such as ischemia–reperfusion and metabolic shifts that hold great potential for advancements in modern medicine. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underpinning hibernation remain largely unclear. This study used RNA‐seq and Iso‐seq techniques to investigate the changes in liver transcriptome expression of\n              Rhinolophus pusillus\n              during hibernation and active periods, as well as under different microhabitat temperatures. We identified 11 457 differentially expressed genes during hibernation and active periods, of which 395 showed significant differential expression. Genes associated with fatty acid catabolism were significantly upregulated during hibernation, whereas genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and glycogen synthesis were downregulated. Conversely, immune‐related genes displayed differential expression patterns: genes tied to innate immunity were significantly upregulated, while those linked to adaptive immunity and inflammatory response were downregulated. The analysis of transcriptomic data obtained from different microhabitat temperatures revealed that\n              R. pusillus\n              exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism in lower microhabitat temperature. This upregulation facilitated an enhanced utilization rate of triglyceride, ultimately resulting in increased energy provision for the organism. Additionally,\n              R. pusillus\n              upregulated gluconeogenesis‐related genes regardless of the microhabitat temperature, demonstrating the importance of maintaining blood glucose levels during hibernation. Our transcriptomic data reveal that these changes in liver gene expression optimize energy allocation during hibernation, suggesting that liver tissue adaptively responds to the inherent stress of its function during hibernation. This study sheds light on the role of differential gene expression in promoting more efficient energy allocation during hibernation. It contributes to our understanding of how liver tissue adapts to the stressors associated with this state.",

Observations during 3 years showed that their wintering was successful. The temperature of the body surface of hibernating animals was –1.8°C in January. The surface temperature of the walls of the tunnel close to the animals was ‒1.9°C, although the air temperature outside the wintering spot was extremely low, –45…–50°C. Winter hibernation consisted of long stupors and short periodic awakenings. During spontaneous awakenings, the bats moved in the tunnel, flied and emitted sounds.",

Artiﬁcial selection for increased resistance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium was performed, and after eight generations, the average median effective concentration increased from 61 to 180 ␮g/L. No differences in life span, offspring production, time to ﬁrst brood, number of offspring in the ﬁrst brood, or intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were observed between the cadmiumadapted population and the controls under ideal conditions or under conditions of temperature or feeding ration stress, but cadmiumadapted daphnids were smaller. Control and cadmium-adapted populations were equally sensitive to copper and malathion, but the cadmium-adapted population was less sensitive to lead and more sensitive to phenol. Analysis of ampliﬁed fragment-length polymorphisms indicated a signiﬁcant decrease in genetic diversity in the cadmium-adapted population. Although the evolved cadmium resistance would allow adapted populations to exist in areas where cadmium concentrations would be toxic to unadapted populations, the decreased genetic diversity, smaller size, and increased sensitivity to at least one other toxicant could reduce the probability of long-term survival even in the absence of future cadmium exposure.",

While searching and hunting for prey, bats experience sonar interference, not only from densely cluttered environments, but also from calls of conspecifics foraging in close proximity. Previous work has shown that when two bats compete for a single prey item in a relatively open environment, one of the bats may go silent for extended periods of time, which can serve to minimize sonar interference between conspecifics. Additionally, pairs of big brown bats have been shown to adjust frequency characteristics of their vocalizations to avoid acoustic interference in echo processing. In this study, we extended previous work by examining how the presence of conspecifics <i>and</i> environmental clutter influence the bat's echolocation behavior. By recording multichannel audio and video data of bats engaged in insect capture in open and cluttered spaces, we quantified the bats' vocal and flight behaviors. Big brown bats flew individually and in pairs in an open and cluttered room, and the results of this study shed light on the different strategies that this species employs to negotiate a complex and dynamic environment.",

This issue can be circumvented for multisite data using design‐based inference.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    These points are illustrated by example – our plant abundances were found to violate the implicit\n                    P\n                    oisson assumption of\n                    CATS\n                    , but a negative binomial regression had much improved fit, and our model was extended to multisite data in order to directly model the environment–trait interaction. Violations of the\n                    P\n                    oisson assumption were strong and accounting for them qualitatively changed results, presumably because larger counts had undue influence when overdispersion had not been accounted for. We advise that future\n                    CATS\n                    analysts routinely check for overdispersion and account for it if present.",

Thus, bat populations take a relatively long time to recover from increased mortality rates, and monitoring schemes should cover long time periods. In this work, we analyzed the population trajectories of two bat species, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis myotis, the most numerous in five caves in southern Poland, which are known as important bat hibernacula on a continental scale. Data were collected by regular counts in 1985–2020, depending on the particular cave; in addition, previous data on the number of hibernating bats in these caves, available since 1951, were taken from existing publications. We analyzed time-series data using average locality indices and TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data) methods, and both produced similar results. Generally, the populations of the two studied bat species showed recent increasing trends, especially visible as an effect of recovery after years of decline. The situation recorded in southern Poland is very similar to that described in other places in Europe, where recoveries of bat populations have also been observed in the last decades. Although it is difficult to present results from formal analyses, because of the lack of good data, at least some factors—less exposure to contaminants (pesticides, heavy metals), improving food availability due to climate change, and a lower predation rate (including human pressure), both in the breeding season and during wintering—positively affected both species.",

With an expected higher copulation rate, harem males may deplete seminal fluids or increase epididymal sperm maturation, generating poor sperm quality. In a first study, we reported a higher sperm quality in sneaker males of Carollia perspicillata. To test whether the lower sperm quality observed in harem males was generated by an elevated copulation rate, we temporarily removed males of both social statuses from the colony. We thus assessed status-related changes of sperm quality resulting from sexual abstinence. Moreover, released from territory and female guarding, harem males were expected to show a reduction in somatic costs. On the basis of sperm competition models, we predicted a higher resource investment in the ejaculate with the reduction of pre-copulatory efforts. In line with our predictions, sperm quality of harem males improved significantly in contrast to sneaker males, whose sperm quality did not change. Without an increase in ejaculate lipid peroxidation, our results also provide evidence that the duration of sexual abstinence was not sufficient to generate sperm oxidative damage through senescence. Harem males did not show a reduction in blood lipid peroxidation or in the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione. In line with the maintenance of these somatic costs, harem males did not invest more superoxide dismutase to the ejaculate to maintain sperm quality. Our results suggest that a difference in copulation rate rather than an adaptation to sperm competition provides sneaker males with higher sperm quality in C. perspicillata.",

We examined the distributions of Myotis lucifugus (little brown myotis), Myotis septentrionalis (northern long-eared myotis), and Perimyotis subflavus (tri-colored bat) in eastern Nebraska by setting acoustic detectors for a single night at 105 sites in wooded habitats during summers of 2012 and 2014. We compared 2 methods of determining presence at each site. Results of our analyses are fine-scale distributional maps for these bats and some range extensions from published records. Results for M. septentrionalis and P. subflavus are largely consistent with previous reports. Results for M. lucifugus vary depending on the method of determining presence; however, our preferred method creates a pattern consistent with the known vouchered distribution of this species. The differences between published distributions of these species and distributions based on acoustic detection from our study might result from a lack of extensive netting in many areas of eastern Nebraska, underrepresentation of P. subflavus from mist net surveys in Nebraska, and a recent westward range expansion of P. subflavus and M. septentrionalis in southern Nebraska.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) has claimed the lives of millions of hibernating insectivorous bats in North America. Its etiologic agent, the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans, causes skin lesions that are the hallmark of the disease. The fungal infection is characterized by a white powdery growth on muzzle, ears and wing membranes. While WNS may threaten some species of North American bats with regional extinction, infection in hibernating bats in Europe seems not to be associated with significant mortality. We performed histopathological investigations on biopsy samples of 11 hibernating European bats, originating from 4 different countries, colonized by G. destructans. One additional bat was euthanized to allow thorough examination of multiple strips of its wing membranes. Molecular analyses of touch imprints, swabs and skin samples confirmed that fungal structures were G. destructans. Additionally, archived field notes on hibernacula monitoring data in the Harz Mountains, Germany, over an 11-year period (2000-2011) revealed multiple capture-recapture events of 8 banded bats repeatedly displaying characteristic fungal colonization. Skin lesions of G. destructans-affected hibernating European bats are intriguingly similar to the epidermal lesions described in North American bats. Nevertheless, deep invasion of fungal hyphae into the dermal connective tissue with resulting ulceration like in North American bats was not observed in the biopsy samples of European bats; all lesions found were restricted to the layers of the epidermis and its adnexae. Two bats had mild epidermal cupping erosions as described for North American bats. The possible mechanisms for any difference in outcomes of G. destructans infection in European and North American bats still need to be elucidated.",

Our investigation into intersexual feeding habits of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) revealed different feeding strategies between males and females. Contrary to our predictions, there was no significant difference in time of emergence between males and females, and males and females foraged for equal lengths of time. Temperature influenced length of foraging bouts of both sexes. Female bats exhibited site fidelity within the river valley close to the colonies. Males foraged over larger areas than did females, and spent significantly more time away from the main feeding area than did females. We conclude that the areas in which males foraged were of lower quality or required longer commuting distances, thus requiring males to forage for as long as females.",

Using radio telemetry, we obtained empirical evidence of roosting activity for Little Brown Myotis on the north coast of British Columbia. One non-reproductive adult female and 2 adult male Little Brown Myotis were found to use 4 unique roosting locations in the Prince Rupert area. Three of 4 confirmed roost sites were located in anthropogenic structures, including an industrial warehouse and two 2-story houses. The 4th roost was located in a cedar hedge on a residential property. Roosts were located within 890 to 1140 m of capture sites, which were sited in suitable bat foraging habitat. One male bat re-used the same daytime roost for the duration of the study period, whereas a 2nd male selected 2 different roost locations during the study. Despite the potential limitation of the small sample size of this telemetry study, our findings contribute to the understanding of roosts used by Little Brown Myotis on the north coast of British Columbia, and provide a basis for future directed studies and conservation efforts.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary Glossophagine nectar-feeding bats exploit ﬂowers while hovering in front of them. Aerodynamic theory predicts that power output for hovering ﬂight in Glossophaga soricina is 2.6 times higher than during horizontal ﬂight. We tested this prediction by measuring rates of gas exchange during hoverfeeding. Five individuals of Glossophaga soricina (mean mass 11.7 g) were trained to feed from a nectar dispenser designed as a ﬂow-through respirometry mask. Single hover-feeding events lasted for up to 4.5 s. Measured rates of .gas excha.nge varied as a function of hovering duration. VO2 and VCO2 during short hovering events (up to 1 s) were 20.5±6.7 ml g−1 h−1 (N=55) and 21.6±5.6 ml g−1 h−1 (N=39) (means ± S.D.), respectively. These values are in the range of a previous estimate of the metabolic power input for level forward ﬂight (23.8 ml O2 g−1 h−1). However, during hovering events lasting longer than 3 s, oxygen uptake was only 16.7±3.5 ml g−1 h−1 (N=73), which is only 70 % of the value expected for forward ﬂight. Thus, bats reduced their rate of oxygen uptake during longer periods of hovering compared with level forward ﬂight. This result is in contrast to the predicted hovering cost derived from aerodynamic theory. The exact metabolic power input during hovering remains uncertain. During longer hovering events, bats were probably not in respiratory steady state, as indicated by the deviation of the respiratory exchange ratio from the expected value of 1 (oxidization of nectar sugar) to the measured value of 0.8.",

Since the first cases were recorded, WNS has spread rapidly across North America and is now confirmed or suspected in 40 US states and seven Canadian provinces. Often, the presence of P. destructans is detected in a cave or hibernaculum before signs of WNS manifest in the resident bat population, making presence of the fungus a more reliable assessment of potential epidemic spread than expansion of manifested WNS. An analysis of 43 cave internal climates across the state of Texas revealed a pattern of thermal suitability for P. destructans that correlated significantly with landscape (elevation, lithology) and external climate (mean surface temperature and precipitation). We generated a predictive model to assess the potential spread of P. destructans through Texas karst systems based on external features that correlate with suitable internal climates for fungal growth. Applications of this model to external climatic variables from 2019 showed seasonally varying patterns of suitability for fungal growth in select regions of Texas karst systems. Results from these surveys and models showed that internal climates of Texas caves are likely able to sustain the growth of P. destructans and could cause disease and resulting declines in Texas bats, and act as stepping-stones for the fungus, allowing it to travel southward into Mexican and Central American cave systems. The resulting work will inform researchers and natural resource managers of areas of significant concern to monitor for the spread of WNS.",

Microsatellite loci were developed for the taxonomic and population genetic assessment of the Australian complex of this species. Of the 33 primer sets designed for this research, seven (21%) were deemed suitably polymorphic for population-level analyses of the Australian taxa, with ﬁve (71%) of these loci revealing moderate to high levels of polymorphism (PIC = 0.56 to 0.91). The cross-taxa utility of the M. schreibersii microsatellite markers was assessed in the microbat (Chiroptera) family Miniopteridae. Sub-species and species covering the Miniopteridae’s global distribution (with the exception of the Middle East) were selected, numbering 25 taxa in total. Ampliﬁcation was successful for 26 loci, of which 20 (77%) were polymorphic. High cross-taxa utility of markers was observed with ampliﬁcation achieved for all taxa for between four (20%) and 20 (100%) loci, and polymorphism was considered moderate to high (PIC = 0.47–0.91) for 12 (60%) of these loci. The high cross-taxa utility of the microsatellites reported herein reveal versatile and cost-effective molecular markers, contributing an important genetic resource for the research and conservation of Miniopteridae species worldwide.",

A total of 14 370 prey items were brought home by 986 cats living in 618 households. Mammals made up 69% of the items, birds 24%, amphibians 4%, reptiles 1%, ﬁsh <1%, invertebrates 1% and unidentiﬁed items 1%. A minimum of 44 species of wild bird, 20 species of wild mammal, four species of reptile and three species of amphibian were recorded. 2. Of a sample of 696 individual cats, 634 (91%) brought home at least one item and the back-transformed mean number of items brought home was 11.3 (95% CI 10.4–12.2). The back-transformed means and number of cats retrieving at least one item from each prey group were: 8.1 (7.4–8.9) mammals for 547 (79%) cats, 4.1 (3.8–4.5) birds for 506 (73%) cats, 2.6 (2.2–3.0) herpetofauna for 145 (21%) cats and 2.2 (1.8–2.7) other items for 98 (14%) cats. 3. The number of birds and herpetofauna brought home per cat was signiﬁcantly lower in households that provided food for birds. The number of bird species brought home was greater in households providing bird food. The number of birds and herpetofauna brought home per cat was negatively related to the age and condition of the cat. The number of mammals brought home per cat was signiﬁcantly lower when cats were equipped with bells and when they were kept indoors at night. The number of herpetofauna brought home was signiﬁcantly greater when cats were kept in at night. 4. Based on the proportion of cats bringing home at least one prey item and the backtransformed means, a British population of approximately 9 million cats was estimated to have brought home in the order of 92 (85–100) million prey items in the period of this survey, including 57 (52–63) million mammals, 27 (25–29) million birds and 5 (4–6) million reptiles and amphibians. 5. An experimental approach should be taken to investigate the factors found by this descriptive survey to inﬂuence the numbers of prey brought home by cats. In particular, investigation of potential management practices that could reduce the numbers of wild animals killed and brought home by cats will be useful for wildlife conservation, particularly in suburban areas.",

            "abstractNote": "Molecular approaches to calculate effective population size estimates (Ne) are increasingly used as an alternative to long-term demographic monitoring of wildlife populations. However, the complex ecology of most long-lived species and the consequent uncertainties in model assumptions means that effective population size estimates are often imprecise. Although methods exist to incorporate age structure into Ne estimations for long-lived species with overlapping generations, they are rarely used owing to the lack of relevant information for most wild populations. Here, we performed a case study on an elusive woodland bat, Myotis bechsteinii, to compare the use of the parentage assignment Ne estimator (EPA) with the more commonly used linkage disequilibrium (LD) Ne estimator in detecting long-term population trends, and assessed the impacts of deploying different overall sample sizes. We used genotypic data from a previously published study, and simulated 48 contrasting demographic scenarios over 150 years using the life history characteristics of this species The LD method strongly outperformed the EPA method. As expected, smaller sample sizes resulted in a reduced ability to detect population trends. Nevertheless, even the smallest sample size tested (n = 30) could detect important changes (60%–80% decline) with the LD method. These results demonstrate that genetic approaches can be an effective way to monitor long-lived species, such as bats, provided that they are undertaken over multiple decades.",

Libraries of echolocation calls provide huge potential resources for bat species identifications, ecological studies and conservation surveys. Here, the echolocation calls of two morphologically similar bat species (Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus fuliginosus) were recorded and described in order to characterize vocal signatures for field identification in China. Both M. magnater and M. fuliginosus emitted short frequency modulated echolocation calls with narrow bandwidths. Each call of the former species included two harmonics, with the first harmonic being the strongest, whereas calls of the latter species normally contained one harmonic. Although call durations were similar between the two species, there were significant differences in start, end and peak frequencies between M. magnater and M. fuliginous. The results showed that 92.3% of all calls recorded in China were attributed to the correct species based on spectral features of echolocation calls. We concluded that echolocation calls are valuable characters for the identification of morphologically similar bat species.",

The results indicated that R. pusillus (including calidus, parcus, and szechuanus) in the continental region and Hainan Island of China and “R. cornutus” in Japan are morphologically divergent species. Rhinolophus cornutus should be further split into R. cornutus (including orii, pumilus, and miyakonis) in the main islands of Japan, the Amami and Okinawa Group of the central Ryukyu Archipelago, and Miyako Group of the southern Ryukyus; and R. perditus and R. imaizumii from the Yaeyama Group in the southern Ryukyus. Rhinolophus monoceros from Taiwan is morphologically more similar to species in Japan than to R. pusillus. In addition to R. pusillus, another form that is morphologically similar to species in Japan was recognized from Langzhong in Sichuan Province; this may represent an undescribed species, and further examination is necessary to determine its taxonomic status. Specimens from Guang’an in Sichuan Province, China, are also different from the others, and are characterized by the smallest skull size. Although further studies are required, these specimens were tentatively identified as R. subbadius.",

Clarifying the relative roles of each process is a long-­standing research goal in evolutionary biology. Acoustic signals of bats are a phenotypic characteristic that plays an important role in social organization and species recognition. We extensively sampled the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) throughout China and Vietnam and reconstructed a species phylogeny to better understand the patterns and causes of the geographic variation of acoustic signals. Our results showed that the resting frequency (RF) of calls varied with latitude, sex, and distance among different colony locations. RF differences were not correlated with genetic distance (based on only one nuclear locus and the mitochondrial locus), climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitable water), or body size, although differences in calls increased with distance among various populations. This suggests that cultural drift may play more important roles than genetic drift and acoustic adaptation in shaping acoustic differences within regions in R. sinicus.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Kaeng Khoi virus (KKV), which belongs to the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Perbunyaviridae, was originally isolated from the brain tissue of bats and may cause infection in humans. In this study, the KKV strain WDBC1403 was isolated from bat ﬂies (Eucampsipoda sundaica), ectoparasites of the bat Rousettus leschenaultia, collected from Yunnan Province of China at the Sino-Burmese border.\nMethods and Results: The bat ﬂy specimens were ground and inoculated in culture cells. The WDBC1403 strain was shown to induce cytopathic effects in Vero, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), and Tb1Lu cells, but not in C6/36 cells; however, viral gene ampliﬁcation was detected in the supernatants of C6/36 cells. Using electron microscopy, the virus was determined to be spherical, enveloped, and 80–90 nm in diameter; it was also shown to form plaques in BHK-21 cells and the titer reached 1 · 106.57 plaque-forming units/mL 24 h after infection. The phylogenetic analysis showed that WDBC1403 is a KKV strain, but is independent of the original KKV strain (PSC-19). Viral genome analysis revealed that the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the S, M, and L segments of WDBC1403 with PSC-19 were 88.2% and 96.1%, 76.7% and 85.0%, and 78.3% and 88.9%, respectively. Two amino acids were removed at the end of the open reading frame of the M segment, and 47 nucleotides were removed in the 3¢-untranslated region of the M segment of the WDBC1403 strain compared with the PSC-19 strain.\nConclusions: The WDBC1403 strain is a highly divergent KKV strain, suggesting that there are a variety of KKV strains that exhibit molecular differences. Moreover, because of the large variations in nucleotide and amino acid sequence in the M segment, which encodes an important membrane protein, further research on antigenicity and pathogenicity in humans and animals is needed.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: The gut microbiota is closely linked to host development, diet and health and is inﬂuenced by both the host and the environment. Although many studies have focused on the dynamics of the gut microbiota during development in captive animals, few studies have focused on the dynamics of the gut microbiota during development in wild animals, especially for the order Chiroptera.\nMethods: In this study, we characterized the gut microbiota of the wild Asian particolored bat (Vespertilio sinensis) from 1 day to 6 weeks after birth. We explored the changes in their gut microbial community compositions, examined possible inﬂuencing factors, and predicted the feeding transition period.\nResults: The gut microbiota changed during the development of V. sinensis. The alpha diversity of the bats’ gut microbiota gradually increased but did not change signiﬁcantly from the 1st day to the 4th week after birth; however, the alpha diversity decreased signiﬁcantly in week 5, then stabilized. The beta diversity differed slightly in weeks 4–6. In week 4, the fecal samples showed the highest diversity in bacterial community composition. Thus, we predicted that the potential feeding transition period for V. sinensis may occur during week 4. Redundancy analysis showed that age and body mass index signiﬁcantly affected the compositional changes of the gut microbiota in Asian particolored bats.\nConclusion: The gut microbiota changed during the development of V. sinensis. We suggest that changes in the alpha and beta diversity during week 4 after birth indicate a potential feeding transition, highlighting the importance of diet in the gut microbiota during the development of V. sinensis.",

Bats under stressful conditions, for example when confronted by a predator, will emit aggressive social calls. The presentation of aggressive social calls, including distress calls (DCs), is known to increase heart rate (fH), but how this change in fH is related to the bat’s sound perception and how this evokes behaviors such as the fear response is unknown. Herein, we show that the perception of a distress context induces freezing behavior as a fear response in bats. We found that bats responded by freezing and displayed increased fH when they were presented with a conspecific donor bat in a distress situation evoked by gentle poking with a cotton swab. In addition, when we presented two types of auditory oddball paradigms with different probabilities of DCs and echolocation calls (ECs), the bats’ fH increased when DCs were presented as deviant or control stimuli within standard ECs but did not increase when DCs were presented as standard stimuli. These results suggest that the situational context created by the frequency of sound presentation, rather than simply a single sound feature, induces fH increases and freezing as fear responses in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Silene alba\n, a perennial, dioecious plant, produces flowers that open in the evening and can remain open and receptive to pollination for up to 5 d, though in hot and dry conditions the flowers will wilt during the day only to reopen night after night. In the field, it is visited by two different kinds of pollinators with differential success: moths visit the flowers at night, and their movements result in broad pollen dispersal and large seed production, whereas bees, wasps, and flies visit the flowers in the mornings and have decreased pollination effectiveness. However, this differential success may be due to a decrease in stigmatic receptivity soon after the flowers open. We performed controlled pollinations to determine the effect of stigma age on pollen germination and seed set. We pollinated flowers at 12‐h intervals up to 120 h and divided these into two sets: from one set, we removed stigmas 24 h after pollination to examine percentage of pollen germination. The second set of flowers was allowed to produce fruits, and the seeds were counted and weighed. Pollen germination declined significantly with stigma age, but there was no significant effect of stigma age at pollination on the number or mass of resulting seeds. Thus, the decreased pollination success of bees is not due to a decrease in stigmatic receptivity but is most likely a result of pollinator inefficiency.",

It re-uses design and functionality of the basic R functions just as the underlying conceptual tools extend the classical models. Both hurdle and zeroinﬂated model, are able to incorporate over-dispersion and excess zeros—two problems that typically occur in count data sets in economics and the social sciences—better than their classical counterparts. Using cross-section data on the demand for medical care, it is illustrated how the classical as well as the zero-augmented models can be ﬁtted, inspected and tested in practice.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat wing morphology is considered in relation to flight performance and flight behaviour to clarify the functional basis for eco-morphological correlations in flying animals. Bivariate correlations are presented between wing dimensions and body mass for a range of bat families and feeding classes, and principal-components analysis is used to measure overall size, wing size and wing shape. The principal components representing wing size and wing shape (as opposed to overall size) are interpreted as being equivalent to wing loading and to aspect ratio. Relative length and area of the hand-wing or wingtip are determined independently of wing size, and are used to derive a wingtip shape index, which measures the degree of roundedness or pointedness of the wingtip. The optimal wing form for bats adapted for different modes of flight is predicted by means of mechanical and aerodynamic models. We identify and model aspects of performance likely to influence flight adaptation significantly; these include selective pressures for economic forward flight (low energy per unit time or per unit distance (equal to cost of transport)), for flight at high or low speeds, for hovering, and for turning. \"Turning performance is measured by two quantities: manoeuvrability, referring to the minimum space required for a turn at a given speed; and agility, relating to the rate at which a turn can be initiated. High flight speed correlates with high wing loading, good manoeuvrability is favoured by low wing loading, and turning agility should be associated with fast flight and with high wing loading. Other factors influencing wing adaptations, such as migration, flying with a foetus or young or carrying loads in flight (all of which favour large wing area), flight in cluttered environments (short wings) and modes of landing, are identified. The mechanical predictions are cast into a size-independent principal-components form, and are related to the morphology and the observed flight behaviour of different species and families of bats. In this way we provide a broadly based functional interpretation of the selective forces that influence wing morphology in bats. Measured flight speeds in bats permit testing of these predictions. Comparison of open-field free-flight speeds with morphology confirms that speed correlates with mass, wing loading and wingtip proportions as expected; there is no direct relation between speed and aspect ratio. Some adaptive trends in bat wing morphology are clear from this analysis. Insectivores hunt in a range of different ways, which are reflected in their morphology. Bats hawking high-flying insects have small, pointed wings which give good agility, high flight speeds and low cost of transport. Bats hunting for insects among vegetation, and perhaps gleaning, have very short and rounded wingtips, and often relatively short, broad wings, giving good manoeuvrability at low flight speeds. Many insectivorous species forage by ‘ flycatching ’ (perching while seeking prey) and have somewhat similar morphology to gleaners. Insectivorous species foraging in more open habitats usually have slightly longer wings, and hence lower cost of transport. Piscivores forage over open stretches of water, and have very long wings giving low flight power and cost of transport, and unusually long, rounded tips for control and stability in flight. Carnivores must carry heavy loads, and thus have relatively large wing areas; their foraging strategies consist of perching, hunting and gleaning, and wing structure is similar to that of insectivorous species with similar behaviour. Perching and hovering nectarivores both have a relatively small wing area: this surprising result may result from environmental pressure for a short wingspan or from the advantage of high speed during commuting flights; the large wingtips of these bats are valuable for lift generation in slow flight. The relation between flight morphology (as an indicator of flight behaviour) and echolocation is considered. It is demonstrated that adaptive trends in wing adaptations are predictably and closely paralleled by echolocation call structure, owing to the joint constraints of flying and locating food in different ways. Pressures on flight morphology depend also on size, with most aspects of performance favouring smaller animals. Power rises rapidly as mass increases; in smaller bats the available energy margin is greater than in larger species, and they may have a more generalized repertoire of flight behaviour. Trophic pressures related to feeding strategy and behaviour are also important, and may restrict the size ranges of different feeding classes: insectivores and primary nectarivores must be relatively small, carnivores and frugivores somewhat larger. The relation of these results to bat community ecology is considered, as our predictions may be tested through comparisons between comparable, sympatric species. Our mechanical predictions apply to all bats and to all kinds of bat communities, but other factors (for example echolocation) may also contribute to specialization in feeding or behaviour, and species separation may not be determined solely by wing morphology or flight behaviour. None the less, we believe that our approach, of identifying functional correlates of bat flight behaviour and identifying these with morphological adaptations, clarifies the eco-morphological relationships of bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The bat fauna of arid regions is still poorly studied mostly due to a lack of interest in areas with low species richness and a low number of threatened species. In this study, we reviewed the status of bat diversity in the arid parts of southern Africa, with the aim of setting up a baseline for future work. In particular, we described species richness patterns across four arid zones within the region (Namib Desert, Kalahari, Nama Karoo and Succulent Karoo), exploring abiotic gradients and local landscape structure. Additionally, we examined bat functional groups in this region and compared them with those of three other arid regions of the world to identify potential similarities and diﬀerences. The southern African arid region hosted 17 bat species, representing eight families, of which three are endemic to the region (Rhinolophus denti, Laephotis namibensis and Cistugo seabrae) and one is vagrant (the fruit bat Eidolon helvum). Species richness varied spatially within this arid region, being highest in the drier but topographically heterogeneous Namib Desert, probably as a result of roost availability. With regards to functional groups, the southern African arid region had few bat species adapted to foraging in open spaces, particularly when compared with the neighbouring savannahs. Drawing from this study, we suggest that: a) despite species richness decreasing with increasing aridity at the sub-continental scale, at a more local scale landscape features (e.g. habitat structure) might be more relevant than aridity in determining bat species richness; and b) an unknown factor, possibly patterns of temperature limiting the availability of insects ﬂying high above the ground, restricted the diversity of the open air foragers throughout the region. We highlight additional areas of research worth investigation.",

Whereas M. mystacinus is present across the whole distribution area known for the species complex, , it seems that -according to the present sampling information- the species M. alacathoe is really not found in the Central Pyrenees, Sistema Central, Sistema Ibérico Sur and Sierras Béticas mountain massifs. Despite being sympatric in several localities, M. mystacinus reaches higher altitudes than M. alcathoe.",

Where similar species rely on similar resources in the same foraging habitat, they are likely to interact. This study addresses the trophic niche of the Northern European trawling bat species Myotis dasycneme (Boie, 1825) and Myotis daubentonii (Kuhl, 1817), occurring in the same habitat, and possible interactions or differences within their dietary behaviour. Dietary data of both species were analysed to draw conclusions on their ecology, possible dietary overlap, hints for coexistence mechanisms and community structure. In this study, M. dasycneme and M. daubentonii fed mainly on Chironomidae (M. dasycneme: 44.4%; M. daubentonii: 32.8%) and Trichoptera (M. dasycneme: 20.4%; M. daubentonii: 22.2%), showing a high trophic niche overlap and similar niche breadth. Nevertheless, there were differences in the diet of the two species concerning the predation of chironomids. Differences also occur regarding the prey types, referring to the terrestrial or aquatic life-cycle of prey groups. This could be evidence for different foraging habitats and a spatial segregation of both species. High resource abundance is also likely to allow the coexistence of both species within the same hunting habitat.",

The recordings were made in Kenya during 2013-2018, using Pettersson D500X and D1000X real time, full spectrum bat detectors. All species used highintensity constant-frequency echolocation of high duty-cycle. Most of them separate clearly in the constant-frequency component of the echolocation calls and can be recognized based on that feature alone. This study provides the first description of the echolocation calls of D. camerunensis, whereas those of H. beatus, H. ruber, and C. percivali from Kenya are also described for the first time. Additionally, call frequencies for some of these species differ from those of other parts of their range, demonstrating the need for collection and publication of more local call libraries from tropical regions.",

            "abstractNote": "A study on the occurrence and abundance of fruit bats (Pteropodidae) was done in two conservation areas in North Cotabato, Philippines: Portion of the Mt. Apo National Park ; Balabag, Kidapawan City and Cotabato Provincial Forest and Ecotourism Park (CPFEP), Amas, Kidapawan City. Seven species were recorded in CPFEP and six were noted in Balabag area identified from 449 individuals captured. Two species (Eonycteris spelaea and Rousettus amplexicaudatus) were unique to CPFEP while one (Ptenochirus minor) was found only in Balabag area. A total of eight species were recorded when accounting the species found in two areas in which, three are endemic to the country namely Haplonycteris fischeri, Ptenochirus jagori, and P. minor. Of these endemics, the first two were noted in CPFEP while all were found in Balabag area. More than half of the bats captured were Cynopterus brachyotis hence, considered as the most common species. Remarkable finding was the presence of Megaerops wetmorei, a threatened species, to have found in a new altitudinal record. Considering the importance of fruit bats in regenerating forest, urgent conservation measures are highly recommended.",
