            "abstractNote": "Interaural intensity disparities (IIDs), the cues all animals use to localize high frequency sounds, are initially processed in the lateral superior olive (LSO) by a subtractive process where inputs from one ear excite and inputs from the other ear inhibit LSO neurons. Such cells are called excitatory-inhibitory (EI) neurons and are prominent not only in the LSO but also in higher nuclei, which include the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) and inferior colliculus (IC). The IC is of particular interest since its EI cells receive diverse innervation patterns from a large number of lower nuclei, which include the DNLLs and LSOs, and thus comprise a population with diverse binaural properties. The ﬁrst part of this review focuses on the circuits that create EI cells in the LSO, DNLL and IC. The second section then turns to the responses evoked by dynamic IIDs that change over time, as with multiple sounds that emanate from different regions of space or moving sound sources. I show that many EI neurons in the IC respond to dynamic IIDs in ways that are not predictable from their responses to static IIDs, IIDs presented one at a time. In the ﬁnal section, results from in vivo whole cell recording in the IC are presented and address the connectional basis for the responsiveness to dynamic IIDs. The principal conclusion is that EI cells comprise a diverse population. The diversity is created by the particular set of inputs each EI type receives and is expressed in the differences in the responses to dynamic IIDs that are generated by those inputs. These results show that the construction of EI neurons in the IC imparts features that not only encode the location of an individual sound source, but also that allow animals to determine the direction of a moving sound and to focus and localize a single sound in midst of many sounds, as typically occurs in the daily lives of all animals.",

The studies were conducted on bats and dealt with mechanisms that enable the population of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) to respond selectively to the variety of signals bats emit for both communication and echolocation. The ﬁrst section is concerned with how neurons in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL), the nucleus ventral to the IC, respond to species-speciﬁc signals and how they compare to responses of IC neurons evoked by the same signals. Those studies showed that DNLL neurons have no sideband inhibition and their responses are determined by excitation. In contrast, inhibition dominates in the IC where it carves out highly selective discharge properties. Those studies, in turn, raised questions about the quantitative features of inhibition that could only be answered with more sophisticated techniques. In the second section, results from analyses with spectrotemporal receptive ﬁelds (STRFs) are presented, and in the ﬁnal section I show data derived from in vivo whole cell recordings that illustrate how features of inhibition interact with excitation to generate directionality selective responses in the IC.",

The importance of reliable information in this process is demonstrated using the Park’s mammalian diversity. Opportunities and constraints to engage the local communities in conservation management planning and implementation are reviewed. The spatial element in protected area management planning is stressed; in some areas strict preservation management regimes are needed to conserve critical biodiversity values while in other areas conservation benefits could be gained from engaging local communities in resource management. Pragmatic conservation management planning decisions address identified threats, to be resolved by re-demarcation of boundaries, resettlement of people, and community-based conservation initiatives. These should result in a more viable Park as well as provide more secure livelihood conditions for the people elsewhere. This case study is put in the context of the wider conservation management debate.",

            "abstractNote": "Human habitation in deserts can create rich novel resources that may be used by native desert species. However, at night such resources may lose attractiveness when they are in artiﬁcially lit areas. For bats, attraction to such manmade habitats might be species speciﬁc. In an isolated village in the Negev desert that is known for its high bat activity we investigated the effects of artiﬁcial lighting on ﬂight behaviour of two aerial insectivorous bat species: Pipistrellus kuhlii, a nondesert synanthropic bat, common in urban environments and Eptesicus bottae, a desert-dwelling species. Using an acoustic tracking system we reconstructed ﬂight trajectories for bats that ﬂew under artiﬁcial lights [Light treatment (L)] versus in natural darkness [Dark treatment (D)]. Under L both P. kuhlii and E. bottae ﬂew signiﬁcantly faster than under D. Under L, P. kuhlii also ﬂew at signiﬁcantly lower altitude (i.e. away from a ﬂoodlight) than under D. Whereas P. kuhlii foraged both in L and D, E. bottae only foraged in D. In L, activity of E. bottae decreased and it merely transited the illuminated area at commuting rather than foraging speed. Thus, under artiﬁcially lighted conditions the non-desert synanthropic species may have a competitive advantage over the native desert species and may outcompete it for aerial insect prey. Controlling light pollution in deserts and keeping important foraging sites unlit may reduce the synanthropic species’ competitive advantage over native desert bats.",

Unlike males, female bats in the region are colonial roosters during the summer, which may facilitate ectoparasite transfer. On bats captured at Hayes Cave, NS, there were at least four species of ectoparasites including Myodopsylla insignis (Siphonaptera: Ischnopsyllidae), Spinturnix americanus (Acarina: Spinturnicidae), Cimex adjunctus (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), and a larval Trombiculid mite, Leptotrombidium myotis (Acarina: Trombiculidae). Parasite prevalence was 30.6% and 27.8% for adult M. septentrionalis females and males, respectively, and 25.6% and 16.3% for adult female and male M. lucifugus, respectively. Myodopsylla insignis, S. americanus, C. adjunctus, and L. myotis all represent new host records on both bat species in Nova Scotia, while S. americanus and L. myotis are new species records for the province.",

However, it is not known how sensitive many taxa are to intensification. Sensitive taxa could be used as biotic indicators, to assess changes over time and the effectiveness of policy changes.\n                \n                \n                  We sampled shrews, bats and their prey (beetles, flies and moths) on matched pairs of sites and assessed the response in their abundance to aspects of intensification: increased agrochemical inputs (using abundance on matched organic and conventional cereal fields as a proxy), the switch from hay to silage (using abundance on matched hay and silage fields) and boundary loss (using abundance in the field and near the boundary as a proxy, in cereal and grass separately). We quantified the abundance‐derived sensitivity of the taxa in order to assess their use as biotic indicators.\n                \n                \n                  There was substantial variation in the sensitivity of taxa to the three aspects of intensification. Most estimates (51%) of sensitivity to boundary loss were significant, but only 8% for increased agrochemical inputs and 16% for the switch from hay to silage. Sensitivity to one aspect of intensification was not significantly related to sensitivity to another.\n                \n                \n                  Insectivorous mammals were relatively insensitive to increased agrochemical inputs and the switch from hay to silage, but strongly sensitive to boundary loss.\n                \n                \n                  Taxa with significant sensitivity to increased agrochemical inputs included some Carabidae and Diptera. We found fewer significant differences in abundance between organic and conventional farms than previous workers, probably because we controlled for boundary characteristics, suggesting that the quality of field boundaries is important in influencing biodiversity differences between organic and conventional farms.\n                \n                \n                  The switch from hay to silage had a positive effect on some Coleoptera and Diptera but a substantial negative effect on Hepialidae (Lepidoptera).\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . The recorded sensitivity of taxa to changes in agricultural practices is highly variable. Therefore, the selection of biotic indicator taxa of agricultural intensification is not straightforward. If surveys of biotic indicator taxa are used to assess the effectiveness of changes in agricultural practice, empirical evidence should be used to select suitable taxa.",

Woodlands and humid areas are the most important habitat types to the majority of bat species, whereas the habitats along roads (mostly made in open areas) are less important. Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus noctula, also Eptesicus serotinus, Nyctalus leisleri and Vespertilio murinus proved generalists in using foraging habitats, these species being most frequently recorded. In the humid areas, Nyctalus noctula (25.2%), Myotis sp. (24%) and Pipistrellus nathusii/Pipistrellus kuhlii (22.3%) are the most abundant species. In the woodlands, Nyctalus noctula is the most abundant species (19.5%), followed by Pipistrellus nathusii/Pipistrellus kuhlii (17.6%) and Myotis sp. (11.2%). Along the roads, Nyctalus noctula (44%) and Eptesicus serotinus (13.2%) are the most abundant species. At the streetlamps, Nyctalus noctula (45.4%) and Nyctalus leisleri (12.8%) are the most abundant species.

            "abstractNote": "An introduction is provided to the literature and to issues relating to phylogenetic nomenclature and the PhyloCode, together with a critique of the current Linnaean system of nomenclature. The Linnaean nomenclature ﬁxes taxon names with types, and associates the names with ranks (genus, family, etc.). In phylogenetic nomenclature, names are instead deﬁned with reference to cladistic relationships, and the names are not associated with ranks. We argue that taxon names under the Linnaean system are unclear in meaning and provide unstable group–name associations, notwithstanding whether or not there are agreements on relationships. Furthermore, the Linnaean rank assignments lack justiﬁcation and invite unwarranted comparisons across taxa. On the contrary, the intention of taxon names in phylogenetic nomenclature is clear and stable, and the application of the names will be unambiguous under any given cladistic hypothesis. The extension of the names reﬂects current knowledge of relationships, and will shift as new hypotheses are forwarded. The extension of phylogenetic names is, therefore, clear but is associated to (and thus dependent upon) cladistic hypotheses. Stability in content can be maximized with carefully formulated name deﬁnitions. A phylogenetic nomenclature will shift the focus from discussions of taxon names towards the understanding of relationships. Also, we contend that species should not be recognized as taxonomic units. The term ‘species’ is ambiguous, it mixes several distinct classes of entities, and there is a large gap between most of the actual concepts and the evidence available to identify the entities. Instead, we argue that only clades should be recognized. Among these, it is useful to tag the smallest named clades, which all represent non-overlapping groups. Such taxa – LITUs (Least Inclusive Taxonomic Units) – are distinguished from more inclusive clades by being spelled with lower-case initial letter. In contrast to species, LITUs are conceptually straightforward and are, like other clades, identiﬁed by apomorphies.",

Wing punches (biopsies) of wing or tail membranes are commonly used to collect tissue for DNA analysis, but less invasive techniques are preferable. As such, DNA acquired using buccal and wing swabs or from fecal pellets are increasingly being employed. We compared a dry swabbing technique with the wing biopsy technique for DNA collection. We compared species identiﬁcation between tissue biopsies and wing swabs collected from bats in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, between April and November, 2014, and September and October 2015. Species identiﬁcation was achieved with varying methods of ﬁeld collection and lab processing. DNA was extracted, sequenced, and compared with reference sequences and ﬁeld identiﬁcations. We concluded that wing swabs are an effective way to identify bat species genetically and far less invasive than biopsy techniques. These methods should be considered for genetically sampling bats, especially during seasons when wounds from biopsy are slow to heal. Ó 2017 The Wildlife Society.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Around 40 million years ago DNA transposons began accumulating in an ancestor of bats in the family Vespertilionidae. Since that time, Class II transposons have been continuously reinvading and accumulating in vespertilionid genomes at a rate that is unprecedented in mammals. Miniopterus (Miniopteridae), a genus of long-fingered bats that was recently elevated from Vespertilionidae, is the sister taxon to the vespertilionids and is often used as an outgroup when studying transposable elements in vesper bats. Previous wet-lab techniques failed to identify Helitrons, TcMariners, or hAT transposons in Miniopterus. Limitations of those methods and ambiguous results regarding the distribution of piggyBac transposons left some questions as to the distribution of Class II elements in this group. The recent release of the Miniopterus natalensis genome allows for transposable element discovery with a higher degree of precision.\nResults: Here we analyze the transposable element content of M. natalensis to pinpoint with greater accuracy the taxonomic distribution of Class II transposable elements in bats. These efforts demonstrate that, compared to the vespertilionids, Class II TEs are highly mutated and comprise only a small portion of the M. natalensis genome. Despite the limited Class II content, M. natalensis possesses a limited number of lineage-specific, low copy number piggyBacs and shares several TcMariner families with vespertilionid bats. Multiple efforts to identify Helitrons, one of the major TE components of vesper bat genomes, using de novo repeat identification and structural based searches failed.\nConclusions: These observations combined with previous results inform our understanding of the events leading to the unique Class II element acquisition that characterizes vespertilionids. While it appears that a small number of TcMariner and piggyBac elements were deposited in the ancestral Miniopterus + vespertilionid genome, these elements are not present in M. natalensis genome at high copy number. Instead, this work indicates that the vesper bats alone experienced the expansion of TEs ranging from Helitrons to piggyBacs to hATs.",

Dengue is a consistent health problem in the two Costa Rican communities in which bats were sampled. The high percentage of bats with neutralizing antibodies to dengue virus in these two Costa Rican communities suggests that bats may become infected with dengue virus.

Introduction: The “tintal” is a type of seasonally inundated forest where the dominant species is Haematoxylum campechianum L. Due to its structural characteristics and the conditions of the areas where it develops, it could work as a critical habitat for many animal species. Objective: This work aimed at describing the regional and local diversity of the chiropterofauna inhabiting tintal along different areas in the Southeastern Mexico. Methods: The research was carried out in eight localities with presence of tintal in the states of Campeche and Tabasco, Mexico. In each site, six mist nets were placed during three nights. The observed and expected richness were calculated for each site, as well as the total abundance. Rank-abundance and species accumulation curves were generated. Similarity analyses between localities were performed and correlated with the geographical distance between them. Results: We recorded 25 bat species belonging to five families, where Phyllostomidae was the most represented. Most registered species were insectivorous (44 % of the total), while frugivorous were the most abundant. Frugivorous Artibeus lituratus and A. jamaicensis were the species recorded in a greater number of localities, and Glossophaga soricina was the most abundant. The highest richness of species was registered in Oxpemul (N= 12), while in Las Bodegas we found the lowest (N= 4), although the latter was the third locality with the highest number of individuals. The estimated richness of species for the whole area varied between 29 and 34. The least even assemblages were Las Bodegas and Tres Brazos. The most similar localities in terms of the structure of the assemblages were La Toza and Las Bodegas and, in terms of the species composition, Oxpemul and Atasta. The similarities between the localities were not correlated with geographical proximity. Conclusions: Most of the researched localities were highly anthropized, but the tolerance of several bat species to these landscape modifications has allowed them to make use of such areas. The high abundance of the frugivorous species registered supports that bats may play a key role in the recovery of tree vegetation in altered areas in Southeastern Mexico, and emphasizes the value of the tintal along this area for the conservation of biodiversity.",

The recording effort was 48 nights, by sampling 16 sites three times in 2010. Overall, 2170 call sequences were recorded; 40% of them at the canopy level. Sixteen bat species were identiﬁed, 13 of which occurred at ground level and 14 in the canopy. By ﬁtting generalized linear mixed models for seven species and all calls sequences combined, the effects of stratum, time period, ambient temperature and forest structure on bat-calling activity were assessed. Four species preferred the ground level (Barbastella barbastellus, Eptesicus serotinus, Myotis daubentonii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus). M. bechsteinii was the only species which had a signiﬁcant preference for the canopy level in the pregnancy, lactation and post-lactation period, whereas two further species (M. alcathoe, P. pipistrellus) showed a signiﬁcant canopy preference in at least one period. Therefore, canopy sampling should be undertaken when aiming at monitoring such species for conservation purposes. Populations of certain target species will be underestimated by ground recordings alone.",

Through comparative analyses of bats, we show that multiple mating by males, in the absence of multiple mating by females, has no evolutionary impact on relative brain dimension. In contrast, bat species with promiscuous females have relatively smaller brains than do species with females exhibiting mate fidelity. This pattern may be a consequence of the demonstrated negative evolutionary relationship between investment in testes and investment in brains, both metabolically expensive tissues. These results have implications for understanding the correlated evolution of brains, behaviour and extravagant sexually selected traits.",

            "abstractNote": "We analysed and compared the structure and parameters of the songflight calls of expansive Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus lepidus, that recently colonized Central Europe from the south and east, respectively. Bat calls were recorded mainly in urban areas of Central Europe and the Balkans, including a narrow zone of these species’ recent parapatric or sympatric occurrence (around the Carpathians and the eastern part of the Pannonian Basin). The newly described songflight calls of P. lepidus consist of more elements (median 6), are longer (mean 56.4 ms) and of a higher frequency of maximum energy (mean 25.7 kHz) than those of P. kuhlii (median 3, mean 41.0 ms and mean 14.0 kHz, respectively). This finding provides new evidence that P. lepidus represents a different species, in accordance with results from previous genetic and morphological studies. Reported differences in songflight calls permit the acoustic discrimination of P. kuhlii and P. lepidus, which is not possible based on overlapping parameters of their echolocation calls. Our findings enable distributional and ecological studies of these two species, based on acoustic methods, in the context of their rapid European expansion and the local co-occurrence.",

There was also a permanent or temporary water body near the cave. The palaeoclimate of the region was colder than today, but rather warm compared to more northern parts of Europe, which were strongly affected by the Last Glacial Maximum.",

            "abstractNote": "Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu (REGUA) is a private, protected area inside a remnant of the Atlantic Forest with high biodiversity. Although the bats of the reserve have been sampled for more than two decades, few studies have been published about them. Based on a compilation of data from several surveys, we present an updated list of the bat species there and compare it with surveys from other locations in the Atlantic Forest. From August 1998 to September 2021, at least 194 sampling nights were carried out at REGUA by different research groups from various institutions, totaling 448,092 m2.h of sampling. A total of 4,069 individuals were captured, belonging to 47 species and six families. Additionally, our results indicate that it is possible that some species that occur at REGUA have not been recorded yet. REGUA has the greatest number of bat species known for the Atlantic Forest. This most likely results from the fact that the reserve includes large areas of mature, continuous forest connected with other protected areas in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Another factor contributing to the high diversity of bat species at REGUA is that the area has been intensely sampled for many years. Given that the bat assemblage there appears to be a good proxy to ascertain the ecological patterns of biodiversity in well-preserved forests, we consider REGUA to be an important area for long-term ecological research. The basic knowledge about the ecological interactions of bats with different food resources and zoonotic microorganisms offers a unique opportunity to carry out research in several areas of knowledge, making it possible to address questions about bat assemblage structure, bat-parasite ecology, competition, niche partitioning, and other related studies.",

Fruit size is an important trait that influences feeding behavior of most frugivores, since there is a functional correlation between fruit size and frugivores’ body size. Therefore, size-based preference is fundamental to understand plant-frugivore interactions and seed dispersal. In this sense, we tested the hypothesis of preferential consumption of larger fruits of Piper arboreum by the short-tailed fruit bat Carollia perspicillata in the Brazilian tropical dry forest. Results showed considerable variation in fruit size among and within plants. There was also significant difference in fruit ripening time among plants, which was not related to fruit size. Average size of remaining fruits reduced as they were removed from plants by the bats, which indicates preferential consumption of larger fruits. On the other hand, plant phenology constrained consumption of bigger fruits. Only a small fraction of plant crop was available for consumption each night, regardless of fruit size, which probably coerced bats to feed on smaller fruits as the availability of larger ones decreased. Results suggest that bat preference on fruit size is mediated by plant phenological strategies.",

During May–Jul. 2004 and 2005, we studied bird and bat mortality from collisions with wind turbines at a 102 megawatt, 68-turbine wind farm in the southern Great Plains, Oklahoma, USA. Standardized searches around turbine bases yielded 122 total carcasses of which 92 (75%) were found within 20 m of the turbine bases. We identified 111 carcasses of seven species of bats and 11 carcasses of 6 species of birds. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) comprised 85% of bat carcasses collected. We corrected turbine collision estimates using searcher efficiency trials and a range of removal (i.e., ‘‘scavenging’’) rates reported in the literature. Estimated bat turbine collisions ranged from 1.19–1.71 fatalities/turbine (1.03–1.37/megawatt). These data provide some of the first evidence for a steady rate of collision mortality of Brazilian free-tailed bats at a North American wind farm, most likely due to the site’s proximity (,15 km) to a maternity colony. Spatial analyses indicated no consistent pattern in mortality estimates relative to ground cover or topographic position; but collision mortality was higher at several individual turbines, all of which were located near the heads of eroded ravines.",

            "abstractNote": "Much attention has been paid to the effects of climate change on species’ range reductions and extinctions. There is however surprisingly little information on how climate change driven threat may impact the tree of life and result in loss of phylogenetic diversity (PD). Some plant families and mammalian orders reveal nonrandom extinction patterns, but many other plant families do not. Do these discrepancies reﬂect different speciation histories and does climate induced extinction result in the same discrepancies among different groups? Answers to these questions require representative taxon sampling. Here, we combine phylogenetic analyses, species distribution modeling, and climate change projections on two of the largest plant families in the Cape Floristic Region (Proteaceae and Restionaceae), as well as the second most diverse mammalian order in Southern Africa (Chiroptera), and an herbivorous insect genus (Platypleura) in the family Cicadidae to answer this question. We model current and future species distributions to assess species threat levels over the next 70 years, and then compare projected with random PD survival. Results for these animal and plant clades reveal congruence. PD losses are not signiﬁcantly higher under predicted extinction than under random extinction simulations. So far the evidence suggests that focusing resources on climate threatened species alone may not result in disproportionate beneﬁts for the preservation of evolutionary history.",

To effectively manage this bat species with an archipelago-wide distribution, it is important to determine the population size on each island and connectivity between islands. We used 18 nuclear microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial gene from 339 individuals collected from 1988–2020 to evaluate genetic diversity, population structure and estimate effective population size on the Islands of Hawaiʻi, Maui, Oʻahu, and Kauaʻi. Genetic differentiation occurred between Hawaiʻi and Maui, both of which were differentiated from Oʻahu and Kauaʻi. The population on Maui presents the greatest per-island genetic diversity, consistent with their hypothesized status as the original founding population. A signature of isolation by distance was detected between islands, with contemporary migration analyses indicating limited gene flow in recent generations, and male-biased sex dispersal within Maui. Historical and long-term estimates of genetic effective population sizes were generally larger than contemporary estimates, although estimates of contemporary genetic effective population size lacked upper bounds in confidence intervals for Hawaiʻi and Kauaʻi. Contemporary genetic effective population sizes were smaller on Oʻahu and Maui. We also detected evidence of past bottlenecks on all islands with the exception of Hawaiʻi. Our study provides population-level estimates for the genetic diversity and geographic structure of ‘ōpeʻapeʻa, that could be used by agencies tasked with wildlife conservation in Hawaiʻi.",

Thus, studies describing fragment area at a single spatial scale may fail to capture the amount of forest available from the perspective of individual bat species. In the present paper, we study the influence of forest cover on bats inhabiting a fragmented forest in Mexico, focusing on some of the most common frugivore species:\n              Artibeus jamaicensis\n              ,\n              Carollia\n              spp. (\n              C. brevicauda/C. perspicillata\n              ) and\n              Sturnira\n              spp. (\n              S. lilium/S. ludovici\n              ).\n            \n            \n              We quantified forest cover at scales ranging from 50 to 2000 m, and measured the influence of forest cover on bat capture success, a surrogate for abundance. The three species displayed positive and significant scale‐dependent associations with forest cover. Abundance of\n              A. jamaicensis\n              increased with forest cover measured at scales ranging between 500 and 2000 m, while\n              Carollia\n              spp. responded more strongly to variation in forest cover measured at scales 100–500 m. For\n              Sturnira\n              spp., abundance was a function of presence of creeks near mist‐netting sites, and amount of secondary forest present at a 200 m scale. The observed variation in responses to forest cover can be explained in light of interspecific differences in diet, home range, and body size. Our results illustrate a method for measuring the effect of forest fragmentation on mobile species and suggest that changes in abundance in fragmented landscapes emerge from the interaction between species’ traits and landscape structure.",

We present new information on the genetic variation, geographic distribution, host associations, and potential vectors of these lineages. We conducted field surveys of bats and triatomines in southern Ecuador, a country endemic for Chagas disease, and screened for trypanosomes by microscopy and PCR. We identified parasites at species and genotype levels through phylogenetic approaches based on 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) and cytochrome b (cytb) genes and conducted a comparison of nucleotide diversity of the cytb gene. We document for the first time T. cruzi Tcbat and T. c. marinkellei in Ecuador, expanding their distribution in South America to the western side of the Andes. In addition, we found the triatomines Cavernicola pilosa and Triatoma dispar sharing shelters with bats. The comparisons of nucleotide diversity revealed a higher diversity for T. c. marinkellei than any of the T. c. cruzi genotypes associated with Chagas disease. Findings from this study increased both the number of host species and known geographical ranges of both parasites and suggest potential vectors for these two trypanosomes associated with bats in rural areas of southern Ecuador. The higher nucleotide diversity of T. c. marinkellei supports a long evolutionary relationship between T. cruzi and bats, implying that bats are the original hosts of this important parasite.",

Infections were common (11.6% prevalence), but no other T. cruzi cruzi genotypes were detected. Phylogenetic analyses show an unambiguous association with Brazilian TcBat, but raise questions about the phylogenetic placement of this genotype using the 18S rRNA gene alone. However, analyses with three concatenated genes (18S rRNA, cytb, and H2B) moderately support TcBat as sister to the discrete typing unit (DTU) TcI. We demonstrate that short fragments (>500 bp) of the 18S rRNA gene are useful for identiﬁcation of DTUs of T. cruzi, and provide reliable phylogenetic signal as long as they are analyzed within a matrix with reference taxa containing additional informative genes. TcBat forms a very distinctive monophyletic group that may be recognized as an additional DTU within T. cruzi cruzi.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: GBPs (guanylate binding proteins), an evolutionary ancient protein family, play a key role in the host’s innate immune response against bacterial, parasitic and viral infections. In Humans, seven GBP genes have been described (GBP1-7). Despite the interest these proteins have received over the last years, evolutionary studies have only been performed in primates, Tupaia and rodents. These have shown a pattern of gene gain and loss in each family, indicative of the birth-and-death evolution process.\nResults: In this study, we analysed the evolution of this gene cluster in several bat species, belonging to the Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera sub-orders. Detailed analysis shows a conserved synteny and a gene expansion and loss history. Phylogenetic analysis showed that bats have GBPs 1,2 and 4-6. GBP2 has been lost in several bat families, being present only in Hipposideidae and Pteropodidae. GBPs1, 4 and 5 are present mostly as single-copy genes in all families but have suffered duplication events, particularly in Myotis myotis and Eptesicus fuscus. Most interestingly, we demonstrate that GBP6 duplicated in a Chiroptera ancestor species originating two genes, which we named GBP6a and GBP6b, with different subsequent evolutionary histories. GBP6a underwent several duplication events in all families while GBP6b is present as a single copy gene and has been lost in Pteropodidae, Miniopteridae and Desmodus rotundus, a Phyllostomidae. With 14 and 15 GBP genes, Myotis myotis and Eptesicus fuscus stand out as having far more copies than all other studied bat species. Antagonistically, Pteropodidae have the lowest number of GBP genes in bats.\nConclusion: Bats are important reservoirs of viruses, many of which have become zoonotic diseases in the last decades. Further functional studies on bats GBPs will help elucidate their function, evolutionary history, and the role of bats as virus reservoirs.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Rabies is a fatal infection of the central nervous system primarily transmitted by rabid animal bites. Rabies virus (RABV) circulates through two different epidemiological cycles: terrestrial and aerial, where dogs, foxes or skunks and bats, respectively, act as the most relevant reservoirs and/or vectors. It is widely accepted that insectivorous bats are not important vectors of RABV in Argentina despite the great diversity of bat species and the extensive Argentinean territory.\nMethods: We studied the positivity rate of RABV detection in different areas of the country, and the antigenic and genetic diversity of 99 rabies virus (RABV) strains obtained from 14 species of insectivorous bats collected in Argentina between 1991 and 2008.\nResults: Based on the analysis of bats received for RABV analysis by the National Rabies system of surveillance, the positivity rate of RABV in insectivorous bats ranged from 3.1 to 5.4%, depending on the geographic location. The findings were distributed among an extensive area of the Argentinean territory. The 99 strains of insectivorous bat-related sequences were divided into six distinct lineages associated with Tadarida brasiliensis, Myotis spp, Eptesicus spp, Histiotus montanus, Lasiurus blosseviilli and Lasiurus cinereus. Comparison with RABV sequences obtained from insectivorous bats of the Americas revealed co-circulation of similar genetic variants in several countries. Finally, inter-species transmission, mostly related with Lasiurus species, was demonstrated in 11.8% of the samples.\nConclusions: This study demonstrates the presence of several independent enzootics of rabies in insectivorous bats of Argentina. This information is relevant to identify potential areas at risk for human and animal infection.",

We found an effect of elevation on species richness. As expected, species richness was high in the low elevations; unexpectedly, however, we noted that species richness was highest in the mid-high band, a diversity pattern that has not been previously recorded in bats. We also found an effect of precipitation periods on species richness; in particular, at mid-high elevations, when precipitation was intermediate and highest, we observed a larger number of species. When analyzing data separately by feeding ensemble, we found an effect of elevation on species richness for three ensembles: animalivorous bats were more diverse at the mid-low band, nectarivorous bats were more diverse in the mid-high and high bands, and frugivorous bats were more diverse in the mid-low and low bands. Species richness of frugivorous bats was also affected by precipitation; when rainfall was intermediate and highest, we noted a higher species richness of this ensemble. There was no effect of elevation on species richness for the insectivorous, omnivorous or hematophagous ensemble, nor on the species capture, sex ratio or biomass. Our results not only provide further evidence of the importance of lowland forests as reservoirs of high species diversity, but also highlight the importance of tropical premontane rainforests for the conservation of bat communities given their high species richness, particularly for the nectarivorous and frugivorous ensembles. This is particularly relevant not only because this ecosystem has been heavily affected by land use changes in the Neotropical region, but also because the predicted future decrease of precipitation at this elevation could potentially affect overall species richness and particularly for certain feeding ensembles. Thus, conservation efforts in this life zone are of critical importance for maintaining functional and ecological diversity of bat communities in elevational gradients.",

We found an effect of elevation on the abundance on ten species. We also found a combined effect of altitude and precipitation in two species; for example, Carollia castanea was more abundant at the low altitudinal range and during the high precipitation period, while Sturnira hondurensis was more abundant at the high altitudinal range and during the low precipitation period. We also found an effect of altitude and precipitation on the reproductive status of five bat species. Carollia sowellii and C. castanea showed higher number of reproductive males in the low range and reproductive females in the low altitudinal range during the high precipitation period. We also found a larger number of reproductive males of Sturnira mordax in the mid–high range, while pregnant females were more abundant during the low precipitation period. Our results show altitudinal and temporal patterns of abundance and reproductive phenology that highlight the need for long-term studies of species assemblages along altitudinal gradients. This information is crucial to implement conservation strategies that are species-orientated, promoting habitat protection for a large number of species in altitudinal ranges involved at the specific periods when bat abundance or reproduction is higher.",

This practice causes problems and is undesirable because if related, cryptic, sibling species are encountered later, it may not be possible either to allocate them with certainty to the earlier named species, or to determine them to be something different.\n                \n                \n                  We hypothesised that examination of the instances in which mammalian species were named without preserved types would reveal certain problems that are not unique to them, but are encountered more frequently than when types are preserved. We also thought the Code's stipulation that preserved types are not required in the case of specimens that are no longer ‘extant’ would present special problems hitherto unremarked upon in the literature.\n                \n                \n                  We conducted a review of cases involving putative new species of mammal named since 1900. These were analysed to see what special problems they present and the frequency of such problems.\n                \n                \n                  We found that the Code's waiver of the requirement that a type specimen be deposited in a collection if the specimen is no longer extant presents numerous problems—in particular, that a living‐at‐large type specimen can still be ‘extant’ even if its whereabouts are unknown at certain times and/or it may no longer be alive. Illustrations alone being used to designate type specimens is especially problematic, owing to mammals’ lack of meristic and other obvious distinguishing external characters. Hoaxes, the difficulty in determining that they are hoaxes, and various errors of taxonomic allocation appear to be especially common with names without preserved types. The Code should be revised to require preserved specimens as types for new names. Tissue samples alone for DNA analysis are not ideal for serving this purpose, but should be allowed to meet the requirement.",

Evaluating landscape connectivity in order to identify and protect linkages has therefore become a key challenge in applied ecology and conservation.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    One useful approach to evaluate connectivity is least‐cost path (\n                    LCP\n                    ) analysis. However, several studies have highlighted importance of parameterization with empirical, biologically relevant proxies of factors affecting movements as well as the need to validate the\n                    LCP\n                    model with an independent dataset.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We used\n                    LCP\n                    analysis incorporating quantitative, empirical data about behaviour of the greater horseshoe bat\n                    Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\n                    to build up a model of functional connectivity in relation to landscape connecting features. We then validated the accumulated costs surface from the\n                    LCP\n                    model with two independent datasets; one at an individual level with radiotracking data and one at a population level with acoustic data.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    When defining resistance, we found that the probability of bat presence in a hedgerow is higher when the distance between hedgerows is below 38 m, and decrease rapidly when gaps are larger than 50 m. The\n                    LCP\n                    model was validated by both datasets: the independent acoustic data showed that the probability of bat presence was significantly higher in areas with lower accumulated costs, and the radiotracking data showed that foraging was more likely in areas where accumulated costs were significantly lower.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Through our modelling approach, we recommend a maximum of 38 m (and no more than 50 m) between connecting features around colonies of greater horseshoe bats. Our quantitative study highlights the value of this framework for conservation: results are directly applicable in the field and the framework can be applied to other species sensitive to habitat loss, including other bats. Provided that it is parameterized with empirical, biologically relevant data, this modelling approach can be used for restoring and evaluating green networks in agri‐environmental schemes and management plans.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Foreign Language AbstractRésumé\n            \n              \n                \n                  La fragmentation des habitats et l'isolation résultant des activités humaines ont été reconnues comme une grande menace pour les populations. Evaluer la connectivité paysagère pour identifier et protéger les corridors devient alors un défi crucial en écologie appliquée et en conservation.\n                \n                \n                  La modélisation par les Chemins de Moindre Coût (LCP) est une approche très utilisée pour évaluer la connectivité. Cependant, plusieurs études ont pointé l'importance du choix des paramètres affectant les mouvements (qui doivent correspondre à une réalité biologique mesurée sur le terrain), ainsi que le besoin de valider le modèle de connectivité avec un jeu de données indépendant.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Nous proposons ic un modèle de connectivité fonctionnelle pour le Grand Rhinolophe\n                    Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\n                    . Une analyse par LCP est paramétrée avec des données empiriques et quantitatives en lien avec le déplacement des rhinolophes près des éléments fixes du paysage. Ce modèle a été ensuite validé avec deux jeux de données indépendants, un au niveau individual avec du radio‐pistage et l'autre au niveau populationnel avec des données acoustiques.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  En définissant la résistance sur le terrain, nous trouvons que la probabilité de franchir une discontinunité dans une haie est plus importante quand la trouée est inférieure à 38m, et diminue fortement quand cette distance dépasse 50m. Le modèle LCP est validé par les deux jeux de données : les probabilités de présence des rhinolophes mesurées par l'acoustique et par le radio‐pistage sont plus importantes dans les zones où le coût accumulé de déplacement est significativement plus faible.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthèse et applications\n                    . Selon nos résultats, une distance de trouée maximale de 38m (pas plus que 50m) est recommendée entre les éléments fixes du paysages autour de colonies de mise‐bas de Grand Rhinolophe. Cette approche quantitave permet une application de conservation concrète sur le terrain, transferable à d'autres espèces sensibles à la perte de connectivité, comme les chiroptères. A condition qu'elle soit paramétrée correctement, cette modélisation peut aider à restaurer les connectivités et évaluer les mesures de conservation visant les continuités écologiques.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Through our modelling approach, we recommend a maximum of 38 m (and no more than 50 m) between connecting features around colonies of greater horseshoe bats.

            "abstractNote": "Mormoopidae is an exclusive Neotropical family of bats, distributed from southern Mexico to northeastern Brazil. Possibly due to its endemic distribution and very low occurrence (rarity), descriptions of their reproductive accessory glands (RAGs) are still lacking. Thus, this study aims to characterize the male RAGs of Pteronotus gymnonotus (Mormoopidae: Chiroptera). Results demonstrate that the RAGs of P. gymnonotus is composed of a prostatic complex, comprising two regions (ventral and dorsal prostates); urethral (Littre) glands, a pair of bulbourethral and ampullary glands, with the absence of seminal vesicles. The ventral prostate has an atypical epithelium, due to its holocrine secretion; which contains numerous PAS-positive globular vesicles. The dorsal prostate has a cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium, containing fluid PAS-negative secretion. The ampullary glands present cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium, with secretion varying from granular and PAS-negative to fluid and PAS-positive. Urethral glands are dispersed in the submucosa of the urethra, while the bulbourethral glands are located in the penile root. Both glands have cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium with PAS-positive globular secretion. In conclusion, we propose that the RAGs of P. gymnonotus possibly evolved from a common emballonurid ancestor, shared with the families Phyllostomidae and Nocti­ lionidae, but with the development of an exclusive apomorphy, the ampullary glands.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat caves harbor exceptional populations of insectivorous bats. Those bats play an important role as insect suppressors and produce large quantities of guano, which is essential for maintaining cave ecosystems since entire highly specialized cave biotas may heavily rely on bat guano as their main energy input. Although ecologically relevant, few studies have estimated insect consumption and guano input in Neotropical bat caves. We provide estimates for five bat caves used by Pteronotus gymnonotus and P. personatus (Mormoopidae) in northeastern Brazil. Using a non-invasive automated system, we counted bats, then captured and weighted individuals to estimate insect consumption, and, with collectors and rulers, estimated the amount and speed of guano accumulation in cave sectors. Bat abundance varied between and within caves, up to 158,884 bats, indicating highly dynamic occupation patterns. Insect consumption varied from 0.6 to 2.5 g/bat for P. gymnonotus (~5 to 20% of their body weight) and 0.8 to 2.0 g/bat for P. personatus (~10 to 28% of their body weight). Guano deposition was spatially and temporally heterogeneous (from 0 to 738 g/m2/96h). Some caves showed a 15-cm increase in guano deposits on the cave floor in 7 months. Bulky guano deposits in those caves stressed the bat role as insect suppressors. The present study provides baseline quantitative data on the contributions of bats to cave ecosystems and valuable data for estimates of ecosystem services provided by bats.",
