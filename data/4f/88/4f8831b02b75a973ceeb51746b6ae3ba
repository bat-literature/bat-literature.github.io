            "abstractNote": "Exposure to contaminants is one of the main threats to all living organisms. In this context, bats have been used to indicate environmental contaminants in urban and agricultural environments, since they are extremely sensitive to changes in the ecosystem and easily accumulate waste in their body tissues. Among bats, Sturnira lilium, is a frugivorous species widely distributed and abundant in Brazil that uses an extensive variety of habitats and shelters. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the oxidative state of S. lilium individuals in agricultural and urban areas in southern Brazil. Individuals were sampled in agricultural and urban areas from November 2017 to March 2018 through the mist-net method. Parameters of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activity, non-protein thiols (NPSH), and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) were determined based on liver tissue. A total of 46 individuals were captured, 29 of them in urban areas and 17 in agricultural areas. We found that S. lilium individuals from agricultural areas showed a significant increase in TBARS, NPSH, and SOD activity, compared to individuals from urban areas. The activity of the antioxidant enzyme CAT did not differ. The present findings suggest that the species S. lilium, which are widely distributed and abundant in Brazil in urban and agricultural areas, can usefully be employed in biomonitoring programs. Further studies are to be encouraged to refine our knowledge on the potential DNA damage caused by environmental contamination, as well as identify potential contaminants to bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are poorly understood as a reservoir of multidrug-resistant strains; therefore, the aim of this study was to determine molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus strains isolated from bat species from Poland. A multi-stage analysis based on targeted isolation of drug-resistant strains (selective media with tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin), determination of the phenotypic proﬁle of drug-susceptibility using the disc diffusion method, and ampliﬁcation of DNA fragments surrounding rare restriction sites (ADSRRS-ﬁngerprinting) was used for the isolation and differentiation of strains. The applied strategy ﬁnally allowed identiﬁcation of E. faecalis resistant to at least one antimicrobial in 47.2% of the single-animal group and in 46.9% of the pooled samples of bat’s guano. Out of the 36 distinct isolates, 69% met the criteria of multi-drug resistance, with a dominant combination of resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, and rifampicin. Simultaneously, 41.6% of the strains were high-level aminoglycoside resistant (HLAR). In most strains, phenotypic resistance was reﬂected in the presence of at least one gene encoding resistance to a given drug. Moreover, our research results show that some genes were detected simultaneously in the same strain statistically signiﬁcantly more frequently. This may conﬁrm that the spread of some genes (tetM and ermB or aph (30)-IIIa as well as gelE and aac (60)-Ie-aph (200)-Ia or ant (6)-Ia) is associated with their common occurrence on the same mobile genetic element.",

            "abstractNote": "There is a growing conservation concern about the possible consequences of environmental contamination in the health of bat communities. Most studies on the effects of contaminants in bats have been focused on organic contaminants, and the consequences of bat exposure to metals and metalloids remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of external biological matrices (fur and wing membrane) for the assessment of exposure and bioaccumulation of metals in bats. The concentration of arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, nickel, lead, selenium and zinc was measured in internal organs (liver, heart, brain), internal (bone) and external tissues (wing membrane, fur) collected from bat carcasses of four species (Hypsugo savii, Nyctalus leisleri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus) obtained in windfarm mortality searches. With the exception of zinc (P ¼ 0.223), the results showed signiﬁcant differences between the concentrations of metals in the analyzed tissues for all metals (P < 0.05). Signiﬁcant differences were also found between organs/tissues (P < 0.001), metals (P < 0.001) and a signiﬁcant interaction between organs/tissues and metals was found (P < 0.001). Despite these results, the patterns in terms of metal accumulation were similar for all samples. Depending on the metal, the organ/tissue that showed the highest concentrations varied, but fur and wing had the highest concentrations for most metals. The variability obtained in terms of metal concentrations in different tissues highlights the need to deﬁne standardized methods capable of being applied in monitoring bat populations worldwide. The results indicate that wing membrane and fur, biological matrices that may be collected from living bats, yield reliable results and may be useful for studies on bats ecotoxicology, coupled to a standardized protocol for large-scale investigation of metal accumulation.",

(ii) We performed histological analysis and found more histopathological lesions in detoxiﬁcation organs of WWTW bats. (iii) We calculated hepatosomatic/renalsomatic indices (HSI/RSI) to investigate whole organ effects, and found signiﬁcant increases in organ size at WWTWs. (iv) We quantiﬁed metallothionein 1E (MT1E), using Western Blot immunodetection. Contrary to predictions, we found no signiﬁcant upregulation of MT1E in bats at WWTWs.

The beginning of the sequence (AD 990) was rather wet for more than a century, before becoming progressively drier. After a brief, yet distinct wet period around AD 1170, drier conditions, with a possible shift from C3 to a mixed C3-dominated/C4 type vegetation (2 ‰ lower δ13C values), prevailed for almost half a century before the climate became colder and wetter at the onset of the Little Ice Age, when bats left the cave. The guano-inferred wet and dry intervals from the GM Cave are mirrored by changes in the color and amount of clay accumulated in the cave. They also agree well with reconstructions based on pollen and charcoal from peat bogs and δ13C and δ18O on speleothems from other Romanian sites. Overall, these results indicate that the δ13C of bat guano can provide a sensitive record of the shortterm coupling between local/regional climate and the plant–insect–bat–guano system.",

Within the oceans, coral reef systems have been facing unprecedented mass bleaching episodes, sea turtles worldwide are currently experiencing an epidemic in the form of ﬁbropapilloma, and global phytoplankton populations have declined by 40%. Within the Earth's terrestrial systems, similar phenomena have appeared in the form of colony collapse disorder (CCD) currently devastating honey bee colonies, White Nose Syndrome decimating bat populations, and the chytrid fungus plaguing amphibian populations. On the surface these events appear to be unrelated yet at the root of each phenomenon there appears an underlying threat — pollution. This paper will investigate the commonality of these occurrences as well as investigate the current and potential solutions to the threat.",

            "abstractNote": "Active flight requires the ability to efficiently fuel bursts of costly locomotion while maximizing energy conservation during non-flying times. We took a multi-faceted approach to estimate how fruit-eating bats (Uroderma bilobatum) manage a high-energy lifestyle fueled primarily by fig juice. Miniaturized heart rate telemetry shows that they use a novel, cyclic, bradycardic state that reduces daily energetic expenditure by 10% and counteracts heart rates as high as 900 bpm during flight. Uroderma bilobatum support flight with some of the fastest metabolic incorporation rates and dynamic circulating cortisol in vertebrates. These bats will exchange fat reserves within 24 hr, meaning that they must survive on the food of the day and are at daily risk of starvation. Energetic flexibly in U. bilobatum highlights the fundamental role of ecological pressures on integrative energetic networks and the still poorly understood energetic strategies of animals in the tropics.\n          , \n            To survive, all animals have to balance how much energy they take in and how much they use. They must find enough food to fuel the chemical processes that keep them alive – known as their metabolism – and store leftover fuel to use when food is not available. Bats, for example, have a fast metabolism and powerful flight muscles, which require a lot of energy. Some bat species, such as the tent-making bats, survive on fruit juice, and their food sources are often far apart and difficult to find. These bats are likely to starve if they go without food for more than 24 hours, and therefore need to conserve energy while they are resting.\n            To deal with potential food shortages, bats and other animals can enter a low-energy resting state called torpor. In this state, animals lower their body temperature and slow down their heart rate and metabolism so that they need less energy to stay alive. However, many animals that live in tropical regions, including tent-making bats, cannot enter a state of torpor, as it is too hot to sufficiently lower their body temperature. Until now, scientists did not fully understand how these bats control how much energy they use.\n            Now, O’Mara et al. studied tent-making bats in the wild by attaching small heart rate transmitters to four wild bats, and measured their heartbeats over several days. Since each heartbeat delivers oxygen and fuel to the rest of the body, measuring the bats’ heart rate indicates how much energy they are using. The experiments revealed for the first time that tent-making bats periodically lower their heart rates while resting (to around 200 beats per minute). This reduces the amount of energy they use each day by up to 10%, and helps counteract heart rates that can reach 900 beats per minute when the bats are flying.\n            Overall, these findings show that animals have evolved in various ways to control their use of energy. Future research should use similar technology to continue uncovering how wild animals have adapted to survive in different conditions. This knowledge will help us to understand how life has become so diverse in the tropics and the strategies that animals may use as climates change.",

The Banana Bat, Neoromicia nana speciﬁcally exploits the high abundance of chironomid midge prey available at WWTWs but these populations also have higher levels of non-essential metals (Cd, Cr and Ni) in their tissues than bats foraging at unpolluted sites. Pollutant exposure may elicit primary physiological responses such as DNA damage and haematological changes. We investigated whether pollutant exposure from foraging at WWTWs impacts haematological and genotoxic parameters in N. nana. We compared four measures of haematological/genotoxic damage between N. nana foraging at three WWTWs and two unpolluted sites located in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: DNA damage measured by the Comet assay, total antioxidant capacity as indicated by the FRAP assay, chromosomal aberration indicated by micronuclei formation and blood oxygen capacity based on haematocrits. There was signiﬁcantly higher DNA damage in N. nana at WWTWs than in bats from unpolluted sites, suggesting inadequate repair to double stranded DNA breaks. In addition, WWTW bats had a signiﬁcantly lower antioxidant capacity than bats from unpolluted sites. This suggests that bats at WWTWs may have a diminished capacity to cope with the excess reactive oxidative species (ROS) produced from pollutants such as metals. There was no increase in micronucleus frequency in WWTW bats, indicating that cellular functioning has not yet been disrupted by chemical exposure. Haematocrits, however, were signiﬁcantly higher in WWTW bats, possibly due to erythrocyte production in response to certain pollutants. Thus, effects of pollutant exposure in bats foraging at WWTWs elicit sublethal haematological and genotoxic responses which may pose serious long-term risks. This provides evidence that WWTWs, that are aimed to remove pollutants from the environment, can themselves act as a source of contamination and pose a threat to animals exploiting these habitats.",

            "abstractNote": "Deltamethrin (DTM) is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide highly used by farmers and home users. This pesticide has lipophilic properties that facilitate a high absorption and can cause toxicity in non-target organisms. During foraging, the fruit-eating bats Artibeus lituratus are exposed to pesticides. However, the knowledge of the toxicity of pesticides on the physiology of bats is relatively scarce. This study aimed to check the toxicity of short-term exposure to low concentration of DTM on fruit-eating bat A. lituratus. After seven days of exposure to two doses of DTM (0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg of papaya), the fruit bats showed an increase in the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and hyperglycemia. The liver and pectoral muscle presented oxidative stress. In the liver, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) were increased as well as the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) but in a lesser extent. Yet, total lipids were increased while hepatic glycogen content is reduced. The pectoral muscle showed NO, SOD, CAT, malondialdehyde (MDA), and carbonyl increased protein levels in both concentrations of DTM. All these results show that low doses of DTM can cause hepatic and muscular toxicity and induce changes in carbohydrate metabolism. Physiological changes caused by exposure to DTM in bats may have direct consequences in ﬂight capacity, reproduction, and metabolism of these animals.",
