In 2008–2009, we expanded the knowledge of this species’ feeding ecology by analyzing the diet of a T. bidens population in an Atlantic Forest fragment in southeastern Brazil. Food remains found in day shelters and feeding roosts included insects, birds, mammals and fruits. Insects, Lepidoptera, Blattodea, Coleoptera and Orthoptera, were the main component of the diet. There was a preferential consumption of the soft parts of insects and vertebrates, possibly because these parts are more easily digested and are the most nutritious. This first evidence of fruit consumption is also discussed. This analysis indicates that T. bidens has a more general diet than previously reported.",

Records from 710 mammal species were drawn on a map of North America (from Canada and Alaska to Panama) gridded at 4° latitude-longitude. We evaluated the probable existence of unknown species through three richness estimators (Chao2, ICE, and Jack1), modeled the potential distribution of species, and mapped the predicted pattern of species richness through the number of coexisting potential distributions. The poorest grid cells are in the northern areas, whereas the richest ones are in the southern areas, coinciding with the pattern of collecting points. The average richness of 4° grid cells comprising the Nearctic region was 18 species, and the richest 4° grid cells had 150 species, coinciding with the 26° latitude. From the 406 mammal species of the Nearctic region, 104 are restricted to it, and 305 species situated south of it are not distributed in the region. The map of predicted richness shows the classical latitudinal diversity gradient, with the number of species increasing to the tropics. We conclude that the Nearctic region has a low mammal richness, with a richness pattern corresponding with previously described patterns of endemism, with a boundary situated at 26°–30° latitude.",

The aims of this study were to list species of Phyllostomidae bats in Curió Municipal Natural Park located in the municipality of Paracambi, state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil, and determine possible differences in species richness, abundance and composition between rainy and dry seasons. Sampling was carried out between September 2011 and August 2012 with the use of mist nets. The total sampling effort was 51,840 m2 h, and 745 individuals of 18 bat species were caught. Myotis riparius (Vespertilionidae) was the only non-Phyllostomidae species caught. Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata were the most abundant species. The collector curve did not become stabilized, with 21 ± 2 phyllostomid species being estimated for the park. No significant difference in species richness or change in the community composition was found between seasons; however a higher number of individuals was captured in the rainy season. The occurrence of specie indicator of goodquality habitats (Chrotopterus auritus, Micronycteris microtis and Trachops cirrhosus) and species threatened with extinction (Chiroderma doriae and Dermanura cinerea) indicate that the park is an important forest remnant for the conservation of bats and needs to be monitored.",

For the rest of Ukraine, as for other regions of Europe to the north and the northeast, the species was considered a migratory one. Today, the noctule bat is known in winter for 23 (of 25) administrative provinces of Ukraine, and winter colonies have been recorded in most of them. In Ukraine, N. noctula is a seasonal epilithic species, which hibernates mostly in multi-storey buildings serving as cliff-like structures. The retrospective analysis of bat data from Ukraine and adjacent countries shows that new records refer to the expansion of the species’ winter range, which occurred during the last decades. The border of the winter range of N. noctula in Eastern Europe now lies at least 500–600 km northward than previously assumed. The analysis of the air temperature datasets demonstrates that warming of winters cannot be the only factor determining this process. Mass appearance of high buildings and roosts associated with them is thought to be an important condition driving the expansion.",

This region has been formally recognized as an “Area of Importance for the Conservation of Bats” (AICOM) based on the diversity of species detected in our previous studies. This site in the Yungas forests of northwestern Argentina still maintains an excellent conservation status due to restrictions to human activities involving deforestation and limitations to cattle-raising imposed 50 years ago. A total of 39 species belonging to three orders, namely, Didelphimorphia, Chiroptera and Rodentia, were recorded. The species accumulation curve revealed that our records represent 83–95% of the community, and with high diversity indexes. Several of the genera and species that we recorded from our collection trips have been included in the fauna of Argentina. Our previous studies and the present findings provide new records for the province or significant extensions to previously known distributions of several taxa of small mammals. These results show that the site represents an icon for conservation in such a fragmented and exploited area as the Yungas in Argentina today.",

Data of new records or range extension of species published between 2010 and 2013 were compared among Brazilian biomes. We also utilized a case study in the Paraná State coastal area, southern Brazil, which was considered of low priority for bat inventories but had new records reported recently. The Atlantic Rainforest showed the highest number of papers with new information about bat distribution in Brazil. The number of bat species for this biome reaches 117. In the past 10 years, 11 new records have been reported for the Paraná State coastal area, increasing the bat richness by 33%. Our findings suggest that we do not know sufficiently the bat distribution across the Atlantic Rainforest. In such a hotspot for biodiversity conservation, it may be dangerous to establish low-priority areas for inventories, especially when an almost unique and biased survey method has been used.",

After checking for the presence or absence of bats in trees, we collected a number of variables to describe trees within a lowland sub-Atlantic oak-dominated forest. We modelled the usage of the trees by bats according to the main characteristics of trees (11 quantitative and 13 qualitative variables) with a logistical regression analysis. Our results show that the number of cavities in the tree is the main variable that induces the occupancy by bats. There is a “typical” lowland tree preferred by bats which is a healthy oak tree of large diameter. We finally provide some guidance for woodland managers to maintain bat roosts, including maintaining some trees of large diameter, protecting small areas of old trees with cavities).",

Many studies have assessed the use of ponds by bats. However, most of them have been concentrated in the United States and Europe, while in regions with higher bat diversity the information is scarce. We captured the bat species associated with artificial ponds in a Mexican mountain where water was intubated 25 years ago. We identified and analyzed the bats’ species proportion and sex ratio and evaluated if species richness and abundance were affected by season, mean monthly precipitation, maximum monthly temperature and maximum monthly humidity. We captured 90 bats of seven species (Vespertilionidae), where Myotis melanorhinus Allen 1866 was the most abundant species (37.7%), followed by M. volans Allen 1866 (27.7%), Eptesicus fuscus Beauvois 1796 (22.2%), M. velifer Allen 1890 (5.5%), Corynorhinus mexicana Allen 1916 (3.3%), M. thysanodes Miller 1897 (2.2%) and Idionycteris phyllotis Allen 1916 (1.1%). Species richness and abundance were related to seasonality and maximum monthly temperature and humidity. Overall adult sex ratio was biased towards males. Our results are consistent with previous reports that have showed that artificial ponds play an important role for bats in environments where water availability is scarce.",

We captured an adult male specimen in mist-nets set at ground level in the Caju Private Natural Heritage Reserve, Itaporanga D’Ajuda, Sergipe State, northeastern Brazil. Owing to their similarities in external morphology, D. anderseni may be easily mistaken for Dermanura cinerea. Thus, considering that D. cinerea is one of the most common species in the Atlantic Forest of northeastern Brazil, we are alert for the possibility of misidentified specimens in zoological collections.",

Our results revealed that several characters of the second lower molar (m2), and of the posterior mandible may be used to identify and to diagnose the South American Chiroderma. We also revisited the historical interpretation of homologies of the lower molar cusps of Chiroderma, and propose a revised molar cusp terminology.",

Contrary to previous predictions, we report here the first case of blindness and ocular anomalies in healthy adult echolocating bats. Two anomalous individuals of Carollia perspicillata, two Artibeus planirostris and one Artibeus lituratus were captured in highly human-modified areas (urban and agricultural). One C. perspicillata was totally blind exhibiting completely closed eyelids and the others presented strong corneal opacity in their right eye. Our finding brings new insights about the habitat perception in mammals and suggests an unreported ecological compensation of the sensory system in bats.",

In the present study, we present an acoustic guide to the calls of nine species of bats from Gujarat belonging to families Rhinopomatidae (Rhinopoma hardwickii, Rhinopoma microphyllum), Emballonuridae (Taphozous melanopogon, Taphozous longimanus and Taphozous nudiventris), Rhinolophidaea (Rhinolophus lepidus), Hipposideridae (Hipposideros galeritus) and Vespertilionidae (Scotophilus heathii, Pipistrellus ceylonicus). Discriminant function analysis was used to classify the bat calls to the species level using leave-one-out cross validation. Analysis was carried out separately for constant frequency (CF) calls and frequency-modulated (FM) calls. Bats echolocating with CF calls were classified with 100% success, while in the case of FM calls, the calls were classified with 66.7% accuracy. In species-rich communities, care should be taken while using echolocation calls to identify bats producing FM calls. More such call libraries of bats from other parts of India are needed for non-invasive documentation of chiropteran fauna in different biogeographic zones.",

Although there was no variation in colony size of insectivorous bats, the fruit bat population (around 38,000 individuals) was only recorded in autumn which indicated seasonal migration. Occasional killing of bats, unsustainable guano extraction, and tourism development threaten this major cave for bats in Nepal. The study recommends prioritizing scientiﬁc research and bat friendly cave conservation actions.",

The basic social structure observed in Desmodus was of a ªprincipal colonyº or ªharemº composed of females and their offspring and a few adult males, termed ªresident malesº and a separate group of the other males, termed ªnon-resident malesº. The roosting patterns of Diphylla differed little from those observed in Desmodus, but the hierarchical segregation of non-resident males appeared to be less strict. In both species the non-resident males are accepted into the principal colony when the ambient temperature lowers. This behavior suggests social thermoregulation. Parturition of both species occurred once a year, and most of the births took place in spring or summer. The average duration of palpable pregnancy and lactation was longer in Desmodus than in Diphylla. In both species some lactating females that had lost their young continued suckling the babies of other females. Desmodus is larger in size than Diphylla. This may be related to the size and type of prey; Desmodus preys principally on large mammals and Diphylla preys on birds. We observed female biased sexual dimorphism in Desmodus and isometrical sexes in Diphylla. This may be related to the differential duration of lactation and maternal care periods, as the breeding cycle in Desmodus is longer than in Diphylla. The average time of reaching maturity: epiphysis closure of wing bones, adult weight, scrotal testes, and first pregnancy, as well as the first flight time and the time when males begin to roost apart from the principal colony, were later in Desmodus than in Diphylla. The variation between the two genera for duration of ontogeny and maternal care periods may be related to the learning needs for predation on different types of prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Although there have been several reports on the structures of the lacrimal apparatus of the Chiroptera, there has been very little discussion about its morphological diversity and potential phylogenetic implications. Histological sections were used to document the anatomy of the lacrimal-conducting apparatus (LCA) in representatives of 44 chiropteran genera, including, for the first time members of Taphozous, Nycteris, Macroderma, Lavia, Hipposideros, Lonchophylla, Noctilio, Pteronotus, and Furipterus. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of the bat LCA, the distributions of the LCA features were mapped, using the computer program MacClade, onto the phylogenetic tree of SIMMONS and GEISLER (1998). The lacrimal-conducting apparatus in the Chiroptera ground plan, characterized by a well-developed nasolacrimal duct and a narial nasolacrimal duct opening, is very similar to other eutherians. Nevertheless, several evolutionary transformations have taken place within the Microchiroptera: The nycterids and noctilionoids (phyllostomids + (mormoopids + noctilionids)) are characterized by apomorphic reduction of the LCA. However, there seems to be no correlation between the absence of the LCA and the life style of these bat groups. In rhinopomatids, rhinolophids and some megadermatids, the nasolacrimal duct is truncated, opening in a ventromedial recess of the inferior nasal meatus close to the entrance of the nasopalatine duct and the vomeronasal organ. Similarly, among Nataloids (e. g., Natalus and Thyroptera), the nasolacrimal duct is shorter and opens into the inferior nasal meatus, but it has no connection to the nasopalatine duct. In emballonurids, in which the vomeronasal organ is absent, the nasolacrimal duct opens into the nasopalatine duct (e. g., Taphozous, Saccolaimus) or very close to its nasal entrance (e. g., Coleura, Cormura, Rhynchonycteris).",

Epididymal filling in adult males declined from April to early July. Thereafter epididymal filling sharply increased and the highest median value was reached in the second half of September, i. e., prior to the occupation of the hibernaculum. Highest median epididymal filling in juveniles occurred in the first half of September. During August, September and October epididymal filling of adult males was significantly higher than that of juveniles. In late summer (August/ September) relatively heavy adult males stayed significantly longer in their day roosts and spent significantly less time foraging than in early summer (June/July). The findings suggest that a large proportion of matings in M. daubentonii occurs already in the day roosts within the summer habitat.",

Five hundred and twenty six individuals were examined (197 males and 329 females) in the period December 2001 to May 2003. Throughout the study most males displayed large scrotal testes. Thirty-three males were randomly selected for histological examination at various times throughout the year and were found to have spermatogenic testes. The reproductive characteristics of the females indicated that they were reproductively active mainly during the wet season. Pregnancy occurs at the end of the dry season and parturition in the wet season. Most individuals captured after this season, mainly the females, were sexually immature. Our results suggest a seasonal monoestrous reproductive pattern for the species; however, adult males being fertile throughout the year could suggest polyoestry. Seasonal polyoestry is a possibility. There was, however, no evidence that females had more than one pregnancy per year.",

To examine the impact of landscape structure on the distribution of forest-dwelling bats, we examined the effects of these factors on the distribution and activity patterns of tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subﬂavus) in Nova Scotia, Canada. In Nova Scotia maternity colonies of the tri-colored bat use clumps of Usnea spp. lichen for roosting, typically in mature spruce trees. In 2005 and 2006, we used Anabats to assess tri-colored bat activity at 90 river sites in southwest Nova Scotia. The results of echolocation monitoring indicate that the tri-colored bat occurs within a minimum area of 10,020 km2. The best landscape predictor of the magnitude of tri-colored activity was non-forested land area within commuting distance of survey sites, suggesting that tri-colored bats were less active in landscapes where forests are cleared for agriculture, settlements and timber production. Therefore, this is an example of a forest-associated bat that seems to be negatively impacted by landscape practices that reduce the spatial extent of forests.",

Between late May and early November, the bats occupied abandoned man-made structures in this area. Parturition occurred between late June and mid-July, and juveniles were independent by late August. A. tridens foraged near the roost in a vegetation-rich, cluttered background environment, catching insects ﬂying close to vegetation. Its diet was diverse, with Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera being the main diet components. During summer, males and females differed in their foraging patterns and energetic strategies: Lactating females departed for more frequent foraging bouts than males, and maintained euthermy throughout the day, while males became torpid on a daily basis.",

            "abstractNote": "Populations of Myotis bechsteinii in Sierra de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park (southwestern Spain) survive in a large, old-growth coniferous woodland, which is in contrast with known ecological preferences of the species. We tracked ten lactating females and studied patterns of habitat selection by Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii) at two spatial scales: macrohabitat and microhabitat, regarding forest essence (coniferous vs. deciduous). The tracked individuals always foraged within forested areas and did not use areas devoid of trees. At the macrohabitat level, no positive selection of deciduous stands was apparent, suggesting selection studies of coarse resolution may not be able to capture subtle selection patterns. At the microhabitat level Myotis bechsteinii selected deciduous patches within the coniferous matrix, therefore, our results corroborate the perception of this species as dependent of services provided by deciduous woodlands. Larger foraging home ranges and commuting distances as compared with other Mediterranean localities suggest that our studied population inhabits a marginal or suboptimal environment in terms of habitat quality. We argue that this population of Bechstein’s bat has survived as a relict one probably as a consequence of fragmentation and transformation of deciduous forest ecosystems in the Mediterranean range.",

            "abstractNote": "Natural hibernation sites used by bats in areas that lack cave features have long remained unresolved. To investigate hibernation site selection and winter activity of boreal bats, we recorded bat calls using passive acoustic monitoring at 16 sites in South-Western Finland. These sites included four rock outcrops with crevices and cave features, three glacial erratics or boulder fields, three ancient shores, three root cellars and three control sites where we did not expect bats to be overwintering. Our results revealed echolocation calls of Eptesicus nilssonii, Plecotus auritus and Myotis sp. We recorded significantly more activity near rock outcrops compared to other habitats, excluding root cellars. We also found that ambient temperature had a positive effect on bat activity and found evidence that P. auritus may be using low barometric pressure as a proxy for suitable foraging conditions during the winter. Our results suggest that rock outcrops may be more important to bats than previously acknowledged, highlighting the need to take these sites in account in planning of conservation measures. Furthermore, our findings underline the suitability of using acoustic monitoring in homing on hibernation sites that are not otherwise accessible.",

            "abstractNote": "Our understanding of trophic interactions of small insectivorous mammals has been drastically improved with the advent of DNA metabarcoding. The technique has continued to be optimised over the years, with primer choice repeatedly being a vital factor for dietary inferences. However, the majority of dietary studies examining the effect of primer choice often rely on in silico analyses or comparing between species that occupy an identical niche type. Here, we apply DNA metabarcoding to empirically compare the prey detection capabilities of two widely used primer sets when assessing the diets of a flying (lesser horseshoe bat; Rhinolophus hipposideros) and two ground-dwelling insectivores (greater white-toothed shrew; Crocidura russula and pygmy shrew; Sorex minutus). Although R. hipposideros primarily rely on two prey orders (Lepidoptera and Diptera), the unique taxa detected by each primer shows that a combination of primers may be the best approach to fully describe bat trophic ecology. However, random forest classifier analysis suggests that one highly degenerate primer set detected the majority of both shrews’ diet despite higher levels of host amplification. The wide range of prey consumed by ground-dwelling insectivores can therefore be accurately documented from using a single broad-range primer set, which can decrease cost and labour. The results presented here show that dietary inferences will differ depending on the primer or primer combination used for insectivores occupying different niches (i.e., hunting in the air or ground) and demonstrate the importance of performing empirical pilot studies for novel study systems.",

The role of insulin and the contribution of glycogen reserves during rest periods and the extent of its involvement in blood glucose homeostasis during exercise have not been described yet and was the main objective of this study. Bats (Anoura caudifer) were assigned to the following groups: (1) Water and Resting (WR): received water (0.25 mL) and rested for zero, 45 or 90 min; (2) Glucose and Resting (GR): fed with a glucose solution (5.4 g/Kbw) and rested for 45 or 90 min; (3) Glucose and Exercise (GE): fed with a glucose solution (5.4 g/Kbw) and were induced to fly for a total of 45 or 90 min. Oxidative stress and metabolic markers were analyzed in all groups. We also describe morphometric and stereological parameters in pancreas from WR bats. Blood glucose concentrations were increased 45 min after glucose intake in resting bats compared to bats forced to fly and also compared to resting bats which received no glucose. Blood glucose levels after 90 min were the same in all bats, returning to baseline levels in GR bats. Plasma insulin concentrations and liver and muscle glycogen content did not show any differences among groups. Our results provide evidence that insulin secretion seems to play a role on glucose regulation when bats are at rest and that the increased nitric oxide production in the kidneys found in GE90 may contribute to renal protection during exercise.",

The aim of the study was to determine whether raccoons pose a threat to bats wintering in the Nietoperek nature reserve, one of the largest hibernation sites in Central Europe. In the winter of 2016–2017, 67 raccoon scats were collected in one of the main underground corridors in the reserve. It was confirmed, with the use of molecular methods, that the scats belonged to raccoons. Raccoon prey was identified based on the features of skulls, jaws or hair found in the scats. Analysis of the determinable remains indicates that bats (including Daubenton’s bat/Natterer’s bat/Brandt’s bat M. daubentonii/nattereri/brandtii, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, greater mouse-eared bat Myotis myotis, brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus) made up the largest percentage of raccoon diet (96%). Remains of other mammal species, lizards Lacerta spp., plant materials and anthropogenic food were also identified in raccoon scats. The results of the research indicate that predation by raccoons can constitute a significant factor in the increasing mortality of bats wintering in Nietoperek.",

            "abstractNote": "Human-generated noise can deleteriously affect many animals. Echolocating bats, which crucially depend on sound for their activity, might therefore serve as bioindicators to quantify the ecological effects of sound pollution. While the influence of sound pollution on animal behaviour has been widely studied, the impact of music is almost unknown. We tested whether music, broadcast loudly, affects bats’ foraging and drinking behaviour. The study was done at two waterbodies, where bats drink and forage in the Negev Desert, Israel, during summertime, when water availability is limited: both sites, one isolated natural pond and one artificial waterbody, frequently host recreational parties and concerts. We broadcast music whose frequency range did not overlap with that of bat echolocation calls, and acoustically assessed bat activity before and after the music broadcast. At the remote waterbody, used by bats as a drinking site, the number of bat passes did not vary between treatments. However, after music was broadcast, bats performed significantly more unsuccessful drinking attempts. At the artificial waterbody—a foraging site—activity decreased significantly after music was broadcast. Additionally, music had a cumulative effect on bats, since overall activity significantly decreased over the experimental period. Noise may affect bats by narrowing their attention or distracting them from their primary task. Broadcasting loud music near remote waterbodies is, therefore, significantly hazardous for bats and other wildlife.",

For example, bats assume a wide variety of foraging strategies, dietary traits, different flight abilities, and New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are among the most functionally diverse family of bats. Nonetheless, this variation remains uncharacterized in Honduras. Our study investigated the relationship of environmental and climatic variables that influence leaf-nosed bat assemblages in terms of alpha and beta taxonomic and functional diversity. From February 2015 to May 2019, we sampled 56 sites and captured 1086 phyllostomid bats. We found that taxonomic alpha diversity decreased with elevation, and that functional alpha diversity decreased with elevation and humidity. Changes in taxonomic β-diversity were associated with elevation and changes in functional β-diversity were associated with humidity, elevation, and precipitation. Our findings suggest that elevation is the key environmental variable influencing New World leaf-nosed bat assemblages in Honduras, and even though species composition varies among different habitats, the functional composition of assemblages remains similar.",

As anthropogenic change alters the distribution of this species, shifts in predator–prey interactions are expected. Understanding prey richness and patterns of prey selection is, thus, increasingly informative from ecological, epidemiological, and economic perspectives. We reviewed D. rotundus diet and assessed the geographical, taxonomical, and behavioral features to find 63 vertebrate species within 21 orders and 45 families constitute prey, including suitable host species in regions of invasion outside D. rotundus’ range. Rodentia contained the largest number of species utilized by D. rotundus, though cattle were the most commonly reported prey source, likely linked to the high availability of livestock and visibility of bite wounds compared to wildlife. Additionally, there was tendency to predate upon species with diurnal activity and social behavior, potentially facilitating convenient and nocturnal predation. Our review highlights the dietary heterogeneity of D. rotundus across its distribution. We define D. rotundus as a generalist predator, or parasite, depending on the ecological definition of its symbiont roles in an ecosystem (i.e., lethal vs. non-lethal blood consumption). In view of the eminent role of D. rotundus in rabies virus transmission and its range expansion, an understanding of its ecology would benefit public health, wildlife management, and agriculture.",

            "abstractNote": "Biotic and abiotic environmental factors influence the abundance and spatial distribution of species and the structuring of communities along environmental gradients. Topography, vegetation structure and food availability have been identified as factors that directly and indirectly influence habitat selection by species in tropical forests. Although the factors that determine community structure in phyllostomid bats have received substantial attention, aerial insectivorous bats have been largely neglected, and their responses to environmental gradients in continuous tropical forests remain poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated how aerial insectivorous bats respond to different environmental gradients in 25 ­km2 of continuous preserved forest in Central Amazonia. Our hypothesis was that topography, vegetation structure and food availability influence aerial insectivorous bats. Insect biomass was shown to be the predictor variable with the greatest contribution to the bat species richness, abundance and assemblage composition. Bat activity and richness were positively related to insect biomass. Bat assemblage species composition was also related to terrain elevation and insect assemblage composition. Vegetation clutter did not influence the number of species, abundance and bat assemblage species composition. In contrast, vegetation clutter and terrain elevation influenced some bat species, indicating that the response to these variables was species-specific within the bat assemblage. Our study showed that the food availability, both the quantity and its distribution in the environment, was the main structuring factor of the bat community that occupy higher trophic levels, such as aerial insectivorous bats, in a continuous forest in Central Amazon.",
