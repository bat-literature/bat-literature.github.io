            "abstractNote": "The thesis investigates the socio-ecological factors driving human-leopard conflict due to livestock and game depredation in the Blouberg Mountain Range, South Africa. Local people’s perceptions of conservation are shaped by historical and contemporary relationships with protected areas and particularly, by conflicts of land and natural resource use. Legacies of disempowerment, marginalisation and stigmatisation manifest through people’s conservation discourses, social conflict and resistance towards protected area establishment, a process defined as traumatic nature. Traumatic nature elevates distrust of local people towards wildlife authorities and decreases support for wildlife conservation, aggravating humanleopard conflicts. Leopard predation on livestock and game is most strongly influenced by distance to village and distance to water, respectively, in addition to seasonal grazing patterns, the calving season and poor livestock husbandry practices. Livestock depredation represents significant economic costs for subsistence communal farmers’, which is exacerbated by the erosion of traditional cattle sharing systems and a lack of alternative livelihood strategies. Livestock depredation results in the loss of functional and material benefits, social capital, a spiritual resource, diminished wellbeing and perceived cultural decay. Camera trap results showed a lower leopard density of 0.7 leopards per 100km2 on commercial farms compared to the Blouberg Nature Reserve of 5.4 leopards per 100km2. Commercial farms may function as ecological traps because they represent areas with disproportionate leopard mortality that otherwise provide a high abundance of prey species for leopards. A male-biased sex ratio and a high number of sub-adult male leopards indicate high leopard mortality rates in the population. Camera trap results show low occupancy rates on communal land that may reflect a low large prey biomass, potentially caused by overhunting and habitat conversion. Farming communities ascribe a wide range of environmental values to the leopard that provide barriers and support for leopard conservation. Environmental institutions need to improve responses to reports of human-leopard conflicts and build trust and legitimacy in the eyes of local people by developing stronger working relationships with farming communities. The decentralisation of authority to local government actors to manage human-leopard conflicts and the devolution of responsibility to farmers to improve livestock husbandry practices is necessary to reduce depredation incidents. Incentive and education schemes are important for reducing lethal control measures and to improve tolerance of depredation incidents and leopard conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "My thesis addresses three key gaps in urban-ecology research, which lacks sufficient attention to (1) grassland biomes, (2) individual- and population-level effects, and (3) nonavian vertebrates. I hypothesized that in the fairly flat, homogeneous Prairies, the city (Calgary, Alberta) is like a structurally complex island, with increased availability of roosts and prey. Along with the urban heat island, these features of the urban environment would benefit Prairie bats, producing increased bat abundance, diversity and fitness in the city relative to outside. I acoustically monitored bat activity and captured bats in mist nets, and found that although urban bats were more abundant, they were not more diverse. Myotis lucifugus dominated bat assemblages throughout my study area, but nowhere more so than in Calgary. It appears that urbanization in the Prairies may create attractive habitat for one synanthropic species (M. lucifugus) but have the opposite effect for others. I sampled nocturnal insects to assess the potential availability of prey to bats, and acoustically monitored their foraging activity. Contrary to my predictions, neither insect abundance nor insect diversity was maximized in the city, and urban bats did not forage more than non-urban bats did. Thus, increased numbers of M. lucifugus in Calgary do not seem linked to an urban increase in prey availability. I assessed body condition, reproductive rates, spermatogenesis, production of juveniles, post-natal growth and population age structure in M. lucifugus. I found no support for predictions that urban bats have enhanced fitness relative to non-urban conspecifics. Instead, it appears that increased population density in the city may be detrimental to bats, perhaps by increasing intraspecific competition for food. Finally, I assessed the ectoparasite loads of urban and non-urban bats. The effects of urbanization in terms of modulating ectoparasitism were dependent on the bat species, bat group and parasite type, with no consistent pattern. Ultimately, I reject my overall hypothesis. Rather than benefitting Prairie bats, urbanization may be detrimental to them. This may reflect a more general negative effect of increased bat density and/or larger group size in the city.",

Behavioral units were identified then categorized in an ethogram as general maintenance behavior and social behavior. Activities of bats were sampled using the Instantaneous Sampling Method. Sleeping was the most dominant occurring behavior (80.42%) on the roost. Sleeping positions by flying foxes were probably driven by environmental conditions Jike weather, temperature and sunflecks. Other general maintenance behaviors were grooming (9.88%), locomotion (1.13%) searching (0.29%), stretching (0.33%), urinating (0.40%), defecating (0.43%), flying (2.64%), and fanning (2.25%). Social behaviors showed percent occurrences as: aggression (1.22%), courting (0.87%), and copulating (0.14%). Their roost site is 2 km from human habitation in Malagos. Two T. cope/andii trees were found to be the primary roost trees. Endospermum pe/tatum (gubas) was also used by the flying foxes although less commonly. Both tree species have low canopy cover, and horizontal branching patterns and fissured barks. Flying foxes were not observed roosting on other big trees with high canopy cover and ascending branching patterns.",

            "abstractNote": "Field biology is an area of research that involves working directly with living organisms in situ through a practice known as “fieldwork.” Conducting fieldwork often requires complex logistical planning within multiregional or multinational teams, followed by collaborative research led by one or a few of the core team members. However, existing power imbalances stemming from geopolitical history, discrimination, and professional position perpetuate inequities in the context of these research endeavors. After reflecting on our own research programs, we propose four general principles to guide equitable, inclusive, ethical, and safe practices in field biology: Be Collaborative, Be Legal, Be Safe, and Be Respectful. Although many field biologists already structure their field programs around these principles or similar values, executing equitable research practices can prove challenging and requires careful consideration, especially by those in positions with relatively greater privilege. Based on experiences and input from a diverse group of global collaborators, we provide suggestions for action-oriented approaches to making field biology more equitable under these guidelines, with particular attention to how those with greater privilege can contribute. While we acknowledge that not all suggestions will be applicable to every institution or program, we hope that they will generate discussions and provide a baseline for training in proactive, equitable fieldwork practices.",

The discovery of these shrew-borne hantaviruses, named Ash River virus and Jemez Springs virus, respectively, challenges the long-held dogma that rodents are the sole reservoir hosts and forces a re-examination of their co-evolutionary history. Also, studies now underway are aimed at clarifying the epizootiology and pathogenicity of these new members of the genus Hantavirus.",

            "abstractNote": "The skin microbiome is an essential line of host defense against pathogens, yet our understanding of microbial communities and how they change when hosts become infected is limited. We investigated skin microbial composition in three North American bat species (Myotis lucifugus, Eptesicus fuscus, and Perimyotis subflavus) that have been impacted by the infectious disease, white-nose syndrome, caused by an invasive fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. We compared bacterial and fungal composition from 154 skin swab samples and 70 environmental samples using a targeted 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon approach. We found that for M. lucifugus, a species that experiences high mortality from white-nose syndrome, bacterial microbiome diversity was dramatically lower when P. destructans is present. Key bacterial families—including those potentially involved in pathogen defense—significantly differed in abundance in bats infected with P. destructans compared to uninfected bats. However, skin bacterial diversity was not lower in E. fuscus or P. subflavus when P. destructans was present, despite populations of the latter species declining sharply from white-nose syndrome. The fungal species present on bats substantially overlapped with the fungal taxa present in the environment at the site where the bat was sampled, but fungal community composition was unaffected by the presence of P. destructans for any of the three bat species. This species-specific alteration in bat skin bacterial microbiomes after pathogen invasion may suggest a mechanism for the severity of WNS in M. lucifugus, but not for other bat species impacted by white-nose syndrome.",

However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. We used a Bayesian statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission, and dispersal in China. We find that host-switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha-than beta-CoVs, and more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus\n            Rhinolophus\n            . Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in\n            Rhinolophus\n            spp. bats.",
