The RNAS was facilitated by an initiating collaborative research grant from WHO/TDR in 1999. The main activities and achievements of the RNAS during its ﬁrst 2 years of existence are described. It is hoped that more interested parties will become involved in the network activities and other international agencies will consider providing technical and ﬁnancial support to the network in the future to ensure the sustained development of the RNAS. The website of RNAS is now available in both English and Chinese versions with URL address: http://www.rnas.org. Thus far, the RNAS has held two important meetings with a third planned for 2002. The annual meeting will involve scientists and control authorities from all countries endemic for Asian schistosomiasis, providing a forum for more regional cooperation and coordination. More focus will be directed at training activities in speciﬁc ﬁelds such as immunodiagnostics, standardization of ultrasound use for monitoring infection-related morbidity, cost factor analysis, application of GIS/RS technology, environmental modiﬁcation and human behaviour, agricultural efforts including livestock management for control of schistosome transmission, etc. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We report the effects of tourist Trail-Type and -Use on the incidence of mammal ﬁeldsigns in a PA in central China. Surveys conducted adjacent to ﬁve categories of trail-type and ﬁeldsigns were scored for three duplicates of four 0.5 km transects (=60 transects). Higher Trail Use along more major Trail Types were associated with signiﬁcantly fewer ﬁeldsigns along transects close to trails, compared with more distant transects. Fieldsign scores along transects adjacent to less used, unpaved trails were far less affected. In multiple-regression models, species and guilds exhibited different ﬁeldsign score responses to Trail Type and Use. In general, a paucity of larger mammal (>15 kg) ﬁeldsigns was associated primarily with greater Trail Use, whereas ﬁeldsign scores for smaller mammals were associated more strongly with human-modiﬁed forest types. As international demand for nature-based tourism continues to grow it is important to evaluate openly the consequences of providing public access to protected areas while conserving biodiversity.",

Four reasons may have been responsible: (1) Cave exploitation for tourism has changed the atmosphere and temperature in caves, disturbing bats directly. (2) Extensive pesticide use has resulted in bioaccumulation in bats, reducing their survival. (3) Many old buildings were demolished during urbanization, reducing the availability of suitable roost sites. (4) People often include bats in their diet, and bats are served in restaurants. We make recommendations for improving bat conservation in China. Education programmes about bat conservation should be provided for adults and schoolchildren, and laws for protecting bats need to be enacted and enforced. The roosting sites of bats should be protected comprehensively, and pesticide use should be regulated.",

            "abstractNote": "Southern China is a hot spot of emerging infectious diseases, in which diverse species of bats dwell, a large group of ﬂying mammals considered natural reservoirs for zoonotic viruses. Recently, divergent ﬁloviruses (FiVs) have been identiﬁed in bats within this region, which pose a potential risk to public health, but the true infection situation in bats remains largely unclear. Here, 689 archived bat serum samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and neutralization assay to investigate the seroprevalence and cross-reactivity of four divergent FiVs and two other viruses (rabies virus and Tuhoko pararubulavirus 1) of different families within the order Mononegavirales. Results showed no cross-antigenicity between FiVs and other mononegaviruses but different cross-reactivity among the FiVs themselves. The total FiV seroreactive rate was 36.3% (250/689), with infection by the indigenous Chinese FiV DH04 or an antigenically related one being the most widely and the most highly prevalent. Further viral metagenomic analysis of fruit bat tissues also identiﬁed the gene sequence of a novel FiV. These results indicate the likely prevalence of other so far unidentiﬁed FiVs within the Chinese bat population, with frugivorous Rousettus leschenaultii and Eonycteris spelaea bats and insectivorous Myotis horsﬁeldii and Miniopterus schreibersii bats being their major reservoirs.",

We found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the occurrence of 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus (named as Pangolin-CoV) from dead Malayan Pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin-CoV has similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, and would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.",

The question of how community disassembly—the ongoing process of nonrandom species losses and declines—affects ecosystem functions, including those that influence persistence of other species, is addressed. The order in which species disappear from a community depends on their vulnerability to specific stressors and on traits associated with inherent susceptibility to decline. Information on species characteristics associated with vulnerability (response traits) is synthesized, and it is asked whether they are associated with characteristics that underpin significant contributions to ecosystem functioning (effect traits). Direct evidence that community disassembly affects ecosystem functioning comes from a variety of sources, ranging from documentation of long‐term changes following the loss of an initial species or fragmentation of a landscape, to modeling and manipulative experiments that simulate species losses and observe their consequences. The usefulness to conservation and restoration practice of community disassembly as a concept is evaluated, and it is asked whether and how community disassembly can provide guidance about species loss order, its consequences, what each of these depends on, and whether a positive link exists between vulnerability and contribution to function—a link that would exacerbate the consequences of the ongoing extinction crisis.",

Considerable variations of the parasite load between host species, ages and sexes were found, which can be attributed to roosting conditions and behavioural differences of the bats. Overall, male bats had the fewest parasites. Very different parasite population densities were found in different years, and also at the same time at different sites. A generally high parasite load during the nursing season was not observed. There was no strong trend of increasing parasite load in bats with decreasing condition. If weak bats had more parasites than other individuals, the high number of parasites seemed to be a symptom and not the direct cause of the bad condition.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Viruses in the genus Henipavirus encompass 2 highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic pathogens, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV). Despite the impact on human health, there is currently limited full-genome sequence information available for henipaviruses. This lack of full-length genomes hampers our ability to understand the molecular drivers of henipavirus emergence. Furthermore, rapidly deployable viral genome sequencing can be an integral part of outbreak response and epidemiological investigations to study transmission chains. In this study, we describe the development of a reverse-transcription, long-range polymerase chain reaction (LRPCR) assay for efficient genome amplification of NiV, HeV, and a related non-pathogenic henipavirus, Cedar virus (CedPV). We then demonstrated the utility of our method by amplifying partial viral genomes from 6 HeV-infected tissue samples from Syrian hamsters and 4 tissue samples from a NiV-infected African green monkey with viral loads as low as 52 genome copies/mg. We subsequently sequenced the amplified genomes on the portable Oxford Nanopore MinION platform and analyzed the data using a newly developed field-deployable bioinformatic pipeline. Our LRPCR assay allows amplification and sequencing of 2 or 4 amplicons in semi-nested reactions. Coupled with an easy-to-use bioinformatics pipeline, this method is particularly useful in the field during outbreaks in resource-poor environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Significance\n            Understanding the effects of biodiversity loss on zoonotic disease is of pressing importance to both conservation science and public health. This paper provides experimental evidence of increased landscape-level disease risk following declines in large wildlife, using the case study of the rodent-borne zoonosis, bartonellosis, in East Africa. This pattern is driven not by changes in community composition or diversity of hosts, as frequently proposed in other systems, but by increases in abundance of susceptible hosts following large mammal declines. Given that rodent increases following large wildlife declines appear to be a widespread pattern, we suggest this relationship is likely to be general.\n          , \n            \n              Populations of large wildlife are declining on local and global scales. The impacts of this pulse of size-selective defaunation include cascading changes to smaller animals, particularly rodents, and alteration of many ecosystem processes and services, potentially involving changes to prevalence and transmission of zoonotic disease. Understanding linkages between biodiversity loss and zoonotic disease is important for both public health and nature conservation programs, and has been a source of much recent scientific debate. In the case of rodent-borne zoonoses, there is strong conceptual support, but limited empirical evidence, for the hypothesis that defaunation, the loss of large wildlife, increases zoonotic disease risk by directly or indirectly releasing controls on rodent density. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally excluding large wildlife from a savanna ecosystem in East Africa, and examining changes in prevalence and abundance of\n              Bartonella\n              spp. infection in rodents and their flea vectors. We found no effect of wildlife removal on per capita prevalence of\n              Bartonella\n              infection in either rodents or fleas. However, because rodent and, consequently, flea abundance doubled following experimental defaunation, the density of infected hosts and infected fleas was roughly twofold higher in sites where large wildlife was absent. Thus, defaunation represents an elevated risk in\n              Bartonella\n              transmission to humans (bartonellosis). Our results (\n              i\n              ) provide experimental evidence of large wildlife defaunation increasing landscape-level disease prevalence, (\n              ii\n              ) highlight the importance of susceptible host regulation pathways and host/vector density responses in biodiversity–disease relationships, and (\n              iii\n              ) suggest that rodent-borne disease responses to large wildlife loss may represent an important context where this relationship is largely negative.",

We developed a 10 living data workflow for a long­term ecological study that addresses many of the challenges associated with managing this type of data. We do this by leveraging existing tools to: 1) perform quality assurance and control; 2) import, restructure, version, and archive data; 3) rapidly publish new data in ways that ensure appropriate credit to all contributors; and 4) automate most steps in the data pipeline to reduce the time and effort required by researchers. 15 The workflow uses two tools from software development, version control and continuous integration, to create a modern data management system that automates the pipeline.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: During the past two decades, three novel coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged to cause international human epidemics with severe morbidity. CoVs have also emerged to cause severe epidemics in animals. A better understanding of the natural hosts and genetic diversity of CoVs are needed to help mitigate these threats.\nObjective: To design and evaluate a molecular diagnostic tool for detection and identiﬁcation of all currently recognized and potentially future emergent CoVs from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Study design and Results: We designed a semi-nested, reverse transcription RT-PCR assay based upon 38 published genome sequences of human and animal CoVs. We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses. Through sequencing the assay's target amplicon, the assay correctly identiﬁed each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with 11 common respiratory viruses was observed. The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4 × 102 copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested. To assess the assay's clinical performance, we tested a large panel of previously studied specimens: 192 human respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients, 5 clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients, 81 poultry oral secretion specimens, 109 pig slurry specimens, and 31 aerosol samples from a live bird market. The amplicons of all RT-PCR-positive samples were conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. Our assay performed well with all tested specimens across all sample types.\nConclusions: This assay can be used for detection and identiﬁcation of all previously recognized CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and potentially any emergent CoVs in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.",

            "abstractNote": "It is now widely accepted that novel infectious disease can be a leading cause of serious population decline and even outright extinction in some invertebrate and vertebrate groups (e.g., amphibians). In the case of mammals, however, there are still no well-corroborated instances of such diseases having caused or significantly contributed to the complete collapse of species. A case in point is the extinction of the endemic Christmas Island rat (Rattus macleari): although it has been argued that its disappearance ca. AD 1900 may have been partly or wholly caused by a pathogenic trypanosome carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), no decisive evidence for this scenario has ever been adduced. Using ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888–1908), we were able to resolve unambiguously sequence evidence of murid trypanosomes in both endemic and invasive rats. Importantly, endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of black rats were devoid of trypanosome signal. Hybridization between endemic and black rats was also previously hypothesized, but we found no evidence of this in examined specimens, and conclude that hybridization cannot account for the disappearance of the endemic species. This is the first molecular evidence for a pathogen emerging in a na¨ıve mammal species immediately prior to its final collapse.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Rodents represent around 43% of all mammalian species, are widely distributed, and are the natural reservoirs of a diverse group of zoonotic viruses, including hantaviruses, Lassa viruses, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Thus, analyzing the viral diversity harbored by rodents could assist efforts to predict and reduce the risk of future emergence of zoonotic viral diseases.\nResults: We used next-generation sequencing metagenomic analysis to survey for a range of mammalian viral families in rodents and other small animals of the orders Rodentia, Lagomorpha, and Soricomorpha in China. We sampled 3,055 small animals from 20 provinces and then outlined the spectra of mammalian viruses within these individuals and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of novel rodent and shrew viruses among the viral spectra. Further analysis revealed that host taxonomy plays a primary role and geographical location plays a secondary role in determining viral diversity. Many viruses were reported for the first time with distinct evolutionary lineages, and viruses related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. Phylogram comparison between viruses and hosts indicated that host shifts commonly happened in many different species during viral evolutionary history.\nConclusions: These results expand our understanding of the viromes of rodents and insectivores in China and suggest that there is high diversity of viruses awaiting discovery in these species in Asia. These findings, combined with our previous bat virome data, greatly increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife in a densely populated country in an emerging disease hotspot.",

Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing\n              4\n              of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family\n              Coronaviridae\n              , which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China\n              5\n              . This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.",

Population biology has yet to explain why perceived evolutionary advantages of pathogen specialization are, in practice, outweighed by those of generalization. Factors that predispose pathogens to generalism include high levels of genetic diversity and abundant opportunities for cross-species transmission, and the taxonomic distributions of generalists and specialists appear to reflect these factors. Generalism also has consequences for the evolution of virulence and for pathogen epidemiology, making both much less predictable. The evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of generalism are so finely balanced that even closely related pathogens can have very different host range sizes.",

These hormonal responses are called stress responses especially in cases when major changes in physiology and behaviour occur (emergency life‐history stage).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Permanent perturbations require more than just temporary acclimation resulting in changes in range, adaptation or in some cases local extinction. Perturbations can be abiotic, biotic and social, but these are not mutually exclusive.\n                \n                \n                  Here I focus on the effects of abiotic perturbation factors and their effects on the hypothalamo‐pituitary–adrenal/interrenal axis in vertebrates. There is a great need for more field investigations of responses of free‐living populations to perturbations of the environment, especially now that it appears the frequency and intensity of these events is increasing. However, such studies will require a high degree of opportunism on the part of the investigators to take advantage of unpredictable events when they occur.\n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            \n              Lay Summary",

Inhalant anesthesia was delivered into a specially designed restraint and inhalation capsule that minimized handling and bite exposures. Bats were immobilized an average of 9.1Ϯ5.1 (SD) min (range 1–71, nϭ876); blood sample volumes averaged 58Ϯ12 ␮l (range 13–126, nϭ718). We randomly selected control (subject to multiple procedures before release) and treatment (control procedures plus inhalant anesthesia and 1% of body weight blood sampling) groups in 2002 to assess treatment effects on daily survival over a 14-day period for adult female and volant juvenile bats captured at maternity roosts in buildings. We monitored survival after release using passive integrated transponder tag detection hoops placed at openings to selected roosts. Annual return rates of bats sampled in 2001 were used to assess long-term outcomes. Comparison of 14-day maximum-likelihood daily survival estimates from control (86 adult females, 92 volant juveniles) and treated bats (187 adult females, 87 volant juveniles) indicated no adverse effect from anesthesia and blood sampling (juveniles: ␹2ϭ22.22, dfϭ27, PϾ0.05; adults: ␹2ϭ9.72, dfϭ18, PϾ0.05). One-year return rates were similar among adult female controls (81%, nϭ72, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]ϭ70–91%), females treated once (82%, nϭ276, 95% CIϭ81–84%), and females treated twice (84%, nϭ50, 95% CIϭ74–94%). Lack of an effect was also noted in 1-yr return rates of juvenile female controls (55%, nϭ29, 95% CIϭ37–73%), juveniles treated once (66%, nϭ113, 95% CIϭ58–75%), and juveniles treated twice (71%, nϭ17, 95% CIϭ49–92%). These data suggest that anesthesia and blood sampling for health monitoring did not measurably affect survival of adult female and volant juvenile big brown bats.",
