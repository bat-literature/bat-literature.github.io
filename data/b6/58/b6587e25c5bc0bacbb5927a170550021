            "abstractNote": "Chinese pangolins are critically endangered insectivorous mammals distributed in several South and Southeast Asian countries. In recent years, there has been an increase in spread of tick-borne diseases in both humans and animals worldwide. Currently, limited information is available on ticks and associated pathogens infesting pangolins. The objective of the present study was to survey ticks and associated pathogens in the Formosan pangolin population in Southeastern Taiwan. Free-ranging Formosan pangolins captured during ecological survey were examined for the presence of ticks. DNA extracted from these ticks was used to identify the tick species and also to detect the tick-borne pathogens, by molecular methods. In the present study, we found 25% (13/52) of pangolins captured during 2012-2014 infested with ixodid ticks. A total of 21 ticks were collected and 3 species were identified: Haemaphysalis hystricis (14/21), Haemaphysalis formosensis (2/21) and Amblyomma testudinarium (5/21). We detected four different tick-borne pathogens, where one was identical to Anaplasma sp. strain An.H1446 while others showed close resemblance to Rickettsia conorii subsp. caspia A-167, Ehrlichia sp. TC251-2 and Cytauxzoon spp., respectively. The present study is the first survey of ticks infesting the free-ranging Chinese pangolins and pathogens harboured by these ticks. This information is important to know the diversity of ticks and tick-borne pathogens, and its conservation significance to pangolins and other sympatric wildlife. Important future step should be regular surveillance of ticks and tick-borne diseases at human-domestic animals-wildlife interface, which can provide a useful insight into the dynamics of these pathogens and can help control and prevent outbreak of zoonoses.",

The spectral sensitivities of the two classes of cones found in the retinas of two species of ground squirrel were measured using ERG flicker photometry. The spectral sensitivity curves for these cone classes were closely fit by curves from wavelength-dependent visual pigment nomo- grams. One cone type had an average peak sensi- tivity of 518.9 nm (California ground squirrels, Sperrnophilus beecheyi) or 517.0 nm (thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus). The second type of cone found in these ground squirrels had an average peak sensitivity of 436.7 nm. An examination of the variation in spec- tral sensitivity among individual animals suggests that the sensitivity peaks for the middle-wave- length cone cover a range of not greater than 4 nm.",

Many strains have zoonotic potential, moving between humans and animals, including livestock, pets, and wildlife. We examined publications reporting on S. aureus presence in a variety of wildlife species in order to more cohesively review distribution of strains and antibiotic resistance in wildlife. Fifty-one studies were included in the final qualitative synthesis. The most common types documented included ST398, ST425, ST1, ST133, ST130, and ST15. A mix of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains were noted. A number of molecular types were identified that were likely to be found in wildlife species, including those that are commonly found in humans or other animal species (including livestock). Additional research should include follow-up in geographic areas that are under-sampled in this study, which is dominated by European studies.",

In order for bushmeat surveys to capture the complex dynamics of the trade and ultimately, its sustainability, there is a need for scale-adapted survey design and adequate reporting of results. We performed a systematic review of bushmeat survey methodology published in scientific literature from 1983 to 2021, with a focus on conservation biology articles reporting quantifiable data on the bushmeat trade (148 articles). Studies were predominantly biodiversity-oriented, whereas fewer focused on economics, modelling sustainability and conservation policy. Bushmeat survey efforts were mostly North-driven and biased towards high GDP African countries. Surveys generally suffered from narrow spatiotemporal design and limited market.day efforts, and consistently omitted intermediary wholesalers from the commodity chains. Species identification was mostly based on indirect approaches (interviews) and when combined with direct observations, failed to report the taxonomic reference used. We observed blatant gaps in reporting on survey efforts, species numbers and volumes, and conservation status. The number of surveyed species – highly biased towards mammals – was generally low, the proportion of unidentified species was high in turtles and amphibians, and the implementation of DNA-typing has remained anecdotal. Lack of rigor in reporting and weaknesses in survey design globally challenge the repeatability of the bushmeat surveys conducted in tropical African rainforests and their ability to question the sustainability of the trade. Updating and harmonizing bushmeat surveys through regional monitoring systems may be key to a better diffusion of bushmeat trade issues into state agendas.",

The field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) has provided new insights to help understand the pathophysiological processes that are linked to the immune system. Work in this field has established that psychological stress disrupts the functional interaction between the nervous and immune systems. Stress-induced immune dysregulation has been shown to be significant enough to result in health consequences, including reducing the immune response to vaccines, slowing wound healing, reactivating latent herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and enhancing the risk for more severe infectious disease. Chronic stress/depression can increase the peripheral production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6. High serum levels of IL-6 have been linked to risks for several conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, mental health complications, and some cancers. This overview will discuss the evidence that psychological stress promotes immune dysfunction that negatively impacts human health.",

An effort is made here to compare and contrast jaw characteristics of insectivorous bats with those of herbivores and carnivores. Further, in one particular family of bats (Molossidae) jaw modifications are such that animals that take hard-shelled insect prey can be distinguished from those that take soft-shelled insect prey. Beetle-eaters generally have thick jaws, well-developed cranial crests, and fewer but bigger teeth, whereas moth-eaters have thin jaws, little crest build-up, and more but smaller teeth.",

We intend, with this systematic analysis and meta-analysis, to clarify the prevalence of the various strains of coronavirus in different animal species. For this purpose, we carried out an electronic survey using Pubmed's Veterinary Science search tool to conduct a systematic assessment of published studies reporting the prevalence of different strains of coronavirus in different animal species between 2015 and 2020. We conducted different analysis to assess sensitivity, publication bias, and heterogeneity, using random effect. The final meta-analysis included 42 studies for systematic review and 29 in the meta-analysis. For the geographic regions with a prevalence greater than or equal to 0.20 (Forest plot overall; prevalence = 0.20, p < 0.01, Q = 10,476.22 and I2 = 100%), the most commonly detected viruses were: enteric coronavirus (ECoV), pigeon-dominant coronavirus, (PdCoV), Avian coronavirus M41, Avian coronavirus C46, Avian coronavirus A99, Avian coronavirus JMK, MERS-CoV, Bovine coronavirus, Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gamacoronavirus and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). The wide presence of different strains of coronavirus in different animal species on all continents demonstrates the great biodiversity and ubiquity of these viruses. The most recent epidemiological crises caused by coronavirus demonstrates our unpreparedness to anticipate and mitigate emerging risks, as well as the need to implement new epidemiological surveillance programs for viruses. Combined with the need to create advanced training courses in One Health, this is paramount in order to ensure greater effectiveness in fighting the next pandemics.",

            "abstractNote": "To reverse the trend of declining wildlife populations globally, individuals must be provided with conditions that allow them to not just survive, but to thrive. It is no longer only the remit of captive breeding programs to ensure animal well-being; in situ conservation efforts also must consider how environmental and anthropogenic pressures impact wild populations, and how to mitigate them—especially with regards to reproduction and survival. Stress and welfare are complex concepts that necessitate an understanding of how stressors affect animals on both individual and population levels. There are species differences in how factors impact well-being, related in part to natural history, which also are shaped by individual perceptions and coping abilities. A multitude of stress-related responses then have the potential to disrupt fertility on many levels, and ultimately fitness. A major limitation to advancing welfare science is the lack of definitive tests to verify welfare status; i.e., is the animal happy or not? While analyses of circulating or excreted glucocorticoids have for decades been the primary method of assessing stress, today we recognize the need for more objective indicators that incorporate multiple physiological systems, including behavior, to assess both negative and positive welfare states. In this chapter, we discuss the potential for stress to disrupt, and sometimes facilitate reproduction, including the key role that glucocorticoids play. We then discuss a number of physiological biomarkers, which in addition to glucocorticoids, have the potential to assess well-being and the role of stress on reproduction. Finally, we discuss allostatic load, a method by which multiple physiological markers are used to inform on morbidity and mortality risk in humans, which if applied to wildlife, could be a powerful tool for conservation.",

However, habitat loss, hunting and the continued presence of humans have a negative effect on the biology and behaviour of almost all nonhuman primates. Noninvasive methods such as stool collection are among the safest alternative ways to study the multiple aspects of the biology of primates. Many epidemiologic issues (e.g. pathogen detection, microbiota studies) may be easily studied using stool samples from primates. Primates are undoubtedly among the first candidates suspected of becoming the source of one of the next emerging epidemic of zoonotic origin, as has already been observed with HIV, malaria and monkeypox. The Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection in Marseille actively participates in the study, mostly epidemiologic, of nonhuman primates, using mostly stool samples.",

This lack of knowledge is particularly problematic for conservation under conditions of political instability, when the informal economy can be highly dynamic and impacts on wildlife populations can be severe. To explore these interlinked processes, we conducted a study of the bushmeat trade in Garamba National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, through a combination of market surveys, semistructured interviews, and direct observation. We focused on the sale of protected and unprotected species in urban and rural markets, and the bushmeat commodity chains that supplied these markets, under conditions of political stability and armed conflict. During peacetime, protected species from the park (predominantly elephant and buffalo) rarely appeared in the rural markets, but they comprised more than half of all bushmeat sales in the urban markets. This pattern reflected differences in the rural and urban commodity chains. Automatic weapons were urban trade. The use of such weapons was discouraged by the traditional chiefs, who administered the village markets. During wartime, the sales of protected species in the urban markets increased fivefold because the military officers fled, leaving behind an open-access system that led to a massive increase in the exploitation of protected species. In contrast, the rural markets remained relatively stable because of the continued authority of the village chiefs. Our results indicate that sociopolitical factors can be an important determinant of species offtake and, therefore, that knowledge of the bushmeat commodity chain can be vital to controlling theprocesses that drive species extraction. In addition, our findings suggest that traditional authorities can be potentially valuable partners for bushmeat management.",

            "abstractNote": "Serine incorporator protein 5 (SERINC5) is the host antiretroviral factor that reduces HIV-1 infectivity by incorporating into virions and inhibiting the envelope glycoprotein (Env) mediated virus fusion with target cells. We and others have shown that SERINC5 incorporation into virions alters the Env structure and sensitizes the virus to broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting cryptic Env epitopes. We have also found that SERINC5 accelerates the loss of Env function over time compared to control viruses. However, the exact mechanism by which SERINC5 inhibits HIV-1 fusion is not understood. Here, we utilized 2D and 3D super-resolution microscopy to examine the effect of SERINC5 on the distribution of Env glycoproteins on single HIV-1 particles. We find that, in agreement with a previous report, Env glycoproteins form clusters on the surface of mature virions. Importantly, incorporation of SERINC5, but not SERINC2, which lacks antiviral activity, disrupted Env clusters without affecting the overall Env content. We also show that SERINC5 and SERINC2 also form clusters on single virions. Unexpectedly, Env and SERINC molecules exhibited poor codistribution on virions, as evidenced by much greater Env–SERINC pairwise distances compared to Env–Env distances. This observation is inconsistent with the previously reported interaction between Env and SERINC5 and suggests an indirect effect of SERINC5 on Env cluster formation. Collectively, our results reveal a multifaceted mechanism of SERINC5-mediated restriction of HIV-1 fusion that, aside from the effects on individual Env trimers, involves disruption of Env clusters, which likely serve as sites of viral fusion with target cells.",

            "abstractNote": "The widely held assumption that any important scientific information would be available in English underlies the underuse of non-English-language science across disciplines. However, non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language science to scientific communities and the application of science is rarely quantified. Here, we show that non-English-language studies provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation. By screening 419,679 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified 1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to 4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria. Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an increasing rate in 6 out of the 12 languages where there were a sufficient number of relevant studies. Incorporating non-English-language studies can expand the geographical coverage (i.e., the number of 2° × 2° grid cells with relevant studies) of English-language evidence by 12% to 25%, especially in biodiverse regions, and taxonomic coverage (i.e., the number of species covered by the relevant studies) by 5% to 32%, although they do tend to be based on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based conservation globally. We urge wider disciplines to rigorously reassess the untapped potential of non-English-language science in informing decisions to address other global challenges.
