Rhinolophus bats are important hosts for coronaviruses. Many SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been detected in bats from different areas of China; however, the diversity of bat SARSr-CoVs is increasing, and their transmission mechanisms have attracted much attention. Here, we report the ﬁndings of SARSr-CoVs in R. sinicus and R. afﬁnis from South China from 2008 to 2021. The fulllength genome sequences of the two novel SARSr-CoVs obtained from Guangdong shared 83 to 88% and 71 to 72% nucleotide identities with human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, while sharing high similarity with human SARS-CoV in hypervariable open reading frame 8 (ORF8). Signiﬁcant recombination occurred between the two novel SARSr-CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two novel bat SARSr-CoVs from Guangdong were more distant than the bat SARSr-CoVs from Yunnan to human SARS-CoV. We found that transmission in bats contributes more to virus diversity than time. Although our results of the sequence analysis of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and the expression pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inferred that these viruses could not directly infect humans, risks still exist after some unpredictable mutations. Thus, this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity and transmission of SARSr-CoVs carried by bats in the ﬁeld.",

            "abstractNote": "St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is the prototypic mosquito-borne ﬂavivirus in the Americas. Birds are its primary vertebrate hosts, but ampliﬁcation in certain mammals has also been suggested. The place and time of SLEV emergence remain unknown. In an ecological investigation in a tropical rainforest in Palenque National Park, Mexico, we discovered an ancestral variant of SLEV in Culex nigripalpus mosquitoes. Those SLEV-Palenque strains form a highly distinct phylogenetic clade within the SLEV species. Cell culture studies of SLEV-Palenque versus epidemic SLEV (MSI-7) revealed no growth differences in insect cells but a clear inability of SLEV-Palenque to replicate in cells from birds, cotton rats, and free-tailed bats permissive for MSI-7 replication. Only cells from nonhuman primates and neotropical fruit bats were moderately permissive. Phylogeographic reconstruction identiﬁed the common ancestor of all epidemic SLEV strains to have existed in an area between southern Mexico and Panama ca. 330 years ago. Expansion of the epidemic lineage occurred in two waves, the ﬁrst representing emergence near the area of origin and the second involving almost parallel appearances of the virus in the lower Mississippi and Amazon delta regions. Early diversiﬁcation events overlapped human habitat invasion during the post-Columbian era. Several documented SLEV outbreaks, such as the 1964 Houston epidemic or the 1990 Tampa epidemic, were predated by the arrival of novel strains between 1 and 4 years before the outbreaks. Collectively, our data provide insight into the putative origins of SLEV, suggesting that virus emergence was driven by human invasion of primary rainforests.",

The viral RNA has been detected in eight additional cases. Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the viral genomic RNA showed that it is a novel virus not previously detected in any other species and that its closest relatives are two Asian bat coronaviruses. HCoV-EMC may represent a sporadic spillover to humans from an unknown animal reservoir. In a recent article, van Boheemen et al. demonstrated how state-of-theart sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis can quickly provide critical insight into the viral genome sequence, phylogeny, replication strategy, and potential drug and vaccine targets and generate tools to evaluate the possible epidemic risk associated with this novel human virus.",

O estado de Alagoas no Nordeste do Brasil inclui áreas dos biomas Caatinga e Mata Atlântica. Pesquisas sobre a fauna de morcegos de Alagoas são ainda incipientes comaparadas aos estados vizinhos do Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba e Pernambuco, e a diversidade e ecologia dos morcegos do estado são ainda praticamente desconhecidas. No presente estudo, fornecemos um checklist atualizado das espécies de morcegos do estado de Alagoas, localidades de coleta, e comparamos a riqueza de espécies com aquelas registradas em outras regiões para aumentar o conhecimento disponível sobre a fauna do estado. Para este m, zemos uma compilação abrangente de estudos anteriores e revimos o material (e.g., peles, crânios e espécimes úmidos) depositado nas coleções cientí cas de universidades federais e museus. Foram realizadas amostragens acústicas nos municípios de Piranhas, Olho d’Água do Casado, Arapiraca e Japaratinga. Registramos um total de 66 espécies pertencentes a 40 gêneros e oito famílias em Alagoas. Doze espécies foram registradas pela primeira vez no estado, oito das quais foram con rmadas a partir de coleções cientí cas e quatro por amostragens acústicas. Isso representa um aumento de treze espécies para a Caatinga no estado de Alagoas, em comparação com os dados publicados. Os registros estão distribuídos em 60 localidades, a maioria das quais na região da Mata Atlântica, em 31 dos 102 municípios do estado. A família mais diversa é Phyllostomidae (38 species), seguida por Molossidae (10 species), Vespertilionidae (6 species), Emballonuridae (6 species), Mormoopidae (2 species), Noctilionidae (2 species), Natalidae (1 species), e Thyropteridae (1 species). Embora não con rmado neste estudo, registros de Furipteridae em regiões vizinhas sugerem que essa família deve também ocorrer em cavidades naturais de zonas cársticas de Alagoas. O estado representa apenas 0,32 % da área territorial do Brazil, mas abriga 36,26 % das espécies de morcegos reconhecidas no país. O aumento da riqueza de espécies conhecidas de Chiroptera em Alagoas aqui apresentado destaca a importância de análisar coleções cientí cas e utilização de métodos acústicos para obter o inventário mais completo da fauna de morcegos de uma determinada área. Com base nestes resultados, recomendamos potenciais linhas de investigação para assegurar uma amostragem mais abrangente da fauna de morcegos do estado brasileiro de Alagoas, particularmente, no bioma Caatinga.",

The Brazilian Caatinga has a high speleological potential and a rich bat fauna, being a priority region for studies and inventories on cave dwelling-bats. Here, we present the rst species’ list of cave dwelling-bats of the sandstone karst of the Catimbau National Park, in Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil. Samplings in 53 caves resulted in 16 taxa and 13 genera of bats of the families Phyllostomidae, Mormoopidae, Natalidae, Furipteridae and Emballonuridae. Populations of four endangered species (Furipterus horrens, Lonchorhina aurita, Xeronycteris vieirai, and Natalus macrourus) were located in eight caves, including two bat caves holding exceptionally large bat populations. Lonchophylla inexpectata was recorded for the rst time in caves. Both the local speleological potential and the bat species richness were not completely investigated, pointing out that new colonies and species may still be recorded in the studied area. Besides the scienti c contribution, our data can be useful for a future management plan for the Catimbau National Park and can also contribute to set some ordering in the existing speleotourism in the area.",

However, knowledge about bat ectoparasites is limited to a few general species lists and to the description in terms of composition and structure of bat parasitic arthropodofauna in a tropical rain and tropical dry forest. Recently, it has been evidenced that bat assemblages in savanna ecosystems of the Orinoquia region are highly diverse, consequently, knowledge about their ectoparasites is still unknown. The objective of this work is to present for the rst time a list of bats ectoparasites in a oodplain savanna ecosystem in the department of Casanare, in the Colombian Llanos. We examined 102 bats belonging to eight species, we found 18 ectoparasite species. These parasites correspond to six families and ve orders as follows, Diptera: Streblidae (9 spp.); Mesostigmata: Spinturnicidae (3 spp.) and Macronyssidae (3 spp.); Astigmata: Labidocarpidae (1 sp.); Ixodida: Ixodidae (1 sp.); Hemiptera: Polyctenidae (1 sp.). We report for the rst time in Colombia the species Strebla tonatiae, Pseudostrebla greenwelli, Hesperoctenes eumops, Chiroptonyssus haematophagus and Parakosa exipes.",

We assessed the effect of artificial lighting on Artibeus lituratus and Artibeus jamaicensis in a small secondary growth forest patch near a street subjected to unexpected illumination. Bats were captured in the forest patch using a 12-m long mist net. Results indicated a nearly six-fold, significant decrease in capture success after the street lamps were installed. Artificial light from street lamps functions as a “light barrier” that inhibits bats from conducting short and long-distance movements, which might have detrimental consequences for bats and the plants they disperse.",

The checklist has been organized in four ways, first as a helminth-host list in the state of Morelos, second as a helminth-host list with taxonomic and geographic distributional information, third as a bat-helminth list with references, and last, as a summary of the host-helminth association. A total of 105 records and 67 helminth taxa (26 trematodes, 4 cestodes, and 37 nematodes [33 adult and 5 larvae]) in 27 bat species from the families Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Mormoopidae, Natalidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae are presented for Mexico and Central America. Eight species of helminths are unique to Central America and ten species occur in both Mexico and the isthmus. From the helminths recorded in Mexico, 34 helminth species in 19 species of bats are present in the state of Morelos. The helminth diversity represents 58% of the total recorded thus far in Mexico, yet the diversity of bats intensively surveyed for parasites in the country represents roughly 14% of the diversity of chiropterans present. This evidence suggests that these intensive examinations are necessary to complete the helminthological record for bats, especially in areas of high endemism.",

Para este congreso las circunstancias de la pandemia global generada por la COVID-19 nos obligaron a realizar el congreso de forma virtual, un reto que asumimos desde la SCMas con mucha expectativa y un poco de temor. Muy a pesar del formato virtual estamos muy satisfechos, pues la participación fue amplia, con 305 personas atendiendo al evento, de las cuales 293 descargaron la plataforma Whova.  Esta plataforma y su aplicación móvil nos permitieron realizar un congreso virtual menos rígido, con algunos datos que presentamos gráficamente. Estos datos reflejan el constante interés en el evento a pesar del formato virtual, y habla del congreso en términos de su impacto en Colombia y la región. Desde el Comité Organizador esperamos que el congreso continúe realizándose en el futuro de forma presencial, aportando al conocimiento de diferentes aspectos concernientes a la mastozoología Neotropical y con el factor humano que genera la presencialidad.",

            "abstractNote": "Mammals are among the most important species for ecosystems dynamics and functioning (Sinclair 2003, Schipper et al. 2008). However, they are currently threatened worldwide, with nearly 25% of all species under risk (Schipper et al. 2008). Protected areas are critical for conserving biodiversity (Chape et al. 2005), and are the last stronghold for preserving a complete representation of the world´s ecosystems (Powell et al. 2000, Rodrigues et al. 2004, Forero-Medina & Joppa 2010). Despite their importance in conserving biodiversity, still basic information is lacking for its effective management (Chape et al. 2005, Knight et al. 2008). Previous analyses have assessed the degree of effectiveness of protected areas from a macroecological perspective (Chape et al. 2005, Ceballos 2007, González-Maya et al. 2015), but for most Latin American countries, still basic information regarding basic biodiversity inventories, and especially from mammals is lacking;undermining effective and efficient protected areas management. For Colombia this is especially critical, since most protected areas still lack the most basic mammal information, from inventories to most other ecological management-relevant information. Here we present the most updated inventory of flying, medium and large mammals from Parque Nacional Natural Tayrona, Magdalena, Colombia.",

There were no signiﬁcant differences in postnatal growth rates between males and females on the basis of morphological changes. Body mass and forearm length followed a linear pattern of growth until 28 days of age at mean growth rates of 0.38 g/day and 1.15 mm/day, respectively and thereafter increased slowly. The length of total epiphyseal gap of the fourth metacarpal–phalangeal joint initially showed a linear increase for up to 16 days, followed by a linear decrease until day 46 at a mean rate of 0.18 mm/day. When forearm length was used in combination with changes in total epiphyseal gap length, we derived reliable age estimation equations for the 1–46 day age range. Of the three nonlinear growth models (logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy), the von Bertalanffy and logistic equations provided the best ﬁt to the empirical curves for body mass and forearm length, respectively. Studies of vocal development showed that infants could emit short calls as precursors of echolocation calls after birth. Isolation calls and precursors of echolocation calls were both characterized by multiple harmonics. We observed a systematic increase in the value of the starting frequency without a signiﬁcant change in the terminal frequency over the 3 week period of development. In addition, the duration of isolation calls increased until day 4 and then decreased, whereas, the duration of precursors of echolocation calls decreased continuously to reach a stable level.",

Tent construction by harem males to recruit females represents a heavy investment of time and effort, which is not done by nonharem males. The previously unobserved mode of harem formation by the solitary males was studied using mark-recapture and radio-telemetry. In our observation, the solitary males roosting near to harems started recruiting females by occupying the tent abandoned by the harems. This result suggests that the transition of nonharem male to harem male status possibly by a previously unobserved mode and the female recruitment is associated with resource (roost). It implies that the solitary males are actively involving in female recruitment and also presumably mating.",

Roosting behaviour and hunting activity over ponds of adult females and juveniles were monitored using radiotelemetry. Eighteen roosts were located, all in natural cavities. The bats occupied a limited number of trees located in a speciﬁc and small roosting area. This roost aggregation was not linked to the distribution of hollow trees. Furthermore, whereas all 11 ponds in the study area were exploited by Daubenton’s bats, monitored individuals were limited to two ponds to which they showed high ﬁdelity. These two ponds were not the closest to the roosting area. Overall, these results show that at least for the time we conducted our experiment, female and juvenile Daubenton’s bats are highly faithful to speciﬁc roosting and hunting grounds.",

Data were collected in April–September (1999–2005) using mist-netting and bat-detectors (n ¼ 209 samplings) in Slovakia (n ¼ 160 sites). For the habitat description, 17 environmental variables that characterised the sampling site, tree-species composition and general character of surrounding forest were selected. In study sites, altogether 93% of Slovak chiropterofauna species were recorded but only 16 species (2466 individuals) were recorded in more than 5% of samplings. The most common and frequent species were Myotis mystacinus (frequency of occurrence ¼ 57%, species dominance ¼ 12%) and Myotis myotis (44%, 10%), followed by Barbastella barbastellus (32%, 6%), Plecotus auritus (32%, 6%), Nyctalus noctula (31%, 9%) and Myotis brandtii (31%, 7%). Of the tested environmental variables used in CCA analysis, 13 had signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the species’ presence. On the base of gradients in ordination analysis, there were two main groups of species. In the ﬁrst ‘‘true’’ forest bats group the tree-dwelling and gleaning species Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis nattereri and P. auritus dominated. Their occurrence was connected mainly with old forests of natural tree-species composition. The second group comprised species, which foraged in more open space or along the forest edge (with the farmland) and avoided closed interior (particularly Eptesicus serotinus, N. noctula, Nyctalus leisleri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus). The presence of mountain species Eptesicus nilssonii and Vespertilio murinus was associated mainly with dominance of spruce. Suggested predictive modelling of species composition in forest bat assemblages in conditions of natural forests can help in nature conservation.",

In order to improve knowledge of the species' ecology and to provide tools for its conservation, we mapped each known day roost of a breeding population located at the western limits of the species' distribution and measured the shortest distance between the roosting sites and the foraging habitats. We also radio-tracked 7 females in different reproductive states in order to identify, to quantify the utilisation and to assess the biological importance of their nocturnal roosts. Our results revealed that the day roosts were located close to a large lake and that the bats roosted mainly in trees of a riparian forest during the night. Implications for the conservation of this bat species are discussed.",

Here we describe a bat assemblage from a savanna landscape in central Brazil and explore the richness, diversity, abundance and the influence of habitat and seasonality. We conducted 48 nights of sampling in both dry and wet seasons and in three habitat types. We estimated the richness and diversity indexes. We assessed the influence of habitat and season on species abundance with a generalized linear mixed model. Overall, we captured 254 individuals of 19 species and our effort sampled 90% of the estimated richness. The Phyllostomidae family was the most frequent, with 76.3% of all captures. Carollia perspicillata, Glossophaga soricina and Eptesicus furinalis were the most abundant species with 21.6%, 16.9% and 15.3% of captures, respectively. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the evenness were 2.37 and 0.80, respectively. Habitat and season interact to generate the observed abundance. The diversity was higher than what was observed for other bat assemblages in the Brazilian Cerrado. Our results sum up with ones previously described in the literature and highlight the importance of gallery forests for the maintenance of mammalian diversity in this biome. Additionally, the record of Trachops cirrhosus extends its geographic range approximately 300 km westward in the Cerrado.",

All were adult bats. Although we cannot control the occurrence of natural traps, we can suggest actions to mitigate negative effects of man-made structures. The most economic and effective way to mitigate these negative effects is to use plain wire to construct fences.",

With the exception of M. natalensis, R. simulator and Myo. tricolor, the other five species were recorded for the first time at Gatkop Cave during this time of the year, when thousands of M. natalensis use the cave as a maternity and nursery roost. Previously it was suggested the large numbers of M. natalensis using Gatkop Cave during the maternal period excluded other bat species. The reason for this recorded change in species roost composition at Gatkop Cave during the maternal period in relation to pre­ vious records made from the late 1960s and the mid 1980s is not clear, two possible reasons are the loss of other roosts, or these species were previously present but were not ­captured as a result of the particular methods used.",

In addition to nutrient availability, our model considered the capacity of this frugivorous bat to assimilate the nutrients present in the environment. We compared our predictions with bat captures obtained in the same urban parks, in which we measured nutrient availability. Our results show that A. jamaicensis densities were limited by the quantity of nitrogen available in urban parks. Our density-predicting models, based on soluble carbohydrates and fats available, overpredicted the number of A. jamaicensis individuals. Our result indicates that to maintain healthy bat populations in cities, it is important to take into account not only the variety of food available but also its nutrient content and how easy it is for the bat to assimilate them.",

We found that Sturnira lilium, a bat specialized in Solanum, was quite abundant. Despite this bat’s fruit preference, we observed a geographical diet shift at the genus level towards Piper, which we assert as evidence of opportunistic feeding. For S. lilium, frequently consumed food items such as Solanum umbellatum and Piper aduncum are associated with early vegetation succession, whereas other small-sized sympatric species of the genus Carollia feed mainly on P. aeruginosibaccum and Vismia camparaguey, typical elements of more mature stages. Resource partitioning is an important mechanism for species coexistence and community structuring.",

Hair samples were taken from the dorsal, ventral, and neck regions. Among the three pteropodids examined, an imbricate and tightly appressed hair type was observed in P. giganteus, while a coronal type of cuticle with margins diverging from the shaft was observed in R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx. The coronal cuticles of R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx had relatively thinner scale widths than the imbricate cuticles of P. giganteus. There was a significant difference in hair length, scale lengths and scale widths, and scale indices among the three species of fruit bats. However, there was no significant difference in hair length and scale index of male and female R. leschenaulti as well as in hair length and scale indices of male and female C. sphinx. The presence of bell-shaped coronal cuticle and wide angular scale margin in R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx reveal their role as active pollinators. The hair patterns, hair length, scale length and width confirm the presence of species-specific characteristics of pteropodid bats and can be used for species identification.",
