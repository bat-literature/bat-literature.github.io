            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous Old World horseshoe bats ( Rhinolophus spp.) are the likely source of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 prior to its spillover into humans and causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Natural coronavirus infections of bats appear to be principally confined to the intestines, suggesting fecal-oral transmission; however, little is known about the biology of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats. Previous experimental challenges of Egyptian fruit bats ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) resulted in limited infection restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas insectivorous North American big brown bats ( Eptesicus fuscus ) showed no evidence of infection. In the present study, we challenged Jamaican fruit bats ( Artibeus jamaicensis ) with SARS-CoV-2 to determine their susceptibility. Infection was confined to the intestine for only a few days with prominent viral nucleocapsid antigen in epithelial cells, and mononuclear cells of the lamina propria and Peyer's patches, but with no evidence of infection of other tissues; none of the bats showed visible signs of disease or seroconverted. Expression levels of ACE2 were low in the lungs, which may account for the lack of pulmonary infection. Bats were then intranasally inoculated with a replication-defective adenovirus encoding human ACE2 and 5 days later challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Viral antigen was prominent in lungs for up to 14 days, with loss of pulmonary cellularity during this time; however, the bats did not exhibit weight loss or visible signs of disease. From day 7, bats had low to moderate IgG antibody titers to spike protein by ELISA, and one bat on day 10 had low-titer neutralizing antibodies. CD4 + helper T cells became activated upon ex vivo recall stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid peptide library and exhibited elevated mRNA expression of the regulatory T cell cytokines interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β, which may have limited inflammatory pathology. Collectively, these data show that Jamaican fruit bats are poorly susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 but that expression of human ACE2 in their lungs leads to robust infection and an adaptive immune response with low-titer antibodies and a regulatory T cell-like response that may explain the lack of prominent inflammation in the lungs. This model will allow for insight of how SARS-CoV-2 infects bats and how bat innate and adaptive immune responses engage the virus without overt clinical disease.\nAUTHOR SUMMARY: Bats are reservoir hosts of many viruses that infect humans, yet little is known about how they host these viruses, principally because of a lack of relevant and susceptible bat experimental infection models. Although SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, no robust infection models of bats have been established. We determined that Jamaican fruit bats are poorly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2; however, their lungs can be transduced with human ACE2, which renders them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Despite robust infection of the lungs and diminishment of pulmonary cellularity, the bats showed no overt signs of disease and cleared the infection after two weeks. Despite clearance of infection, only low-titer antibody responses occurred and only a single bat made neutralizing antibody. Assessment of the CD4 + helper T cell response showed that activated cells expressed the regulatory T cell cytokines IL-10 and TGFβ that may have tempered pulmonary inflammation.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: The Ebola virus disease outbreak that started in Western Africa in 2013 was unprecedented because it spread within densely populated urban environments and affected many thousands of people. As a result, previous advice and guidelines need to be critically reviewed, especially with regard to transmission risks in different contexts.\nMETHODS: Scientific and grey literature were searched for articles about any African filovirus. Articles were screened for information about transmission (prevalence or odds ratios especially). Data were extracted from eligible articles and summarized narratively with partial meta-analysis. Study quality was also evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 31 reports were selected from 6552 found in the initial search. Eight papers gave numerical odds for contracting filovirus illness; 23 further articles provided supporting anecdotal observations about how transmission probably occurred for individuals. Many forms of contact (conversation, sharing a meal, sharing a bed, direct or indirect touching) were unlikely to result in disease transmission during incubation or early illness. Among household contacts who reported directly touching a case, the attack rate was 32% [95% confidence interval (CI) 26-38%]. Risk of disease transmission between household members without direct contact was low (1%; 95% CI 0-5%). Caring for a case in the community, especially until death, and participation in traditional funeral rites were strongly associated with acquiring disease, probably due to a high degree of direct physical contact with case or cadaver.\nCONCLUSIONS: Transmission of filovirus is unlikely except through close contact, especially during the most severe stages of acute illness. More data are needed about the context, intimacy and timing of contact required to raise the odds of disease transmission. Risk factors specific to urban settings may need to be determined.",

Here I identify a data set containing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from early in the Wuhan epidemic that has been deleted from the NIH9s Sequence Read Archive. I recover the deleted files from the Google Cloud, and reconstruct partial sequences of 13 early epidemic viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences in the context of carefully annotated existing data further supports the idea that the Huanan Seafood Market sequences are not fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the epidemic. Instead, the progenitor of currently known SARS-CoV-2 sequences likely contained three mutations relative to the market viruses that made it more similar to SARS-CoV-29s bat coronavirus relatives.</p>",

It describes roosting ecology or the significance of finding the right roost, and enumerates some of the potential benefits of choosing a suitable roost such as: protection from the weather and predators, reduced thermoregulation and commuting, and improved reproductive success and maternal care. It considers the enormous diversity of roosting behaviour by enumerating the general trends of bats. It illustrates the common locations on where bats roost, and investigates the behaviour ecology of roosting. It also briefly covers the basics of feeding behaviour of bats and highlights some methods such as insectivory, carnivory, piscivory, and sanguivory.",
