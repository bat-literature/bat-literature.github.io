These tradeoffs are critical when ES and EDS come from the same “provider”. Using bats as a provider example, we show how understanding tradeoffs between ES and EDS may assist in exploring management actions to mitigate human-bat conflicts and thus promote bat conservation. We used a socio-cultural approach consisting of focus groups and individual stakeholder interviews. People noticed more EDS than ES related to the presence of bats, mainly personal security (fear of attacks) and health (risk of disease transmission). Suppression of insect agricultural pests was the most frequently mentioned service. Incomplete and distorted information from mass media sources strongly influences people’s perceptions of bats. Avoiding human-bat contact may help counteract the fear, insecurity and unpleasantness people perceive from bats. Innovative management interventions, such as bat boxes and other artificial roosts, may help to favour bat conservation and their role in the agroecosystem, while other management actions (e.g., educational programs to reinforce ES) help balance ES and EDS tradeoffs. Nevertheless, balancing the tradeoffs in people’s perceptions of ES and EDS related to bats and collaboration among public and private institutions is necessary to facilitate conservation, management, and environmental education. Our findings recognise society’s challenges and how best to identify, protect, and conserve critical human and ecosystem health services in agroecosystems and human-modified landscapes.",

            "abstractNote": "Caves andother subterranean features provide unique environments for manyspecies. The importance of cave microclimate is particularly relevant at temperate latitudes where bats make seasonal use of caves for hibernation. White-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal disease that has devastated populations of hibernating bats across eastern and central North America, has brought renewed interest in bat hibernation and hibernaculum conditions. A recent review synthesized current understanding of cave climatology, exploring the qualitative relationship between cave and surface climate with implications for hibernaculum suitability. However, a more quantitative understanding of the conditions in which bats hibernate and how they may promote or mediate WNS impacts is required. We compiled subterranean temperatures from caves and mines across the western United States and Canada to (1) quantify the hypothesized relationship between mean annual surface temperature (MAST) and subterranean temperature and how it is inﬂuenced by measurable site attributes, and (2) use readilyavailable gridded data to predict and continuously map the range of temperatures that may be available in caves and mines. Our analysis supports qualitative predictions that subterranean winter temperatures are correlated with MAST, that temperatures are warmer and less variable farther from the surface, and that even deep within-cave temperatures tend to be lower than MAST. Effects of other site attributes (e.g., topography, vegetation, and precipitation) on subterranean temperatures were not detected. We then assessed the plausibility of model-predicted temperatures using knowledge of winter bat distributions and preferred hibernaculum temperatures.Ourmodelunavoidablysimpliﬁescomplexsubterraneanenvironmentsandisnotintendedtoexplain all variability in subterranean temperatures. Rather, our results offer researchers and managers improved broad-scale estimates of the geographic distribution of potential hibernaculum conditions compared to reliance on MASTalone. We expect this information to better support range-scale estimation of winter bat distributions and projection of likely WNS impacts across the west. We suggest that our model predictions should serve as hypotheses to be further tested and reﬁned as additional data become available.",

The champion of tongue length, Anoura fistulata, can extend its tongue to 150% of its body length, yet little is known about its interactions with flowers in the wild. Here we analyzed the diet of A. fistulata and co-occurring nectar bats in eight sites across Ecuador. Results demonstrate that, despite its phenotypic specialization, A. fistulata is no more ecologically specialized in its dietary breadth than co-occurring nectar bats. However, it prefers deeper flowers, and is the sole visitor to two species (Centropogon nigricans and Marcgravia williamsii) whose extremely deep flowers make their nectar inaccessible to other bats. Furthermore, A. fistulata only occurred in sites with at least one flower deeper than the tongue length of other nectar bats, suggesting it needs such a guaranteed nectar source to maintain a population. Finally, we found strong covariation across sites between the local tongue length of A. fistulata and the depth of the deepest flowers it visits. This suggests that the coevolutionary race that selected for the exceptional tongue length of this bat over time is also playing out in a geographic mosaic across space.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              The little brown bat (\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              ) is an endangered species that occurs throughout most of North America. The recovery strategy for little brown bats in Canada identifies a need to understand habitat use and protect important bat habitat across the species' Canadian range; however, bat roosting habitat requirements have not been well studied in mountainous environments within the northern part of the species' range. Our objective was to understand the use of building and natural roosts by female little brown bats in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Over two summers, we captured little brown bats in Banff, Yoho, and Kootenay National Parks, in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, and tracked 49 females to their day roosts. Buildings were the only roost type used by radio‐tagged bats of all reproductive stages, the dominant roost type used throughout the reproductive period, and the only structures in which we located maternity colonies. Buildings also appeared to shape the distribution of foraging female and reproductive female bats such that few were captured at long distances from towns and building clusters. Compared with bats in more southern and in non‐mountainous areas, bats in our study area had delayed juvenile weaning and volancy, began hibernation early, and had low reproductive rates. We suggest that buildings are a key habitat for female little brown bats to persist at their current levels in our study area, by providing thermal conditions that promote overwinter survival; additional reproductive delays caused by torpor use in cool natural roosts would likely reduce juvenile and adult female overwinter survival below the levels required to sustain populations. Nevertheless, building colonies were unusually small, and bats had relatively low fidelity to particular building roosts, suggesting that building roosts may not consistently meet bats' needs. Some nonreproductive and pregnant females also frequently used natural roosts, particularly after colder nights; these roosts may be important in facilitating torpor and energy conservation for these bats. Because bats are long‐lived with low reproductive output and low juvenile survival, addressing the needs of both reproductive and nonreproductive individuals is important for population persistence.",

I test his key prediction, the one upon which all the others rely: namely, that elevational range sizes of organisms get larger on mountains at increasing latitudes. My analyses use 170 montane gradients spanning 36.5° S to 48.2° N latitude compiled from over 80 years of research and 16 500 species of rodents, bats, birds, lizards, snakes, salamanders, and frogs. In support of JanzenÕs prediction, I ﬁnd that elevational range size increases with increasing latitude for all vertebrate groups except rodents. I document additional lines of evidence for temperature variability as a plausible mechanism for trends in vertebrate range size, including strong effects of thermoregulation and daily temperature variability, and a weak effect of precipitation.",

            "abstractNote": "Many applications in science and engineering involve data defined at specific geospatial locations, which are often modeled as random fields. The modeling of a proper correlation function is essential for the probabilistic calibration of the random fields, but traditional methods were developed with the assumption to have observations with evenly spaced data. Available methods dealing with irregularly spaced data generally require either interpolation or computationally expensive solutions. Instead, we propose a simple approach based on least square regression to estimate the autocorrelation function. We first tested our methodology on an artificially produced dataset to assess the performance of our method. The accuracy of the method and its robustness to the level of noise in the data indicate that it is suitable for use in realistic problems. In addition, the methodology was used on a major application, the modeling of animal species connected with zoonotic diseases. Understanding the population dynamics of reservoirs of zoonotic diseases, such as bats, is a crucial first step to predict and prevent potential spillover of deadly viruses like Ebola. Due to the limited data on bats across Africa, their density and migrations can only be studied with probabilistic numerical models based on samples of the ecological bare carrying capacity (K0). For this purpose, the bare carrying capacity was modeled as a random field and its statistics calibrated with the available data. The bare carrying capacity of bats was found to be denser in central Africa. This is because climatic and environmental conditions are more suitable for the survival of bats. The proposed methodology for random field calibration was shown to be a promising approach, which can cope with large gaps in data and with complex applications involving large geographical areas and high resolution.",

This study records the diversity of mammals in a private conservation area (PCA), thereby demonstrating its importance as a relict of little altered vegetation and as a refuge for mammalian species in an area threatened by accelerated human activities. From February to October 2012, by means of Sherman and Havahart traps, mist nets and camera traps, the diversity of mammals during the dry and rainy season was estimated. A total of 30 species, 23 genera, nine families and six orders were recorded. In terms of diversity, there is a signi cant di erence (p < 0.05) between the dry season (H'= 2.27) and the rainy season (H'= 2.12); however, regarding equitativity the dry season had a lower value (J'=0.70) compared to the rainy season (J'=0.74). Although the El Sagrado ranch PCA is not a large area, the number of documented species is relatively high. This paper is the  rst report about mammal diversity in the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca and represents an important contribution to our knowledge of mammals in Oaxaca.",

Morphology and functional similarity increase the potential for competition, and therefore, cooccurring morphologically similar but genetically unique species are a good model system for testing coexistence mechanisms. We used DNA metabarcoding and highthroughput sequencing to characterize for the first time the trophic ecology of two recently described cryptic bat species with parapatric ranges, Myotis escalerai and Myotis crypticus. We collected fecal samples from allopatric and sympatric regions and from syntopic and allotopic locations within the sympatric region to describe the diets both taxonomically and functionally and compare prey consumption with prey availability. The two bat species had highly similar diets characterized by high arthropod diversity, particularly Lepidoptera, Diptera and Araneae, and a high proportion of prey that is not volant at night, which points to extensive use of gleaning. Diet overlap at the prey item level was lower in syntopic populations, supporting trophic shift under fine-scale co-occurrence. Furthermore, the diet of M. escalerai had a marginally lower proportion of not nocturnally volant prey in syntopic populations, suggesting that the shift in diet may be driven by a change in foraging mode. Our findings suggest that fine-scale coexistence mechanisms can have implications for maintaining broad-scale diversity patterns. This study highlights the importance of including both allopatric and sympatric populations and choosing meaningful spatial scales for detecting ecological patterns. We conclude that a combination of high taxonomic resolution with a functional approach helps identify patterns of niche shift.",

Although estimating population density of bats using stationary acoustic detectors is key for evaluating environmental impacts, estimating densities from call activity data is only possible through recently developed numerical methods, as the recognition of calling individuals is impossible.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We tested the applicability of generalized random encounter models (gREMs) for determining population densities of three bat species (Common pipistrelle\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    , Northern bat\n                    Eptesicus nilssonii\n                    , and Natterer's bat\n                    Myotis nattereri\n                    ) based on passively collected acoustical data. To validate the results, we compared them to (a) density estimates from the literature and to (b) Royle–Nichols (RN) models of detection/nondetection data.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Our estimates for\n                    M. nattereri\n                    matched both the published data and RN‐model results. For\n                    E. nilssonii\n                    , the gREM yielded similar estimates to the RN‐models, but the published estimates were more than twice as high. This discrepancy might be because the high‐altitude flight of\n                    E. nilssonii\n                    is not accounted for in gREMs. Results of gREMs for\n                    P. pipistrellus\n                    were supported by published data but were ~10 times higher than those of RN‐models. RN‐models use detection/nondetection data, and this loss of information probably affected population estimates of very active species like\n                    P. pipistrellus\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  gREM models provided realistic estimates of bat population densities based on automatically recorded call activity data. However, the average flight altitude of species should be accounted for in future analyses. We suggest including flight altitude in the calculation of the detection range to assess the detection sphere more accurately and to obtain more precise density estimates.",

All species, except the nectarivore Monopiiyllus redmani, have a significant decrease in fat reserves during the dry season. In insectivorous bats, 9 9 generally have more fat than 9 8 during periods of maximal fat reserves; this difference normally disappears during the dry season. Bats with other food habits show no sexual dimorphism in fat deposition and appear to have smaller annual variations in the size of fat reserves. These data are compatible with the interpretation that insectivorous species face the greatest seasonal variation in food availability, which is derived from studies of the metabolism, temperature regulation, and reproduction of tropical bats. It is suggested that the tropical bats most likely to invade a temperate environment are those whose habits expose them to the most seasonal food supplies.",

Also, there is a global lack of knowledge on the vulnerability of tropical bat fauna due to wind energy production, even though it is well known that windpower can aﬀect bat communities and biodiversity hotspots are widespread in the tropics. We present one of the ﬁrst studies to quantify the indirect impact of wind farms on insectivorous bats in tropical hotspots of biodiversity. Bat activity was compared between wind farm sites and control sites, via ultrasound recordings at stationary points. The activity of bent winged bats (Miniopterus sp.) and wattled bats (Chalinolobus sp.) were both signiﬁcantly lower at wind turbine sites. The result of the study demonstrates a large eﬀect on bat habitat use at wind turbines sites compared to control sites. Bat activity was 20 times higher at control sites compared to wind turbine sites, which suggests that habitat loss is an important impact to consider in wind farm planning We strongly recommend that the loss of the foraging habitat loss is considered in mitigation hierarchy (avoiding, reducing, oﬀsetting) when compensating for negative impacts of wind farms.",

Though bats are one of the most threatened groups of European vertebrates, studies aiming to quantify bat mortality and determine the main factors driving it remain scarce. Between March 16 and October 31 of 2009, we surveyed road‐killed bats daily along a 51‐km‐long transect that incorporates different types of roads in southern Portugal. We found 154 road‐killed bats of 11 species. The two most common species in the study area,\n              Pipistrellus kuhlii\n              and\n              P. pygmaeus\n              , were also the most commonly identified road‐kill, representing 72 % of the total specimens collected. About two‐thirds of the total mortality occurred between mid July and late September, peaking in the second half of August. We also recorded casualties of threatened and rare species, including\n              Miniopterus schreibersii\n              ,\n              Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\n              ,\n              R. hipposideros\n              ,\n              Barbastella barbastellus\n              , and\n              Nyctalus leisleri\n              . These species were found mostly in early autumn, corresponding to the mating and swarming periods. Landscape features were the most important variable subset for explaining bat casualties. Road stretches crossing or in the vicinity of high‐quality habitats for bats—including dense Mediterranean woodland (“montado”) areas, water courses with riparian gallery, and water reservoirs—yielded a significantly higher number of casualties. Additionally, more road‐killed bats were recorded on high‐traffic road stretches with viaducts, in areas of higher bat activity and near known roosts.",

            "abstractNote": "The level of energy expenditure in eutherian mammals is correlated with the type of food consumed, especially in medium-sized to large species; some foods (including vertebrates, herbs, and nuts) permit high basal rates, while other foods (including invertebrates, fruit, and the leaves of woody plants) require low basal rates. Various properties of a food, including a low digestibility, a high content of plant secondary compounds, the inability to separate food from non-nutritive particles, and a seasonal reduction in availability, may require a consumer to have a low basal rate of metabolism; all of these factors are exaggerated in importance by the high food intake of large mammals. In small species most foods, except flying insects and seed crops in the desert, permit high basal rates and effective endothermy. Climatic factors modify these relationships to a limited extent, while a specialization in moderately-sized species to arboreal habits leads to reduced activity, smaller muscle mass, and lower basal rate than is found in terrestrial species using the same food resources. Mixed diets generally produce basal rates intermediate to those expected from the component specialist diets. The correlation of basal rate with food habits has the following demonstrable consequences for mammals. (1) The scaling of basal rate usually follows the Kleiber relation, unless food habits require low basal rates, or temperature regulation requires high rates. (2) Mammals that feed on foods associated with high basal rates have a higher reproductive output than mammals of similar size that use foods requiring low basal rates. (3) Predator avoidance is correlated with level of energy expenditure and food habits, terrestrial species with low rates of metabolism relying principally on burrows or passive integumental structures, such as shells, plates, or spines. (4) Most living \"conservative\" mammals use foods that require low basal rates of metabolism, a condition that protects conservative species from replacement by \"advanced\" eutherians, which are also required by these foods to have low basal rates.

To advise developers, we studied farming landscapes and compared bat activity at impacted sites (crops with wind turbines), sites without compensation measures (crops) and a set of sites with potential compensation measures: fallows, hedgerows, bushes, grass strips, and grass strips with bushes. Each site type was sampled twice in 2013, once during the reproductive period and once during the migratory period. Each sample consisted of at least eight nights of ultra-sound recordings. Bat species were separated into three groups: Pipistrellus sp., Eptesicus-Nyctalus sp. and Plecotus-Myotis sp. The results demonstrated that the three groups responded differently to the different potential compensation measures and that responses were season-dependent. These results lead to further questions regarding strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of wind farms.",

Much of the world now consists of a matrix of natural forests, managed forests, agricultural cropland, and urbanized plots. Expansion of domestic energy production efforts in the United States is one driver predicted to influence future land-use and land management practices across large spatial scales. Favorable growing conditions make the southeastern United States an ideal location for producing a large portion of the country’s renewable bioenergy. We investigated patterns of bat occurrence in two bioenergy feedstocks commonly grown in this region (corn, Zea mays, and pine, Pinus taeda and P. elliottii). We also evaluated potential impacts of the three major pathways of woody biomass extraction (residue removal following clearcut harvest, short-rotation energy plantations, and mid-rotation forest thinning) to bat occurrence through a priori land-use contrasts. We acoustically sampled bat vocalizations at 84 sites in the Southeastern Plains and Southern Coastal Plains of the southeastern United States across three years. We found that mid-rotation thinning resulted in positive effects on bat occurrence, and potential conversion of unmanaged (reference) forest to managed forest for timber and/or bioenergy harvest resulted in negative effects on bat occurrence when effects were averaged across all species. The effects of short-rotation energy plantations, removal of logging residues from plantation clearcuts, and corn were equivocal for all bat species examined. Our results suggest that accelerated production of biomass for energy production through either corn or intensively managed pine forests is not likely to have an adverse effect on bat communities, so long as existing older unmanaged forests are not converted to managed bioenergy or timber plantations. Beyond bioenergy crop production, mid-rotation thinning of even-aged pine stands intended for timber production, increases to the duration of plantation rotations to promote older forest stands, arranging forest stands and crop fields to maximize edge habitat, and maintaining unmanaged forests could benefit bat communities by augmenting roosting and foraging opportunities.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease that has resulted in severe declines of its hibernating bat hosts in North America. The ongoing epidemic of white-nose syndrome is a multi-scale phenomenon because it causes hibernaculum-level extirpations, while simultaneously spreading over larger spatial scales. We investigate a neglected topic in ecological epidemiology: how local pathogen-driven extirpations impact large-scale pathogen spread. Previous studies have identiﬁed risk factors for propagation of WNS over hibernaculum and landscape scales but none of these have tested the hypothesis that separation of spatial scales and disease-induced mortality at the hibernaculum level might slow or halt its spread. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mechanistic multi-scale model parameterized using white-nose syndrome county and site incidence data that connects hibernaculum-level susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemiology to the county-scale contagion process. Our key result is that hibernaculumlevel extirpations will not inhibit county-scale spread of WNS. We show that over 80% of counties of the contiguous USA are likely to become infected before the current epidemic is over and that geometry of habitat connectivity is such that host refuges are exceedingly rare. The macroscale spatiotemporal infection pattern that emerges from local SIR epidemiological processes falls within a narrow spectrum of possible outcomes, suggesting that recolonization, rescue effects, and multi-host complexities at local scales are not important to forward propagation of WNS at large spatial scales. If effective control measures are not implemented, precipitous declines in bat populations are likely, particularly in cave-dense regions that constitute the main geographic corridors of the USA, a serious concern for bat conservation.",

Studies on the reproductive biology of Neotropical bats indicate that the majority reproduce seasonally. This lead us to document this behaviour at the La Molina National Agrarian University campus, located in an urban area of the city of Lima, Peru. In order to recognise the reproductive patterns of the species, bats were captured from October 1995 to September of 1996. A total of 180 individuals was captured, comprising 4 species, pertaining to the Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae families. The most abundant species were Glossophaga soricina and Artibeus fraterculus. For these species, bimodal polyestric patterns are reported. Results reveal that both species follow this pattern and that the females of G. soricina . and A. fraterculus have at least one post - partum estrous period per year.",

However, the relative inﬂuence of birds and bats on insect populations and their indirect effects on leaf damage have not previously been investigated in tropical forest restoration sites. Leaf damage by herbivorous insects can negatively affect the growth and survival of tropical plants and thus can inﬂuence the success of tropical forest restoration efforts. We used an exclosure experiment to examine the top-down effects of birds and bats on insects and leaf damage in a large-scale forest restoration experiment. Given the potential inﬂuence of tree planting design on bird and bat abundances, we also investigated planting design effects on bird and bat insectivory and leaf damage. The experiment included two planting treatment plots: islands, where trees were planted in patches, and plantations, where trees were planted in rows to create continuous cover. In both types of plots, insect biomass was highest on tree branches where both birds and bats were excluded from foraging and lowest on branches without exclosures where both birds and bats were present. In the island plots, birds and bats had approximately equal impacts on insect populations, while in plantations bats appeared to have a slightly stronger effect on insects than did birds. In plantations, the levels of leaf damage were higher on branches where birds and bats were excluded than on branches where both had access. In island plots, no signiﬁcant differences in leaf damage were found between exclosure treatments although potential patterns were in the same direction as in the plantations. Our results suggest that both birds and bats play important roles as top predators in restoration systems by reducing herbivorous insects and their damage to planted trees. Tropical restoration projects should include efforts to attract and provide suitable habitat for birds and bats, given their demonstrated ecological importance.",

Previous studies have suggested physiological and ecological risk factors for infection in ﬂying-foxes, including physiological stress. However, little work has been done measuring and interpreting stress hormones in ﬂying-foxes. Over a 12month period, we collected pooled urine samples from underneath roosting ﬂying-foxes, and urine and blood samples from captured individuals. Urine and plasma samples were assayed for cortisol using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. We demonstrated a typical post-capture stress response in ﬂying-foxes, established urine speciﬁc gravity as an attractive alternative to creatinine to correct urine concentration, and established population-level urinary cortisol ranges (and geometric means) for the four Australian species: Pteropus alecto 0.5–305.1 ng/mL (20.1 ng/mL); Pteropus conspicillatus 0.3–370.9 ng/mL (18.9 ng/mL); Pteropus poliocephalus 0.3–311.3 ng/mL (10.1 ng/mL); Pteropus scapulatus 5.2–205.4 ng/mL (40.7 ng/mL). Geometric means differed signiﬁcantly except for P. alecto and P. conspicillatus. Our approach is methodologically robust, and has application both as a research or clinical tool for ﬂying-foxes, and for other free-living colonial wildlife species.",

We conducted a qualitative study in two districts of Bangladesh and interviewed 30 bat hunters who hunt bats primarily for consumption, to understand the process and their reasons for hunting bats and their perceptions about bats and bat-borne disease. Most hunters catch bats during winter nights, using a net. Bat meat is used for household consumption, and the surplus is sold to cover household expenditures. They prepare the bat meat at home to sell it in their own and in neighboring communities. They also sell live bats to traditional healers. They report that the bat population has declined compared with 5 or 10 years ago, a decline they attribute to hunting and deforestation. Many have heard of a disease from bat-contaminated date palm sap but do not believe that bats can spread such disease to humans. Close bat–human interaction reported in this study pose a risk of pathogen spillover. Conservation initiatives have the potential to reduce such interaction and so both reduce disease risk and support the ecology.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats of the genus Pteropus (Pteropodidae) are recognised as the natural host of multiple emerging pathogenic viruses of animal and human health signiﬁcance, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses and ebolaviruses. Some studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may be associated with Hendra virus infection in ﬂying-foxes in Australia; however, it is essential to understand the normal range and seasonal variability of physiological biomarkers before seeking physiological associations with infection status. We aimed to measure a suite of physiological biomarkers in P. alecto over time to identify any seasonal ﬂuctuations and to examine possible associations with life-cycle and environmental stressors. We sampled 839 adult P. alecto in the Australian state of Queensland over a 12-month period. The adjusted population means of every assessed hematologic and biochemical parameter were within the reported reference range on every sampling occasion. However, within this range, we identiﬁed signiﬁcant temporal variation in these parameters, in urinary parameters and body condition, which primarily reﬂected the normal annual life cycle. We found no evident effect of remarkable physiological demands or nutritional stress, and no indication of clinical disease driving any parameter values outside the normal species reference range. Our ﬁndings identify underlying temporal physiological changes at the population level that inform epidemiological studies and assessment of putative physiological risk factors driving Hendra virus infection in P. alecto. More broadly, the ﬁndings add to the knowledge of Pteropus populations in terms of their relative resistance and resilience to emerging infectious disease.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome is caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans and has killed millions of hibernating bats in North America but the pathophysiology of the disease remains poorly understood. Our objectives were to (1) assess non-destructive diagnostic methods for P. destructans infection compared to histopathology, the current gold-standard, and (2) to evaluate potential metrics of disease severity. We used data from three captive inoculation experiments involving 181 little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to compare histopathology, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and ultraviolet ﬂuorescence as diagnostic methods of P. destructans infection. To assess disease severity, we considered two histology metrics (wing area with fungal hyphae, area of dermal necrosis), P. destructans fungal load (qPCR), ultraviolet ﬂuorescence, and blood chemistry (hematocrit, sodium, glucose, pCO2, and bicarbonate). Quantitative PCR was most effective for early detection of P. destructans, while all three methods were comparable in severe infections. Correlations among hyphae and necrosis scores, qPCR, ultraviolet ﬂuorescence, blood chemistry, and hibernation duration indicate a multistage pattern of disease. Disruptions of homeostasis occurred rapidly in late hibernation. Our results provide valuable information about the use of non-destructive techniques for monitoring, and provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of white-nose syndrome, with implications for developing and implementing potential mitigation strategies.",

Little is known about the reproductive biology of this bat. Both sexes roost separately except during January to March. The breeding season is however not well defined. This study was designed to investigate different morphological and histological changes in different months of the year in order to determine the actual period when male bats were reproductively active, along with seasonal changes in the spermatogenic activity of this bat. For this purpose, a group of 9 bat species of S. heathii were captured from different areas of Faisalabad in different months of the year. Morphometric measurements of each bat were made by digital Vernier caliper in order to confirm about the exact specie. Tests were taken and their different morphological parameters were taken. Histology of the testes was studied to explore various stages of spermatogenesis using different histological techniques like Fixation, Dehydration, Sectioning, Staining, and preservation. Histomorphometric measurements were also made by image J analysis. All parameter values were taken as Mean±SE. By using one way ANOVA and Fischer LSD the obtained data was analyzed, which showed highly significant values of all parameters, P<0.005. In this study, the morphological parameters and histological parameters were observed, which showed lowest values of all parameters except lumen area, in February and March, which was non spermatogenic period. In September, parameters showed low spermatogenic activity. In November all parameters were at their maximum value, which indicating the peak spermatogenic period for this bat. These results suggest the occurrence of an annual testicular cycle defined by three distinct reproductive periods.",

            "abstractNote": "A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand whether ecological communities are structured according to general assembly rules or are essentially dictated by random processes. In the context of fragmentation, understanding assembly patterns and their mechanistic basis also has important implications for conservation. Using distribution data of 20 bat species collected on 11 islands in Gatún Lake, Panama, we tested for non-randomness in presence–absence matrices with respect to nestedness and negative species co-occurrence. We examined the causal basis for the observed patterns and conducted separate analyses for the entire assemblage and for various species submatrices reﬂecting differences in species’ trophic position and mobility. Furthermore, we explored the inﬂuence of weighting factors (area, isolation, abundance) on co-occurrence analyses. Unweighted analyses revealed a signiﬁcant negative co-occurrence pattern for the entire assemblage and for phytophagous bats alone. Weighting analyses by isolation retained a pattern of species segregation for the whole assemblage but nulliﬁed the non-random structure for phytophagous bats and suggested negative associations for animalivores and species with low mobility. Area- and abundance-weighted analyses always indicated random structuring. Bat distributions followed a nested subset structure across islands, regardless of whether all species or different submatrices were analysed. Nestedness was in all cases unrelated to island area but weakly correlated with island isolation for incidence matrices of all species, phytophagous bats, and mobile species. Overall, evidence for negative interspeciﬁc interactions indicative of competitive effects was weak, corroborating previous studies based on ecomorphological analyses. Our ﬁndings indicate that bat assemblages on our study islands are most strongly shaped by isolation effects and species’ differential movement and colonization ability. From a conservation viewpoint this suggests that even in systems with high fragment–matrix contrast, a purely area-based approach may be inadequate, and structural and functional connectivity among patches are important to consider in reserve planning.",

The unexpected sister–taxon relationship between rhinolophoid microbats and megabats, with the exclusion of other microbats, suggests that megabats arose in a relatively short period of time from a microbat-like ancestor. In order to understand the genetic mechanism underlying adaptive evolution in megabats, we determined the wholegenome sequences of two rousette megabats, Leschenault’s rousette (Rousettus leschenaultia) and the Egyptian fruit bat (R. aegyptiacus). The sequences were compared with those of 22 other mammals, including nine bats, available in the database. We identified that megabat genomes are distinct in that they have extremely low activity of SINE retrotranspositions, expansion of two chemosensory gene families, including the trace amine receptor (TAAR) and olfactory receptor (OR), and elevation of the dN/dS ratio in genes for immunity and protein catabolism. The adaptive signatures discovered in the genomes of megabats may provide crucial insight into their distinct evolution, including key processes such as virus resistance, loss of echolocation, and frugivorous feeding.",

In the face of climate change, many of these species are being pushed higher to escape ever-­increasing temperatures. Despite this, we have little understanding of how species distribute themselves across mountains. African mountains in particular are less studied than mountains elsewhere and the small mammal groups that inhabit them are also poorly studied when compared to other groups. In this study, we examined the responses of three functionally distinct small mammal taxonomic groups to changes in elevation across Africa.",

Following the PRISMA standard systematic review protocols, we conducted a comprehensive search worldwide for scientific papers dealing with bathosted viruses of the Adenoviridae and Herpesviridae families. The search was completed using the Scopus, CABI, and SciELO, databases of bat-associated viruses of these two families as well as the Google Scholar search engine. Our search comprised a total of 2656 scientific papers. After a thorough review and screening of the papers, we selected for our study a total of 90 papers published between 1996 and 2022. We found marked taxonomic and spatial biases, the most studied bats being predominantly vespertilionids, rhinolophids, phyllostomids, and pteropodids, whereas other families (e.g., Natalidae, Noctilionidae, and Furipteridae) are still lacking information. The most studied areas are southern and east Asia, although there are large areas (north Africa, the Middle East, and all the way to central or northern Asia) still overlooked. Out of the total number of papers, as many as 55 identified bat-hosted Adenovirus (AdV) and 54 papers identified Herpesvirus (HSV). Our revision reveals the presence of AdVs in a total of 97 bat species from 42 genera and 11 families. The presence of HSVs is reported also in 109 bat species from 45 genera and 10 families. Although both AdVs and HSVs in general show a clear host specificity and parallel evolution with their hosts, these results also point to the potential of these viruses to cross, in some cases, species barriers.",

We combined the existing literature, museum accessions, and database occurrences with new observations from bioinventory efforts conducted in 2018–2022 to generate an updated list of troglobiotic and stygobiotic species for the Fern Cave System. Our list of cave-limited fauna totals twenty-seven species, including nineteen troglobionts and eight stygobionts. Two pseudoscorpions are endemic to the Fern Cave System: Tyrannochthonius torodei and Alabamocreagris mortis. The exceptional diversity at Fern Cave is likely associated with several factors, such as the high dispersal potential of cave fauna associated with expansive karst exposures along the Southern Cumberland Plateau, high surface productivity, organic input from a large bat colony, favorable climate throughout the Pleistocene, and location within a larger regional hotspot of subterranean biodiversity. Nine species are of conservation concern, including the recently discovered Alabama cave shrimp Palaemonias alabamae, because of their small range sizes, few occurrences, and several potential threats.",

            "abstractNote": "Current taxonomical keys are essential for better biodiversity knowledge. Moreover, accurate identiﬁcation of groups of organisms known to act as disease vectors is vital in today’s world of change and the spread of zoonotic disease threats. This is especially relevant to bats and their parasites, given the events of recent years. The available keys of European Nycteribiidae (Diptera) are outdated and do not cover all the species currently known from Europe. Therefore, a summary key of 16 European species is provided in this paper. Based on published data from Europe, a total of 173 host–parasite interactions were observed between 16 European bat ﬂy species and 31 host species (bats). The highest number of associations with different host species and the lowest specialization was observed in Penicillidia (P.) dufourii dufourii, followed by Nycteribia (N.) kolenatii, N. (N.) schmidlii and Phthiridium biarticulatum; most of the other species also had low specialization. Most species are oligoxenous, parasitizing on several families, and three species are stenoxenosus. Only one nycteribiid species, Basilia daganiae, was linked with only one host (Pipistrellus kuhlii). Myotis myotis has 12 associations with different bat ﬂy species, followed by Plecotus auritus and Myotis daubentonii with 12 associations. A relatively high number of bat species were associated with only one bat ﬂy species. In addition, we performed a bipartite analysis complemented by network indices and host speciﬁcity at the species and whole network levels, yielding new information in terms of ecology and the host–parasite relationships related to these groups of potential vectors (Nycteribiidae) and sources of zoonoses (bats). The parasite–host network composed of 16 nycteribiid species and 31 bat host species was characterized by a low network level specialization, low modularity, and low nestedness. Our ﬁndings also suggest a high probability of associated Nycteribiidae in bat taxa with a similar roosting ecology and phylogenetic relationship.",

            "abstractNote": "In North America, bat research eﬀorts largely have focused on summer maternity colonies and winter hibernacula, leaving the immediate pre- and post-hibernation ecology for many species unstudied. Understanding these patterns and processes is critical for addressing potential additive impacts to White-nose Syndrome (WNS)-aﬀected bats, as autumn is a time of vital weight gain and fat resources are largely depleted in early spring in surviving individuals. Our study sought to examine autumn and spring bat activity patterns in the central Appalachian Mountains around three hibernacula to better understand spatio-temporal patterns during staging for hibernation and post-hibernation migration in the post-WNS environment. From early September through November 2015 and 2016, and from early March through April 2016 and 2017, we assessed the eﬀects of distance to hibernacula and ambient conditions on nightly bat activity for Myotis spp. and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) using zero-crossing frequency division bat detectors near cave entrances and 1 km, 2 km, and 3 km distant from caves. Following identiﬁcation of echolocation calls, we used generalized linear mixed eﬀects models to examine patterns of activity across the landscape over time and relative to weather. Overall bat activity was low at all sample sites during autumn and spring periods except at sites closest to hibernacula. Best-supported models describing bat activity varied, but date and ambient temperatures generally appeared to be major drivers of activity in both seasons. Total activity for all species had largely ceased by mid-November. Spring bat activity was variable across the sampling season, however, some activity was observed as early as mid-March, almost a month earlier than the historically accepted emergence time regionally. Current timing of restrictions on forest management activities that potentially remove day-roosts near hibernacula when bats are active on the landscape may be mismatched with actual spring post-hibernation emergence. Adjustments to the timing of these restrictions during the spring may help to avoid potentially additive negative impacts on WNS-impacted bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Knowing how adaptation shapes morphological evolution is fundamental to understanding the processes that promote biological diversity. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the effects of adaptive radiations on phenotypic diversity, which is related to processes that promote phenotypic divergence and convergence. We applied comparative methods to identify shifts in adaptive peaks and to detect divergence and convergence in skull morphology of frugivorous bats (Phyllostomidae: Stenodermatinae and Carollinae), an ecologically diverse group with strong association between skull morphology, feeding performance and diet that suggests adaptive diversiﬁcation through morphological innovation. We found divergence and convergence for skull morphology. Fifteen peak shifts were found for jaws, which result in four convergent and four divergent regimes. For skull, nine peak shifts were detected that result in three convergent and three divergent regimes. Furthermore, convergence was signiﬁcant and strong for skull morphology since distantly related organisms converged to the same adaptive optima. Results suggest that convergence indicates the effect of restriction on phenotypes to keep the advantages provided by the skull phenotype that played a central role in the evolution of strict frugivory in phyllostomids. We conclude that convergence has limited phenotypic diversity of functional traits related to feeding in phyllostomid frugivores.",

Habitat fragmentation has proven to be detrimental to population sustainability of several species, and is the subject of intense study with often species and latitude specific responses. We compared both coarse land area classes and landscape fragmentation metrics from six 30 km × 30 km subsets centered on publicly owned management areas to bat captures obtained from a 2005 population study. Patch density was the strongest predictor of total captures (R2 = 0.801, p = 0.016) and of Myotis austroriparius captures (R2 = 0.856, p = 0.008). Our findings indicate that patch density and area are important predictors of bottomland bat captures.",

            "abstractNote": "Kaeng Khoi virus (KKV; Order: Bunyavirales), is an endemic viral infection of the wrinklelipped free-tailed bat (Chaerephon plicatus aka Tadarida plicata plicata). Little is known about the ecology and maintenance of KKV within the bat population, nor the infection dynamics and transmission among bats or between bats and other vertebrates. Therefore, KKV was studied in Kaeng Khoi cave, Saraburi province, Thailand, during 1973–1974 with the objectives to (1) characterize the seasonal infection rates of KKV in the context of the bat population ecology, and (2) describe the infection dynamics and viral shedding by naturally- and experimentally-infected bats. To this end, the freetailed bat population was estimated by a series of timed photographs taken during the evening exodus. The case population of 900,000 adult bats doubled at the time of weaning of the young and returned to its previous level soon thereafter. The newborn bats had neutralizing antibodies to KKV that were likely to be maternal in origin. The KKV antibody prevalence in adult bats was high (69–91%) in March–May and low (29–40%) in August and September. Kaeng Khoi virus was isolated from 75% of dead and 50% of moribund bats, but was not found in nearly 400 apparently healthy bats. Virus was present in saliva, urine and blood of most of the naturally-moribund bats tested. Consistent with observations from naturally-infected bats, experimental infection of bats with KKV revealed signiﬁcant liver pathology, also suggestive that this is not a benign infection. Kaeng Khoi virus is an endemic, year-round infection maintained by the annual recruitment of a large number of immunologically-naïve juvenile bats. Moreover, it produces an acute infection in the bat, either leading to death by hepatitis, or immunity.",

The chromosome corresponding to No. 5 in the <i>M</i>. <i>ater </i>karyotype is discussed. We suggest that the <i>Nyctinomops </i>and <i>Molossops </i>karyotypes represent the primitive condition and that <i>Molossus </i>and <i>Eumops </i>have derived karyotypes.",

            "abstractNote": "To reproduce, males have to fertilize the female’s eggs, sometimes in competition with ejaculates of other males. In species where males display alternative reproductive tactics, whereby territorial males secure mating and non-territorial males have to sneak copulations, the latter might be expected to invest relatively more resources towards sperm quality compared with the territorial males. Sperm cells are especially vulnerable to oxidative stress, which reduces male fertility. Therefore, antioxidant resources are expected to modulate sperm quality, and might be allocated differently between reproductive tactics. To test the link between reproductive tactics, redox proﬁle and sperm quality, we experimentally induced changes in the reproductive tactics of 39 captive males Seba’s short-tailed bats Carollia perspicillata. We monitored the blood and ejaculate oxidative balance, and the sperm quality before, 7 days and 21 days after the manipulation of reproductive tactic. Although ejaculates’ oxidative damage was negatively related to sperm velocity, males exhibited similar blood and ejaculates redox proﬁles and similar sperm quality, regardless of their reproductive tactic. Possibly, these results arise as a consequence of some constraints having been lifted during the experiment. Our results also suggest that, in Seba’s short-tailed bats, the expression of alternative reproductive tactics is not subjected to strong oxidative constraints. Furthermore, our results could reﬂect an absence of trade-off between pre- and post-copulatory traits in harem males, as they could be selected to invest both in female attraction and sperm quality, as a consequence of their inability to fully monopolize females.",

The virus, which was initially restricted to East and Central Africa, is now emerging in West Africa. Ecological aspects of Ebola virus diseases are poorly understood. It is suspected that the virus is circulating in the forests of Africa, mostly hosted by migratory bats, which spread the virus to other wildlife particularly great apes and duikers. Spillovers occur when humans have contacts with wildlife. Transmission of the virus within human systems occurs through contacts with body fluids of an infected person. Several factors seem to be responsible for the emergence and re-emergence of the virus in Africa including circulation of the virus in forest ecosystems, persistence of the virus in body fluids (during sickness, upon death, and in survivors), transmission through diverse routes (direct contacts, fomites, oral), presence of infected migratory bats and other wildlife species, forest encroachment, and climatic and seasonal changes.",

            "abstractNote": "We face an increasing global food security challenge as the human population continues to grow across the globe. As agricultural production rises to keep up with food demand, so too does the expansion of crop detrimental pest species. Early detection can be crucial to control their damage and relies on the use of accurate and dependable techniques. We report the first record of rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus) in the Iberian Peninsula. The distribution range expansion of this invasive rice pest weevil is confirmed through traditional sampling and through natural sampling by bats combined with DNA metabarcoding, a non-invasive technique with strong potential for early detection of pests in agricultural areas. Presence of rice water weevil was confirmed geneti­ cally from bat faecal samples collected from a Pipistrellus pygmaeus bat roost in the Ebro Delta (Catalonia, Spain). The known distribution of this rice pest, native to North America, now includes four of the top five riceproducing European countries. To date, the economic damage caused by this pest in Europe is minimal and concentrated in small areas, but chemical and agronomic controls are implemented to control their populations. The nature of this record highlights the potential of insectivorous bats as natural samplers to detect (and possibly control) pest species in crops. Further studies are required to determine the full extent of the rice water weevil’s spread, and to investigate integrated pest management systems, including biological control to suppress their populations.",

Cryogenic succuss has been linked to membrane composition, therefore the lipid composition of ﬁve Pteropus species sperm acrosomal and plasma membranes were investigated to provide insight into reasons for cold shock susceptibility. Rapid chilling and re-warming of spermatozoa from three Pteropus species resulted in a decrease (P < 0.05) in acrosomal integrity. Biochemical analysis of lipids revealed that stearic acid (18:0) was the predominant saturated fatty acid and oleic acid (18:1, n-9) the predominant unsaturated fatty acid in both acrosomal and plasma membranes. Linolenic acid (18:3, n-3) was only detected in plasma membranes of Pteropus hypomelanus and was detected in acrosomal membranes of all Pteropus spp. studied (except Pteropus giganteus). Although detected in both plasma and acrosomal membranes of Pteropus vampyrus, docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) was not detected at all in Pteropus poliocephalus, only in trace levels in the acrosomal and plasma membranes of P. giganteus and P. hypomelanus and not in acrosomal membranes of Pteropus rodricensis. No difference was seen in the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within plasma membranes, however PUFAs were lower (P < 0.05) in acrosomal membranes of P. giganteus compared with P. vampyrus. Pteropus spp. spermatozoa have a very low ratio of unsaturated/saturated membrane fatty acids (<0.5). Membranes containing more PUFAs are more ﬂuid, so the use of cryogenic media which improves membrane ﬂuidity should improve Pteropus spp. spermatozoal viability post-thaw.",

Together with sound diagnostic methods and efﬁcacious vaccines—both of which had been available for many decades, an understanding of the epidemiology of the disease have enabled its control and even elimination in some speciﬁc reservoir species in North America and Western Europe. However, worldwide rabies still radiates into new host species and geographical domains and has become vastly underestimated throughout the developing world through lack of awareness, apathy and poor surveillance. As a result, this disease is now more of a global public and veterinary health threat than it has ever been.",

Thirteen polymorphic (tri, tetra- and pentanucleotide) microsatellites were developed and tested. All markers were genotyped on 42 different individuals from 5 distinct locations. We observed low to medium–high genetic variation across most loci. Levels of expected heterozygosity across all markers was medium to low (mean HE = 0.659, mean HO = 0.672).",

Daily mean roost temperature was 12.9 ± 4.9◦C SD in bridges and 11.0 ± 4.6◦C in accessible cavities with daily fluctuations of 4.8 ± 2◦C in bridges and 4.0 ± 1.9◦C in accessible cavities and maximum fluctuations of 13.8 and 10.5◦C, respectively. Mean torpor bout duration was 2.7 ± 2.8 days and was negatively related to ambient temperature and positively related to precipitation. Bats maintained non-random arousal patterns focused near dusk and were active on 33.6% of tracked days. Fifty-one percent of arousals contained passive rewarming. Normothermic bout duration, general activity and activity away from the roost were positively related to ambient temperature, and activity away from the roost was negatively related to barometric pressure. Our results suggest ambient weather conditions influence winter torpor patterns of tricolored bats using thermally unstable roosts. Short torpor bout durations and potential nighttime foraging during winter by tricolored bats in thermally unstable roosts contrasts with behaviors of tricolored bats in thermally stable roosts. Therefore, tricolored bat using thermally unstable roosts may be less susceptible to WNS. More broadly, these results highlight the importance of understanding the effect of roost thermal stability on winter torpor patterns and the physiological flexibility of broadly distributed hibernating species.",

Here we report the isolation of eight new microsatellite markers which will be employed to investigate ultimate causes and consequences of sex-biased dispersal by use of paternity, relatedness and population structure analyses. Novel microsatellite markers developed for the species Rhynchonycteris naso turned out to be highly polymorphic. Number of alleles ranged from seven to 31 alleles per locus and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.74 to 0.95. Seven loci were autosomal and one locus appeared to be situated on the X-Chromosome. Cross-species ampliﬁcation in four species was more successful in more closely related than in more distantly related genera of neotropical emballonurids. Together with other eleven microsatellites initially isolated for Saccopteryx bilineata, we now posses powerful tools for studying species of the two bat genera, Saccopteryx and Rhynchonycteris.",

This M¯aori (New Zealanders of indigenous descent) saying conveys the principle of cooperation—we achieve more through working together, rather than separately. Despite decades of calls to rectify cultural imbalance in conservation, threatened species management still relies overwhelmingly on ideas from Western science and on top-down implementation. Values-based approaches to decision making can be used to integrate indigenous peoples’ values into species conservation in a more meaningful way. We used such a values-based method, structured decision making, to develop comanagement of pekapeka (Mystacina tuberculata) (short-tailed bat) and tara iti (Sternula nereis davisae) (Fairy Tern) between M¯aori and P¯akeh¯a (New Zealanders of European descent). We implemented this framework in a series of workshops in which facilitated discussions were used to gather expert knowledge to predict outcomes and make management recommendations. For both species, stakeholders clearly stated their values as fundamental objectives from the start, which allowed alternative strategies to be devised that naturally addressed their diverse values, including m¯atauranga M¯aori (M¯aori knowledge and perspectives). On this shared basis, all partners willingly engaged in the process, and decisions were largely agreed to by all. Most expectations of conflicts between values of Western science and M¯aori culture were unfounded. Where required, positive compromises were made by jointly developing alternative strategies. The values-based process successfully taha wairua taha tangata (brought both worlds together to achieve the objective) through codeveloped recovery strategies. This approach challenges the traditional model of scientists first preparing management plans focused on biological objectives, then consulting indigenous groups for approval. We recommend valuesbased approaches, such as structured decision making, as powerful methods for development of comanagement conservation plans between different peoples.",

            "abstractNote": "Time is of the essence in conservation biology. To secure the persistence of a species, we need to understand how to balance time spent among different management actions. A new and simple method to test the efficacy of a range of conservation actions is required. Thus, we devised a general theoretical framework to help determine whether to test a new action and when to cease a trial and revert to an existing action if the new action did not perform well. The framework involves constructing a general population model under the different management actions and specifying a management objective. By maximizing the management objective, we could generate an analytical solution that identifies the optimal timing of when to change management action. We applied the analytical solution to the case of the Christmas Island pipistrelle bat (Pipistrelle murrayi), a species for which captive breeding might have prevented its extinction. For this case, we used our model to determine whether to start a captive breeding program and when to stop a captive breeding program and revert to managing the species in the wild, given that the management goal is to maximize the chance of reaching a target wild population size. For the pipistrelle bat, captive breeding was to start immediately and it was desirable to place the species in captivity for the entire management period. The optimal time to revert to managing the species in the wild was driven by several key parameters, including the management goal, management time frame, and the growth rates of the population under different management actions. Knowing when to change management actions can help conservation managers’ act in a timely fashion to avoid species extinction.",

We analyzed a database that contained information on the year of description, distribution, size class, and taxonomic order of each known mammalian species. Our goal was to predict the size class, order, and number of mammalian species on each of four land masses—America, Eurasia, Africa, Oceania. We constructed cumulative functions of species described versus year of description, and we fitted a logarithmic model to calculate instantaneous rates of species description in 1992 and 2032 and to estimate the number of species to be described in each group in the 40-year interval. Africa and Eurasia had the highest absolute number of species today and the greatest number of species expected to be described in species-rich orders (except for Rodentia, in which the highest number of known and expected species was in the American land mass). Per unit area, Oceania had the highest number of known species and the greatest number of species expected to be described. Our estimates, based on the historical patterns of species accumulation, place the total number of mammalian species in the year 2032 at 4875, which is 247 more than in 1992. The majority of the new species will be small (Ͻ100 g) and will be in the orders Insectivora, Chiroptera, and Rodentia. Our analyses will help identify particular groups and land masses for which field surveys, conservation efforts, and taxonomic study deserve particular attention.",

Ten of 14 (71%) were infected with 1 or more parasites as follows: 3 of 4 (75%) E. fuscus, 3 of 6 (50%) M. lucifugus, and 3 of 4 (75%) M. ciliolabrum harbored the lecithodendrid trematode Paralecithodendrium swansoni; 1 of 4 (25%) E. fuscus, 1 of 6 (17%) M. lucifugus, and 1 of 4 (25%) M. ciliolabrum were infected with a plagiorchid trematode, Plagiorchis vespertilionis; and a single E. fuscus (25%) harbored third-stage larval spirurid nematode Physaloptera sp. This is the ﬁrst time P. vespertilionis and P. swansoni have been reported from M. ciliolabrum. In addition, E. fuscus is a new host for Physaloptera sp., and P. swansoni is now documented in Nebraska.",

The bat flies were identified as Penicilidia jenynsii (PJ; n = 45), Nycteribia allotopa (NA; n = 157), and novel Nycteribia species (NS; n = 79). Bartonella DNAs were detected in 31.7 % (89/281) of bat flies by PCR targeting the citrate synthase (gltA) gene. The prevalence of Bartonella DNA among the bat flies was 47.1 % (74/157) in NA, 15.2 % (12/79) in NS, and 6.7 % (3/45) in PJ. Bartonella bacteria were also isolated from two NA and one NS. A phylogenetic analysis of the gltA sequences revealed that bat fly-associated strains were classified into three lineages and the same lineages of Bartonella were commonly detected from both Nycteribia bat flies and Miniopterus bats. These results suggest that Nycteribia bat flies are potential vectors for transmitting Bartonella among Miniopterus bats.",

Using a conventional PCR protocol targeting a fragment of the ITS region, 21 bats (38 %) were positive for DNA of Bartonella sp. Molecular characterization of fragments of the gltA, rpoB and fstZ genes and subsequent phylo­ genetic analysis indicated the presence of diverse genotypes related to Bartonella from bats worldwide. DNA from C. burnetii was investigated using a real-time PCR (qPCR) protocol targeting the IS1111 gene and yielded positive results for 5 individuals (9%), being the first report of C. burnetii in wildlife in Chile. All bats were negative for Rickettsia sp., evaluated by qPCR for the gltA gene, confirming that bats do not act as important reservoirs for Rickettsia. This preliminary survey calls for more comprehensive studies on the epidemiology of these agents, including larger sample sizes, the evaluation of potential transmission routes and spillover potential.",

Yet, cursorial mammals are unable to support high intensity exercise with fat stores. We hypothesized that migratory bats and birds have converged on similar physiological mechanisms to fuel endurance ﬂight with fat. We predicted bats would seasonally upregulate fatty acid transport and oxidation pathways when migration demands were high. We studied seasonal variation in mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activities and fatty acid transport protein expression in the ﬂight muscle of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). Carnitine palmitoyl transferase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activity increased during migration. There were no changes in expression of fatty acid translocase or plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein. Heart-type fatty acid binding protein expression increased 5-fold in migrating females, but did not vary seasonally in males. An aerial insectivore lifestyle, and the coincidence of migration and pregnancy may explain differences in transporter expression compared to previously studied birds. Overall, our results are consistent with seasonal upregulation of lipid metabolism and aerobic capacity, and conﬁrm that migration poses distinct physiological challenges for bats.",

Such essential nutrients are vitamin A, vitamin E and selected carotenoids as vitamin-A-precursors. Because their blood plasma concentration are valid biomarkers of nutritional status of dietary intake, we determined the concentrations of carotenoids, retinol and α-tocopherol by HPLC as well as the transport proteins for retinol, the retinol-binding protein (RBP) and transthyretin (TTR) immunologically in the plasma of six species of microchiroptera from free-ranging animals and compared it in one species (Carollia perspicillata) to a group held in captivity. Plasma concentrations of the investigated components were generally much lower compared to most other mammals. Within the bats, differences were observed for all components. As in other species retinol, RBP and TTR were present but no retinyl esters could be detected. Plasma of the insectivorous bat species Molossus molossus contained carotenoids. Within the group of carotenoids, β-carotene was dominant and only traces of lutein were present. Phyllostomus hastatus revealed the highest α-tocopherol concentration. No differences in the plasma content of the investigated compounds were found between a group of Carollia perspicillata kept in captivity for 20 years and free-ranging individuals from a population in Central America. No sex related differences were obvious. In conclusion, nutritional biomarkers in bats were highly variable due to dietary and possible species-specific differences.",

We postulated that bats from desert environments have lower metabolic rates (MR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) than their mesic counterparts. To test this idea, we measured MR and TEWL of four species of bats, which inhabit the Negev desert in Israel, one species mainly restricted to hyper-arid deserts (Otonycteris hemprichii), two species from semi-desert areas (Eptesicus bottae and Plecotus christii), and one widespread species (Pipistrellus kuhlii). We also measured separately, in the same individuals, the two components of TEWL, respiratory water loss (RWL) and cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL), using a mask. In all the species, MR and TEWL were signiﬁcantly reduced during torpor, the latter being a consequence of reductions in both RWL and CEWL. Then, we evaluated whether MR and TEWL in bats differ according to their geographic distributions, and whether those rates change with Ta and the use of torpor. We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in MR among species, but we found that TEWL was lowest in the species restricted to desert habitats, intermediate in the semi-desert dwelling species, and highest in the widespread species, perhaps a consequence of adaptation to life in deserts. Our results were supported by a subsequent analysis of data collected from the literature on rates of TEWL for 35 bat species from desert and mesic habitats.",

Bats have long lifespans and low reproductive rates which make them vulnerable to environmental changes. Global warming causes Bechstein’s bats (\n              Myotis bechsteinii\n              ) to produce larger females that face a higher mortality risk. Here, we test whether these larger females are able to offset their elevated mortality risk by adopting a faster life history. We analysed an individual-based 25-year dataset from 331 RFID-tagged wild bats and combine genetic pedigrees with data on survival, reproduction and body size. We find that size-dependent fecundity and age at first reproduction drive the observed increase in mortality. Because larger females have an earlier onset of reproduction and shorter generation times, lifetime reproductive success remains remarkably stable across individuals with different body sizes. Our study demonstrates a rapid shift to a faster pace of life in a mammal with a slow life history.",

Vespertilionidae has a world-wide distribution. Mystacinidae is restricted to New Zealand, although related to ﬁve neotropical families and one in Madagascar reﬂecting a shared Gondwanan origin of their Noctilionoidea superfamily. Both species have highly variable body temperatures and rates of metabolism. They feed on ﬂying insects, which requires them to be torpid in shelters during cold, wet periods. In dry weather Mystacina is active in winter at ambient temperatures as low as −1.0 °C, foraging for terrestrial invertebrates in leaf litter, even in the presence of snow, and consuming fruit, nectar, and pollen from endemic plants that bloom in winter. The behavior of Mystacina expands its presence in a cool, wet, temperate forest in a manner unlike any other bat, another example of the distinctive characteristics of the endemic New Zealand fauna. The use of torpor generally depends on a series of factors, including body mass, ambient temperature, latitude, reproductive cycle, sociality, and fat deposits. These factors result in a diversity of responses that range along a continuum from short-term torpor to hibernation.",

A correlation between characters may be direct or derived from shared correlations with intervening factors without a direct interaction. Basal rate of metabolism in these bats increases with brain mass: large brains are more expensive than small brains, and both brain mass and basal rate increase with body mass. Basal rate and brain mass also correlate with food habits in bats. Mass-independent basal rate weakly correlates with mass-independent brain mass, the correlation only accounting for 12% of the variation in basal rate, which disappears when the combined eﬀects of body mass and food habits are deleted. The correlation between basal rate and brain mass seen in this and other studies usually accounts for < 10% of the variation in basal rate and often < 4%, even when statistically signiﬁcant, a minimalist explanation for the level the basal rate. This correlation probably reﬂects the intermediacy of secondary factors, as occurred with food habits in bats. Most biological correlations are complicated and must be examined in detail before assurance can be given as to their bases.",

The scope of this research sought to analyze the rabies surveillance and control actions carried out in municipalities in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Questionnaires were distributed to a representative sample of zoonosis control service managers proportionately calculated in accordance with the Health Regions, according to the State Regionalization Guidance Plan. The data gathered was recorded and analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques. Based on the results attained, the conclusion reached is that the rabies surveillance and control actions were being unsatisfactorily conducted, especially for items related to the monitoring of vampire bat colonies, viral circulation surveillance, notification and monitoring of suspect or aggressive animals, quantification of dog population and population control of stray dogs. The surveillance and control of rabies was being neglected, and was not a priority in the health services in the municipalities evaluated.",

The X chromosome and pair 15 autosome probes are from Phyllostomus hastatus and the Y from Carollia brevicauda. On both species with the neo-XX/XY system, the autosome translocated to the sex chromosomes is the pair 15 in P. hastatus, a synapomorphy.",
