Ten adult bats from each species captured and investigated using histological, histochemical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our ﬁnding showed that tongue of both species carried mechanical and gustatory papillae. In Ra, the mechanical papillae were subdivided to conical (small and large) and ﬁliform (giant, rousette, leaf-like and spear-like) papillae with regional-speciﬁc lingual arrangement. However, there were only two types of ﬁliform papillae in Tp (pronged and crown-shaped). Consistently, though both species carried three vallate papillae at the radix linguae, our histological ﬁndings showed comparably varied structure for these papillae. The vallate papillae contained about ten ovoid taste buds in Tp, while it was made up of single barrel-shaped taste bud in Ra. Based on their dietary diversity, the gastro-intestinal tract in both species showed remarkable differences. Importantly, our records revealed that Tp had thicker stomach layers with increased mucosal folding arborization (rugae) than Ra. In addition to signiﬁcantly increased numbers of branched gastric glands in Tp compared to Ra. Intestinal villi were relatively shorter in Tp with increased numbers of goblet cells than Ra; with different topography in SEM. The gastric mucous cells and intestinal goblet cells were positive for alcian blue stain, while the neutral mucopolysaccharides were detected in the mucosal basal parietal and chief cells and intestinal crypts of Lieberkühn with intense reactions in Tp more than Ra. These ﬁndings brought out distinct paradox adaptations in tongues and digestive tracts; based on the dietary and energetic demand for each species.",

Based on the description of Noctilio and the comparisons with other Neotropical bat species, we conclude that this genus has a set of morphological characteristics (e.g. the shape of the radiusscaphocentralunate facet, the presence of two scaphocentralunatemagnum facets, the palmar notch of the trapezoid and the palmarly expanded greater tubercle in metacarpal V) that clearly distinguish it from the families Phyllostomidae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae. The distinguished morphological characters of Noctilio may be closely related to its evolutionary history, but also to ecological aspects such as the slow and maneuverable flight and pisciv­ orous and arthropodophagous habits. However, in the proximal carpal joint of Noctilio some characters are shared with phyllostomids and some vespertilionids while it differs with molossids and Lasiurini. Finally, the anatomical and functional information provided will be very useful for future comparative studies involving extant and extinct species, in order to analyze the anatomical changes archived for to powered flight.",

Furthermore, it aims to identify the enteroendocrine cells that produce serotonin (5-HT), somatostatin (SST), and cholecystokinin (CCK) in the intestine and CCK, SST, glucagon (CGC) and insulin (INS) in the pancreas, relating histological characteristics with feeding habits, besides contributing to basic research on as­ pects of the diffuse neuroendocrine system of mammals. Histologically, the intestinal wall of the species D. capixaba and P. bilabiatum was similar to that of other mammals. The height of the villi in the small intestine was different among the species studied. In the duodenum and ileum, PAS positive secretion was observed. The duodenal gland present only in P. bilabiatum showed intense reaction for PAS stain, indicating neutral glycos­ aminoglycans (GAGs). The frequency and distribution of 5-HT Immunoreactive (IR) cells varied among the species. In D. capixaba, these cells were evident only in the ileum (11.8 ± 2.9 μm) and large intestine region. In P. bilabiatum were different among the segments, with the highest frequency in the duodenum (13.3 ± 2.8 μm), jejunum (8.1 ± 2.3 μm) and ileum (10.1 ± 1.9 μm). CCK-IR cells were not observed in D. capixaba. In P. bilabiatum these cells were observed in the ileum (9.5 ± 1.3 μm). SST-IR cells were not found throughout the intestine of the studied species. The pancreas of bats presents islets with differentiated cellular composition. All the antibodies used (CCK, SST, GCG and INS) obtained positive staining in the pancreatic islets of both the species studied. The INS-IR cells marked the entire islet in both species, whereas the CGC-IR cells were visualized throughout the islet in D. capixaba and preferentially in the periphery in P. bilabiatum. CCK and SST-IR cells were located in the peripheral region of the islets in both species. In our study we observed similarities in the intestinal and pancreatic morphology of the studied species, although there were interspecific differences in the distri­ bution of intestinal GAGs and enteroendocrine cells. This suggests that these differences may be more related to the distinct feeding habits of each species than to their phylogeny, as they belong to the same family.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats exhibit remarkable diversity in dietary habits, with species specializing on insects, fruit, nectar, vertebrates and blood. Studies of larger mammals have shown that structural differences in dentary cross-sectional properties exist among species with different diets. Unfortunately, few of these studies have considered the role of phylogeny in shaping these apparent form–function associations. Here we ask whether a relationship exists between diet and dentary structure in bats when phylogenetic history is factored into the analysis. To answer this question, we compared results from phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) and traditional (nonphylogenetic) regression analyses of dentary cross-sectional shape in frugivorous, nectarivorous, and insectivorous bats (253 individuals representing 72 species). Cross-sectional moments of inertia of the dentary between M1 and M2 were computed from bone densitometry scans of skeletal specimens. Traditional regressions of cross-sectional parameters against dentary length detected signiﬁcant departures from isometry among frugivores. In contrast, PGLS analyses indicated that cross-sectional variables for each dietary group scaled with isometry. Thus, the allometric patterns illuminated by traditional statistics are linked to the phylogenetic structure of the sample. Identical patterns of signiﬁcant differences in slopes and intercepts between frugivores and nectarivores emerged from both traditional and PGLS analyses. As predicted, the cross-sectional shape of the dentary in frugivores is consistent with increased resistance to torsion and bending, while that of nectarivores suggested a less resistant dentary. Although traditional and PGLS analyses yielded some similar results, the phylogenetic structure of a sample can drive apparent patterns of scaling and should be considered in comparative functional analyses.",

Pups were reluctant to move until 25 days of age and started ﬂuttering at the mean age of 40 days. The wingspan and wing area increased linearly until 45 days of age by which time the young bats exhibited clumsy ﬂight with gentle turns. At birth, C. sphinx had less-developed handwings compared to armwings; however, the handwing developed faster than the armwing during the postnatal period. Young bats achieved sustained ﬂight at 55 days of age. Wing loading decreased linearly until 35 days of age and thereafter increased to a maximum of 12.82 N mÀ2 at 125 days of age. The logistic equation ﬁtted the postnatal changes in wingspan and wing area better than the Gompertz and von Bertalanffy equations. The predicted minimum power speed (Vmp) and maximum range speed (Vmr) decreased until the onset of ﬂight and thereafter the Vmp and Vmr increased linearly and approached 96.2% and 96.4%, respectively, of the speed of postpartum females at the age of 125 days. The requirement of minimum ﬂight power (Pmp) and maximum range power (Pmr) increased until 85 days of age and thereafter stabilised. The minimum theoretical radius of banked turn (rmin) decreased until 35 days of age and thereafter increased linearly and attained 86.5% of the rmin of postpartum females at the age of 125 days.",

Comparative anatomical analyses of diﬀerent species of bats can contribute to a better understanding of morphological diversity of this organ, concerning organization and function. In this study, we describe the external morphology and histomorphology of the penis and baculum in eleven species of molossid bats. The present study showed that penile organization in these species displayed the basic vascular mammalian pattern and had a similar pattern concerning the presence of the tissues constituting the penis, exhibiting three types of erectile tissue (the corpus cavernosum, accessory cavernous tissue, and corpus spongiosum) around the urethra. However, certain features varied among the species, demonstrating that most species are distinguishable by glans and baculum morphology and glans histological organization. Major variations in glans morphology were genus-speciﬁc, and the greatest similarities were shared by Eumops species and N. laticaudatus. The greatest interspeciﬁc similarities occurred between M. molossus and M. rufus and between Eumops species. Save for M. molossus and M. rufus, morphology of the baculum was species-speciﬁc; and in E. perotis, it did not occur in all specimens, indicating that it is probably under selection. In the histological organization, the most evident diﬀerences were number of septa and localization of the corpora cavernosa. In species with a baculum (Molossus, Eumops and Nyctinomops species), the corpora cavernosa predominantly occupied the dorsal region of the penile glans and is associated with the proximal (basal) portion of the baculum. In species that do not have a baculum (Cynomops, Molossops and Neoplatymops species), the corpora cavernosa predominantly occupied the ventro-lateral region of the glans.",

            "abstractNote": "Nearly 75% of all emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) that impact or threaten human health are zoonotic. The majority have spilled from wildlife reservoirs, either directly to humans or via domestic animals. The emergence of many can be attributed to predisposing factors such as global travel, trade, agricultural expansion, deforestation/habitat fragmentation, and urbanization; such factors increase the interface and/or the rate of contact between human, domestic animal, and wildlife populations, thereby creating increased opportunities for spillover events to occur. Infectious disease emergence can be regarded as primarily an ecological process. The epidemiological investigation of EIDs associated with wildlife requires a trans-disciplinary approach that includes an understanding of the ecology of the wildlife species, and an understanding of human behaviours that increase risk of exposure. Investigations of the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 provide useful case studies. The emergence of Nipah virus was associated with the increased size and density of commercial pig farms and their encroachment into forested areas. The movement of pigs for sale and slaughter in turn led to the rapid spread of infection to southern peninsular Malaysia, where the high-density, largely urban pig populations facilitated transmission to humans. Identifying the factors associated with the emergence of SARS in southern China requires an understanding of the ecology of infection both in the natural reservoir and in secondary market reservoir species. A necessary extension of understanding the ecology of the reservoir is an understanding of the trade, and of the social and cultural context of wildlife consumption. Emerging infectious diseases originating from wildlife populations will continue to threaten public health. Mitigating and managing the risk requires an appreciation of the connectedness between human, livestock and wildlife health, and of the factors and processes that disrupt the balance.",

Studies using biomechanical indices to explore the relationships between forelimb skeletal morphology and ecological aspects are scarce in bats. For this reason, we decided to analyze, in a functional context, the relationship between forelimb morphology and feeding ecology of Neotropical bats. To describe the morphology of the forelimbs, we used six biomechanical indices, and evaluated their correlation with foraging habitats and trophic guilds in five families of bats distributed in the Neotropical region. We examined 140 specimens belonging to 23 genera and 43 extant species. Among the morpho-functional indices analyzed, the epicondylar index, the humeral robustness, and the radial distal end width index were the variables that most contributed to the discriminant functions. Our results showed a direct correlation between forelimb morphology and foraging habitats, which could indicate that these morphological characteristics are possibly shared, despite the different evolutionary histories in the analyzed taxa. Here, we provide new morpho-functional and biomechanical data that will facilitate the evaluation of the evolution of morphological diversification in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically initiated after an animal pathogen has caused disease in humans. Early detection of potentially high-risk pathogens within animal hosts may facilitate medical interventions to cope with an emerging disease. To effectively spillover to a novel host, a pathogen may undergo genetic changes resulting in varying transmission potential in the new host and potentially to humans. Rabies virus (RABV) is one model pathogen to consider for studying the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases under both laboratory and ﬁeld conditions. The evolutionary history of RABV is characterized by regularly documented spillover infections and a series of notable host shifts. Within this context, enhanced ﬁeld surveillance to improve detection of spillover infections will require validated techniques to non-invasively differentiate infected from non-infected individuals. In this study, we evaluate the use of infrared thermography to detect thermal changes associated with experimental RABV infection in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in a captive colony. Our results indicated that 62% of rabid bats had detectable facial temperature decreases ()4.6°C, SD ± 2.5) compared with pre-inoculation baseline values. These data suggest potential utility for discriminating rabid bats in natural ﬁeld settings. In addition, focusing upon RABV circulating in the United States between 2008 and 2011, we conﬁrmed spillover events of bat RABV among carnivores and identiﬁed cross-species transmission events caused by four lineages of RABV associated with insectivorous bats. Additionally, our analysis of RABV glycoprotein sequences identiﬁed substitutions in antigenic sites that may affect neutralizing activity associated with monoclonal antibodies proposed for use in human post-exposure prophylaxis. This study provides a glimpse into RABV pathobiology and spillover dynamics among and between bats and a variety of mesocarnivores.",

            "abstractNote": "In Brazil, rabies control in dogs and cats was pioneered by the state of S~ao Paulo with the adoption of the Pan American Health Organization recommendations for prophylaxis and control, which led to a reduction in rabies cases from 1994 onwards. As a result of these measures, the rabies virus (RABV) genetic lineage associated with dogs has not been found in the state since 1998, and all the cases in domestic animals reported since then have been caused by bat-associated lineages of RABV. In the light of this, this study sought to investigate rabies cases in dogs and cats in the state of S~ao Paulo between 2005 and 2014 and identify the associated transmission cycles by characterizing the RABV lineages responsible for these cases. Nine samples from dogs (n = 5) and from cats (n = 4) were collected between 2005 and 2014. The tenth animal, a rabid cat, was analysed by a different laboratory. The N gene nucleotide sequences obtained were analysed with the neighbor-joining algorithm and Kimura 2parameter model using the MEGA 6 program. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the genetic lineages identiﬁed in all the samples were those circulating in Brazilian bats. The ﬁndings of this study demonstrate that bats play an important role in the transmission of rabies to domestic animals in S~ao Paulo state and that emphasis should be placed on the implementation of public policies to support surveillance of chiropterans for rabies.",

            "abstractNote": "In recent years, bats have been found to harbour many viruses, raising several questions about their role as reservoirs and potential disseminators of zoonotic viruses. We investigated the presence of six virus families in bats in three regions of CentralSouthern Italy. Astroviruses were identified in seven of 13 bat species. Sequence analysis revealed marked genetic heterogeneity among the astroviruses identified, with nucleotide identity ranging between 60.26% and 87.62%. Astrovirus diversity was not associated with the bat species, the geographic areas or the bat colony, suggesting the circulation of several astrovirus strains in Italian ecosystems. Genetic diversification and interspecies transmission appear common in bat astroviruses and could provide, potentially, the bases for transmission to humans and other mammals. Yet overemphasizing this risk might have detrimental consequences for bat conservation and preservation of the important ecosystem services bats provide.",

            "abstractNote": "Historically, Australia was considered free of rabies and rabieslike viruses. Thus, the identification of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) in 1996 in a debilitated bat found by a member of the public precipitated both public health consternation and a revision of lyssavirus taxonomy. Subsequent observational studies sought to elaborate the occurrence and frequency of ABLV infection in Australian bats. This paper describes the taxonomic diversity of bat species showing evidence of ABLV infection to better inform public health considerations. Blood and/or brain samples were collected from two cohorts of bats (wild‐caught and diagnostic submissions) from four Australian states or territories between April 1996 and October 2002. Fresh brain impression smears were tested for ABLV antigen using fluorescein‐labelled anti‐rabies monoclonal globulin (CENTOCOR) in a direct fluorescent antibody test; sera were tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies using a rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. A total of 3,217 samples from 2,633 bats were collected and screened: brain samples from 1,461 wild‐caught bats and 1,086 submitted bats from at least 16 genera and seven families, and blood samples from 656 wild‐caught bats and 14 submitted bats from 14 genera and seven families. Evidence of ABLV infection was found in five of the six families of bats occurring in Australia, and in three of the four Australian states/territories surveyed, supporting the historic presence of the virus in Australia. While the infection prevalence in the wild‐caught cohort is evidently low, the significantly higher infection prevalence in rescued bats in urban settings represents a clear and present public health significance because of the higher risk of human exposure.",

There has been no comprehensive documentation of the native mammal fauna of Togo since 1893. Our review of the extant and extirpated mammals of Togo includes 178 species, with Chiroptera (52 species) and Rodentia (47 species) being the most speciose groups. This number does not include additional species recorded along the borders of Togo, and whose presence inside the country is not verified. Seven species of mammals are presumably extinct in the country, but we confirmed that two species of large ungulates, reputed to be extinct, survive in remote forest habitats. Ecological Zone IV, sustaining the moist forest areas, and Ecological Zone I, inclusive of all the relatively undisturbed dry savannahs of the extreme North of the country, are the most important regions for mammal diversity and conservation.",

Serum samples (n = 364) were collected from participants from the villages and tested for coronavirus antibodies using a human coronavirus IgG ELISA kit. Our results showed that 10.44% (38/364; 21 males and 17 females) of the villagers had antibodies against human coronaviruses. The odds ratio for coronavirus positivity in the villagers in the central region who were exposed to bats was 4.75, 95% CI 1.04–­21.70, when compared to that in the non-­exposed villagers. The sociodemographics, knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of the villagers were also recorded and analysed by using a quantitative structured questionnaire. Our results showed that 62.36% (227/364) of the villagers had been exposed to bats at least once in the past six months. Low monthly family income was statistically significant in increasing the risk for coronavirus seropositivity among the villagers (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.13–­7.49). In-­depth interviews among the coronavirus-­positive participants (n = 30) showed that cultural context, local norms and beliefs could influence to bat exposure activities. In conclusion, our results provide baseline information on human coronavirus antibodies and KAP regarding to bat exposure among villagers in Thailand.",

We recorded 34 small mammal species: three species of shrews (Soricidae Fischer, 1815), 12 species of rodents, one primate (Galagidae Gray, 1825) and 17 species of bats (Chiroptera Blumenbach, 1779). The rodent Stochomys longicaudatus (Tullberg, 1893) appears to be a first record for Ghana. Two shrew, three rodent and one bat species were first records for the Volta Region. By comparing our small mammal captures and limited microhabitat data from 1999 and 2001 to forest cover change maps for the period 2000-2015 we discuss trends in species community changes due to forest cover loss and other disturbance regimes. Aside from contributing to our understanding of the distribution of several small mammal species, the study demonstrates the progressive loss of forest habitat in the Volta Region.",

            "abstractNote": "In zoological nomenclature, to be potentially valid, nomenclatural novelties (i.e., new nomina and nomenclatural acts) need first to be made available, that is, published in works qualifying as publications as defined by the International Code of zoological Nomenclature (“the Code”). In September 2012, the Code was amended in order to allow the recognition of works electronically published online after 2011 as publications available for the purpose of zoological nomenclature, provided they meet several conditions, notably a preregistration of the work in ZooBank. Despite these new Rules, several of the long-discussed problems concerning the electronic publication of new nomina and nomenclatural acts have not been resolved. The publication of this amendment provides an opportunity to discuss some of these in detail. It is important to note that: (1) all works published only online before 2012 are nomenclaturally unavailable; (2) printed copies of the PDFs of works which do not have their own ISSN or ISBN, and which are not obtainable free of charge or by purchase, do not qualify as publications but must be seen as facsimiles of unavailable works and are unable to provide nomenclatural availability to any nomenclatural novelties they may contain; (3) prepublications online of later released online publications are unavailable, i.e., they do not advance the date of publication; (4) the publication dates of works for which online prepublications had been released are not those of these prepublications and it is critical that the real release date of such works appear on the actual final electronic publication, but this is not currently the case in electronic periodicals that distribute such online prepublications and which still indicate on their websites and PDFs the date of release of prepublication as that of publication of the work; (5) supplementary online materials and subsequent formal corrections of either paper or electronic publications distributed only online are nomenclaturally unavailable; (6) nomenclatural information provided on online websites that do not have a fixed content and format, with ISSN or ISBN, is unavailable. We give precise examples of many of these nomenclatural problems. Several of them, when they arise, are due to the fact that the availability of nomenclatural novelties now depends on information that will have to be sought not from the work itself but from extrinsic evidence. As shown by several examples discussed here, an electronic document can be modified while keeping the same DOI and publication date, which is not compatible with the requirements of zoological nomenclature. Therefore, another system of registration of electronic documents as permanent and inalterable will have to be devised. ZooBank also clearly needs to be improved in several respects. Mention in a work of its registration number (LSID) in ZooBank would seem to be possible only if this registration has occurred previously, but some works that have purportedly been registered in ZooBank are in fact missing on this web application. In conclusion, we offer recommendations to authors, referees, editors, publishers, libraries and the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, in the hope that such problems can be limited along with the potential chaos in zoological nomenclature that could result, if careful attention is not paid to the problems we highlight here, from a somewhat misplaced, and perhaps now widespread, understanding that electronic publication of nomenclatural novelties is now allowed and straightforward. We suggest that, as long as the problematic points linked to the new amendment and to electronic publication as a whole are not resolved, nomenclatural novelties continue to be published in paper-printed journals that have so far shown editorial competence regarding taxonomy and nomenclature, which is not the case of several recent electronic-only published journals.",

Upon receiving the specimens, the curator of the Berlin Zoological Museum, Martin Lichtenstein, removed the original labels and replaced with ones containing more generalized locations. As a consequence, several type specimens have now dubious type localities. We examined these types as well as geographically restricted mammals collected by Sellow. In some cases, there are inconsistencies between the specimen label and the collection catalog regarding the collecting locality. We conclude that the locality information on the lectotype of the tent-making bat Uroderma bilobatum is mistakenly identified, and therefore, we restrict it to “eastern Brazil”. We designate a lectoype for Azara’s agouti, Dasyprocta azarae, and restrict its type locality to the region travelled by Sellow in São Paulo. Although there are no recent records of the woolly giant rat, Kunsia tomentosus, from its type locality, the species may have been recently extirpated from the area. Two primate specimens supposedly collected by Sellow, a silvery marmoset, Mico argentatus, and a black tamarin, Saguinus niger, occur only in the Amazonia of northern Brazil, outside the route travelled by the naturalist, and are more likely to have been collected by Sieber. Our investigations stress the importance of collecting vouchers for verifying species occurrence records and establishing a solid taxonomy.",
