            "abstractNote": "The vast majority of trypanosome species is vector-borne parasites, with some of them being medically and veterinary important (such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei) and capable of causing serious illness in vertebrate hosts. The discovery of trypanosomes in bats emphasizes the importance of bats as an important reservoir. Interestingly, there is a hypothesis that bats are ancestral hosts of T. cruzi. Trypanosome diversity has never been investigated in bats in Thailand, despite being in a biodiversity hot spot. To gain a better understanding of the diversity and evolutionary relationship of trypanosomes, polymerase chain reaction-based surveys were carried out from 2018 to 2020 in 17 sites. A total of 576 bats were captured, representing 23 species. A total of 38 (6.6%) positive samples was detected in ten bat species. Trypanosoma dionisii and Trypanosoma noyesi were identified from Myotis siligorensis and Megaderma spasma, respectively. The remaining 18S rRNA sequences of trypanosomes were related to other trypanosomes previously reported elsewhere. The sequences in the current study showed nucleotide identity as low as 90.74% compared to those of trypanosomes in the GenBank database, indicating the possibility of new species. All bat trypanosomes identified in the current study fall within the T. cruzi clade. The current study adds to evidence linking T. noyesi to a bat trypanosome and further supports the bat host origin of the T. cruzi clade. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first study on bat trypanosomes in Thailand and their phylogenetic relationships with global isolates.",

            "abstractNote": "Amphibians are experiencing a panzootic of unprecedented proportions caused by the emergence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, all species are not equally at risk of infection, and risk is further modified by environmental variables, specifically temperature. In order to understand how, and when, hosts mount a response to Bd we analysed infection dynamics and patterns of gene expression in the model amphibian species Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis. Mathematical modelling of infection dynamics demonstrate the existence of a temperature-dependent protective response that is largely independent of the intrinsic growth-rate of Bd. Using temporal expression-profiling by microarrays and qRT-PCR, we characterise this response in the main amphibian lymphoid tissue, the spleen. We demonstrate that clearance of Bd at the host-optimal temperature is not clearly associated with an adaptive immune response, but rather is correlated with the induction of components of host innate immunity including the expression of genes that are associated with the production of the antimicrobial skin peptide preprocareulein (PPCP) as well as inflammatory responses. We find that adaptive immunity appears to be lacking at host-optimal temperatures. This suggests that either Bd does not stimulate, or suppresses, adaptive immunity, or that trade-offs exist between innate and adaptive limbs of the amphibian immune system. At cold temperatures, S. tropicalis loses the ability to mount a PPCP-based innate response, and instead manifests a more pronounced inflammatory reaction that is characterised by the production of proteases and higher pathogen burdens. This study demonstrates the temperature-dependency of the amphibian response to infection by Bd and indicates the influence that changing climates may exert on the ectothermic host response to pathogens.",

            "abstractNote": "We presented a comparative study of two species of South American bats, Myotis albescens and Eumops patagonicus, about prenatal development. This study was carried out using 60 specimens, which were measured and photographed, and the embryonic stage was assigned by the staging system for Carollia perspicillata. We observed that the chorionic vesicle showed similarities in the disposition of the extraembryonic membranes, but they differed in characteristics of their yolk sac; in E. patagonicus, it was more glandular than M. albescens. M. albescens presented a well-developed discoid placenta with a caudal antimesometrial position, but E. patagonicus presented a diffuse placenta, which persists until the end of gestation and a discoid placenta in the uterus–tubal junction. In the embryogenesis, early stages, middle stages, and late stages were deﬁned. In the early stage, the embryonic morphology is similar in the two species. The middle stage is characterized by the muzzle and pinna formation, fore and hind limb regionalization, and the formation of the patagium primordium. In the late stage, the overall growth of the embryo occurs. Its fore and hind limbs, patagium, and the typical craniofacial features are conﬁgured. We conclude that in early stages of development, the embryonic morphology of M. albescens and E. patagonicus is similar, while in late stages differences are evident; mainly the craniofacial structures and uropatagium conﬁguration characteristics that allow their classiﬁcation at the family level. Moreover, differences in time of fusion of maxillary and mandibular process were registered. This could be related to the morphology of the muzzle of each species.

We measured BMR and plasma levels of thyroid hormone (T3) and leptin in bats captured in maternity colonies in eastern Massachusetts (MA; northern population) and in Alabama and Georgia (ALGA; southern population) to assess macrogeographic (between- or among-population) and microgeographic (within-population) variation in those traits. After accounting for effects of body mass, stage of pregnancy, and within-population variation, bats from the northern population did not differ signiﬁcantly in BMR, T3, or leptin values from those in the southern population. However, after accounting for the effects of body mass and stage of pregnancy, a test for differences in all traits among colonies from both populations was signiﬁcant. For BMR, bats differed signiﬁcantly among the northern colonies. Moreover, after removing the effects of body mass and stage of pregnancy, bats from the AL colony had signiﬁcantly higher BMR than did bats from all other colonies except one in MA, and they had signiﬁcantly higher T3 levels but lower leptin levels than did bats from two other colonies. The presence of among-colony and withinpopulation variation for these traits suggests that proximate (nonevolutionary) factors (e.g., microhabitat differences such as roost type) play an important role in shaping intraspeciﬁc variation in BMR and its hormone correlates.",

As a result, artiﬁcial roosts are increasingly proposed as a short to medium-term mitigation measure, despite the absence of speciﬁc protocols for the installation, maintenance, and suitability for New Zealand bats. As of 2021, more than 110 artiﬁcial roosts had been installed in urban parks within Hamilton City, New Zealand. To determine their uptake and suitability for long-tailed bats, 74 Kent style roosts of varying ages were monitored for 1 year, with 24 (32%) roosts observed occupied by long-tailed bats. Occupation was generally infrequent, with no clear seasonal pattern or speciﬁc areas of occupation. However, two older roosts were consistently occupied, with numbers notably increasing during the summer maternity season. Distance to stand edge was the only factor that could be used to predict occupation, with logistic regression indicating that long-tailed bats may prefer roosts in less exposed areas with stable microclimates, within tree stands or sheltered landscape features. Future artiﬁcial roost installations should site roosts away from the stand edge in sheltered locations, ideally near natural or already occupied roosts to facilitate discovery and uptake.",

We used radiotelemetry to track 9 adult females, including 3 lactating and 6 postlactating bats, during July–September 2003. We found that these bats showed considerable fidelity to a common foraging area at the confluence of the John Day River and a tributary creek along which bats commuted and roosted. Individual bats did not roost together, but each showed high fidelity to local clusters of rock outcrops in small side canyons along the tributary. Roosts were not found in large, exposed cliff faces, despite the availability of such features. Rather, radio-tagged bats roosted in smaller outcrops that averaged 4.5 m in height. Bats commuted up to 12 km from roosts in the tributary canyon to the common foraging site at the river confluence and remained on the wing to forage for up to 4 h before returning to day roosts. No radio-tagged bats were observed using night roosts, even after pups were weaned. Our study provides a description of roosting, commuting, and foraging activity, as well as habitat use, of western small-footed myotis. This information provides a nuanced perspective on the ecology of canyon-dwelling bats in the region. Such perspective could be useful for conservation and habitat management.",

The skull measurements of 11 out of the 12 species were osteometrically examined using principal component analyses (PCA) based on 33 craniodental measurements from 150 specimens. Our analyses indicated that according to the overall skull size, the studied species could be divided as follows: large species (M. tiensa and M. fionae), medium-sized species (M. huttoni, M. cyclotis, M. annamitica, M. beelzebub, M. walstoni, and M. feae), and small species (M. eleryi, M. chrysochaetes, and M. harpioloides). The three size clusters did not overlap with each other in terms of total length of the skull (STOTL), mandible length (ML) and log-transformed raw data PC1 scores. Within a cluster, several species pairs overlapped in overall skull size despite of differences in the shapes. The PCA results suggested that Murina species of Vietnam were differentiated with a combination of the skull size and shape. Sexual dimorphism was confirmed in M. cyclotis and M. annamitica, with the females larger than the males. Particularly, M. cyclotis showed extensive sexual dimorphism with no overlaps in the measurements, whereas M. annamitica showed less measurable differences between the sexes. It was also evidenced that the extent of sexbiased size dimorphism differs among species in the genus Murina.",

We found that although R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx were the two primary seed dispersers of S. oblatum over half of the fruit produced by the tree (65%) fell to the ground. Out of the fruit collected, R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx were able to disperse seeds up to 73 m from the parent tree with the highest density of feeding roosts occurring at 21.3 m (SE = 5.2 m). We found no signs that either species of bat used the parent tree as a feeding roost, instead choosing speciﬁc trees that were at lower densities compared with other trees in the forest that were not used. When comparing the viability of seeds in three different habitats (under parent tree, in forest gap, under feeding roost) survival analysis revealed that seedling survival was signiﬁcantly higher in the forest gap (91.7% ± 4.41%) than under the parent tree (78.3% ± 1.67%), but was not signiﬁcantly different to seedling survival underneath feeding roosts (86.7 ± 1.67%). Further work also showed that the seeds did not have to be removed from the fruit or ingested by the bat in order to germinate. We conclude that although S. oblatum is not dependent on R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx for successful germination of its seeds, these two species of bat are important seed dispersers and can move seeds to areas where there is a greater chance of germination success and survival.",

Therefore, our aim was to investigate physiological and behavioural strategies employed by the fruit bat Nyctimene robinsoni (body mass ~50g) in winter in tropical Northern Queensland in relation to ambient temperature (Ta) and the lunar cycle. Daily body temperature (Tb) fluctuations in free-ranging bats were measured via radio-telemetry and metabolic rate was measured in captivity via open-flow respirometry (Ta, 15–30°C). Free-ranging bats showed a significant 24h circadian cycle in Tb, with the lowest Tb at the end of the rest phase just after sunset and the highest Tb at the end of the activity phase just before sunrise. Average daily core Tb ranged from 34.7±0.6 to 37.3±0.8°C (mean ± s.d.) over an average daily Ta range of 17.1±1.1 to 23.5±1.8°C. Tb never fell below 30°C but Tb was significantly reduced during the full moon period compared with that during the new moon period. Tb was correlated with Ta during the second half of the rest phase (P<0.001) but not during the active phase. Resting metabolic rate of bats was significantly affected by Ta (P<0.001, R20.856). Our results show that tube-nosed bats exhibit reduced Tb on moonlit nights when they reduce foraging activity, but during our study torpor was not expressed. The energy constraints experienced here by tube-nosed bats with relatively moderate Ta fluctuations, short commuting distances between roosting and feeding locations, and high availability of food were probably not substantial enough to require use of torpor.",

The lesser longnosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) is classiﬁed as threatened in Mexico; however, many aspects of its reproductive biology are still unstudied. The formation of a dorsal patch in males of Leptonycteris spp. during the mating period has been described and evidence suggests this patch is involved in reproductive behavior. We determined the male reproductive cycle of L. yerbabuenae over time based on the seminiferous cycle. We then related these internal indicators with 3 external indicators—testis size, dorsal patch size, and female/male ratio in the population. Finally, we evaluated whether the epididymis functions in long-term sperm storage. Bats were captured monthly and external indicators were registered. Three adult males were euthanized each month for the evaluation of internal indicators. We determined only 1 period of spermatogenesis per year beginning in September and completing in January. The seminiferous epithelium cycle showed 11 stages and 14 steps. Internal reproductive indicators were correlated with external indicators. External testis size and female/male ratio were positively correlated with dorsal patch size. A testis size of approximately 48.2 mm2 corresponded with the beginning of sperm production. The epididymis was not involved in long-term sperm storage. This study provides the 1st description in L. yerbabuenae of the annual timing of the male reproductive cycle based on histological characteristics, and also reports a relationship between the size of the dorsal patch and male reproductive function.",

            "abstractNote": "Generalized pollination systems may be advantageous on island systems or regions of substantial disturbance. We examined whether or not specialization breakdown has occurred in a presumably bat-pollinated columnar cactus, Pilosocereus royenii, on Puerto Rico, an island subjected to periodic hurricanes. The ﬂowers show characteristics related to bat pollination including nocturnal anthesis, morphology, and amount and quality of nectar reward. The cactus produces ﬂowers whose styles are temporally and mechanically separated from its anthers and do not self-pollinate. Hand manipulations indicated that it is partially self-incompatible or suffers some inbreeding depression. In 217 h of observations conducted biweekly over the course of 1 yr, P. royenii received visits from bats, moths, bees, and birds, but the only effective pollinator was the carpenter bee, Xylocopa mordax. Only four bat visits were recorded, all prior to stigma receptiveness. Floral morphology of P. royenii was signiﬁcantly more variable than that of other bat-pollinated species of the genus. We propose that infrequent bat visits are a consequence of a population crash and that ﬂoral variability is due to either relaxed selection for bat pollination or a transitional stage from bat pollination to bee pollination.",

Using mist nets and ultrasonic recordings we release new information on activity patterns and roost use by M. atacamensis in Chile. We also report new records for the species, extending its distribution range to Santiago Metropolitan region. Our results suggest a wide distribution and relative abundance of M. atacamensis in northern Chile, in addition to remarkable habitat diversity for populations of this species. Bats were active in both natural and anthropogenic habitats. Abandoned mines and buildings in rural villages were the roosts most used by the species. These data provide additional information on the distribution, ecology, and natural history of M. atacamensis and can be useful in the design of conservation action plans for populations in the country.",

Phenology, pollination biology and behaviour of ﬂower visitors of this species were compared in six conserved and disturbed sites, hypothesising that: (i) pitire pollination is self-incompatible, requiring animal vectors; (ii) higher incidence of radiation on plants in cleared forest may lead to a higher number of ﬂowers per pitire plant and longer blooming season, and disturbing and differential spatial availability of ﬂower resources may determine differential attraction of pollinators to conserved and disturbed areas; (iii) if pitire pollination system is specialised, reproductive success would decrease with pollinator scarcity, or other species may substitute for main pollinators. In all sites, pitire reproduction started in January, ﬂowering peak occurring in April, anthesis duration was 15 h and predominantly nocturnal (9 h), pollen was released at 23:00 h, nectar was produced throughout anthesis, and breeding system was self-incompatible. Flower production per plant was similar in disturbed and conserved sites, but ﬂower availability was higher (because of higher tree density) and longer in disturbed sites. Pollination is nocturnal, the most frequent legitimate pollinator being the bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae; diurnal pollination is rare but possible, carried out by bee species. Fruit and seed set in control and nocturnal pollination treatments at disturbed sites were higher than in conserved sites. Frequency of L. yerbabuenae visits was similar among site types, but more visits of complementary nocturnal and diurnal pollinators were recorded in disturbed sites, which could explain differences in reproductive success.",

Our study provides pre-WNS (2009) capture rates and roosting-behavior data for Northern Long-eared Bats in the southern Appalachians. We conducted mist-net surveys at 37 sites and radio-tracked female Northern Long-eared Bats to their day roosts in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. We compared tree and plot characteristics for roosts and corresponding random trees using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Our 43 survey nights yielded 302 bats of 11 species; Northern Long-eared Bats were the most commonly captured species (n = 97). We located 14 unique roosts for 7 radio-tracked bats; Pinus strobus (White Pine) snags (n = 8) were the most common roost sites. We observed a colony of 72 bats using a White Pine snag as a maternity roost. Roost trees were significantly larger in diameter and had more solar exposure above the roost and within the plot than random trees. Our data show the high abundance of Northern Long-eared Bats pre-WNS, highlight the use of White Pine roosts in an area impacted by a Dendroctonus frontalis (Southern Pine Beetle) outbreak, and support previous determinations of roost-selection flexibility by Northern Long-eared Bats across their range.",

To better assess the diversity of bats in the region, we conducted full-spectrum acoustic surveys at several sites in Yukon, Canada. During our surveys we obtained the 1st acoustic records of Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus) and Long-Legged Myotis (Myotis volans) in Yukon. Neither species had been documented previously in the territory, but one or both species were known from adjacent Alaska, British Columbia, and Northwest Territories. Characteristics of certain echolocation calls of Hoary Bats and Long-legged Myotis are difficult to confuse with other species that might also occur in the region. In addition, we made other noteworthy recordings; however, species identification for these other echolocation calls was ambiguous. These 1st records significantly increase our knowledge of the ranges of these bat species in Yukon, Canada. Further acoustic surveys, coupled with live captures, will help us further understand the diversity and distribution of bats in Yukon.",

We explored the importance of pollinator shifts in explaining ﬂoral divergence among 15 species of Iochroma. We examined four continuously varying ﬂoral traits: corolla length, nectar reward, display size, and ﬂower color. Pollinator associations were characterized with a continuously varying measure of pollinator importance (the product of visitation and pollen deposition) for four groups of pollinators: hummingbirds, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. A phylogenetic generalized least squares approach was used to estimate correlations between pollinator groups and ﬂoral traits across a sample of Bayesian trees using different models of trait evolution. Multivariate analyses were also employed to identify suites of traits associated with each pollinator group. We found that nonphylogenetic models typically ﬁt the data better than phylogenetic models (Brownian motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck), and thus results varied little across trees. Our results indicated that species with high nectar reward and large displays are signiﬁcantly more likely to be pollinated by hummingbirds and less likely to be pollinated by all groups of insects. Corolla length and ﬂower color did not show any consistently signiﬁcant associations with pollinator groups. For these two traits, we discuss alternative evolutionary forces, including phylogenetic inertia and community-level factors.",

This study used auditory brainstem responses to measure temporal masking effects in the free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis. A digital subtraction protocol was used to isolate responses to the second of a pair of pulses varying in interval, revealing a suppression phase lasting <4 ms followed by an enhancement phase lasting 4–15 ms during which the ABR waveform was ampliﬁed up to 100%. The results suggest echolocating bats possess adaptations for enhancing sonar receiver gain shortly after pulse emission.",

In this work, we studied the pollination biology and the breeding system of\n              Harrisia portoricensis\n              , an island columnar cactus, to test for the presence of inbreeding and inbreeding depression. For\n              H. portoricensis\n              , which bears flowers with typical outcrossing morphology, the results from 322 h of direct observations and videotaping showed that visits to flowers by animals were uncommon. Controlled pollinations demonstrated that\n              H. portoricensis\n              has a partially self‐compatible breeding system that it is not autogamous and thus requires an external mechanism for the movement of pollen to set fruit. We detected differences in seed size, seed mass, germination success, and multiplicative fitness estimates between self‐ and cross‐pollination treatments. We found that progeny resulting from natural and self‐pollination treatments showed signs of inbreeding depression compared with progeny resulting from cross‐pollination; however, the magnitude of the inbreeding depression was less than 50%. Our combined results suggest that for this species an endogamous breeding system should be favored by natural selection.",

Seven species were recorded, of which three are new records for Rosario. One representative colony was chosen for intensive ecological study. ApproximateJy 64 000 Tadarida brasiJiensis forrned a matemity colony in the attic of an old building. Most of the bats were pregnant or lactat­ ing females and their young.. Adults arrive in the colony in mid-September and ¡eave in February, no bats were present at tbis site from the beginning of March to mid-September. Births occur between mid-November and mid-December. Pups roosted in compact c1usters in the nursery areas, spatially segregated from adults. Densities of these aggregations were 643 ± 76 bats/m2 (p < 0.20). and adult densitíes were 161 ± 21 bats/m2 (p < 0.20). 182 bats were captured. They were sexed and weighed. Mean adult females mass was, 13.26g before parturition and 12.01g after parturition. Recorded data inc1uded daily activity pattems.. Barn Owls (Tyto alba) and domes­ tic cats prey on bats leaving the colony. Rabies virus was no! detected. T he insect biological control exerted by this colony was estimated and it would be of 209 to 385 kg of insects nightly between September and late February, demonstrating the important role they play in the urban ecosistem.",

To examine the consequences of fragmentation and limited dispersal on patterns of genetic structure and variation, we used microsatellite markers to screen bats from around 50% of the known maternity colonies in Britain, and two areas from continental Europe. Analyses revealed that Welsh and English colonies were genetically isolated. This, and lower variability in Britain than north France, may result from either genetic drift, or the species’ colonization history. Gene ﬂow among most neighbouring colonies was not generally restricted, with one exception. These ﬁndings have important implications for the ongoing conservation management of this species.",

Protection improves with increasing knowledge of the biology and ecology of these species. However, species numbers rapidly increase with the ongoing description of cryptic species, resulting in a lack of ecological knowledge for each of these species. We studied the nutritional ecology of three cryptic bat species of the Myotis mystacinus group using stable isotope analysis and molecular fecal analysis. Inter- and intraspecific variations were compared by calculating the isotopic and dietary niches for each species. We hypothesized (a) that all three species are generalists, but (b) that M. mystacinus and Myotis brandtii are more similar to each other than to Myotis alcathoe. Third we assumed that the occupied niches are intraspecifically more similar than interspecifically. We could show that the members of the M. mystacinus group differ in their nutritional ecology. Our data suggest that M. alcathoe is the most specialized species of the group, occupying a more distinct ecological niche compared to the other two species. Interestingly, the dietary and isotopic niche overlap was higher interspecifically than intraspecifically. Furthermore, considering our findings and those from other studies we illustrate implications for the conservation of these cryptic species.",

Two dedicated field trips revealed two new\n                    P. cavernis\n                    sites. In Texas, we found 87% out of eight sites negative for\n                    P. cavernis\n                    . However, this more likely reflects rarity than low discovery effort, because in one large population (>1000 individuals) in Sonora, putatively negative records occurred at only 31% of 16 sampling dates. Currently, live individuals of\n                    P. cavernis\n                    are known from only one cave in the United States and one in Mexico.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Protecting these existing sites is necessary to preserve this charismatic animal but it should not release us from aiming to discover new sites.",

The bat treated in vivo with ﬂutamide, an androgen antagonist, showed loss of spermatozoa at the storage site, utero-tubal junction. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed the presence of increased expression of Bcl2 in the epithelial cell lining of the utero-tubal junction during the period of spermstorage. Treatment with testosterone in vitro caused a signiﬁcant dose-dependent increase in expression of the survival factor Bcl2, whereas treatment with ﬂutamide together with testosterone caused a signiﬁcant decline in Bcl2 in the utero-tubal junction of S. heathii. Together with the expression of Bcl2, the utero-tubal junction also expresses the death signal, caspase3. Expression of caspase3 decreased during January, but increased in February during the late stage of sperm storage. Androgen stimulated Bcl2 synthesis in the utero-tubal junction via the non-genomic MAP kinase signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that androgen promotes sperm storage in S. heathii by stimulating the survival factor Bcl2 in the utero-tubal junction. It is further hypothesized that a balance between the survival factor, Bcl2, and the death signal, caspase3, determines the duration of sperm storage in S. heathii.",

In order to understand how sperm storage in the female genital tract of the vespertilionid bat,\n                Scotophilus heathi\n                (Greater yellow bat), is controlled, we compared concentrations of glucose and the fatty‐acid carrier carnitine in the blood, and carnitine concentrations and levels of expression of the glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the carnitine transporter OCTN2 in the utero‐tubal junction of females during non‐storage (early winter) and sperm‐storage periods (late winter‐early spring). During the sperm‐storage period (December–January) blood glucose concentrations declined, as did the expression of GLUT3 and GLUT5 in the utero‐tubal junction. At the same time there were increases in the concentration of carnitine, and expression of OCTN2 and hormone‐sensitive lipase (HSL) in the utero‐tubal junction. These results suggest that prolonged sperm storage is enhanced by decreased glucose availability but increased free fatty acid availability at the site of sperm storage.

The naming of these new taxa has important bearings in conservation, as this is the first step needed for them to be recognised by the scientific community but also legally. The naming of new animal species, however, needs to follow the strict rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in order to be available and to provide a stable basis for further taxonomic research. We report here a case where new names have been improperly proposed to designate distinctive lineages in the Natterer's bat species complex. As these new names do not follow several mandatory rules imposed by the Code, they are declared unavailable and are not to be used for further taxonomy studies.",

Phylogenetic methods in combination with divergence time estimation can reveal biogeographical centres of origin, differentiate between hypotheses of vicariance and dispersal, and reveal the directionality of dispersal events. Despite their power, however, phylogenetic methods can sometimes yield patterns that are compatible with multiple, equally well-supported biogeographical hypotheses. In such cases, additional approaches must be integrated to differentiate among conflicting dispersal hypotheses. Here, we use a synthetic approach that draws upon the analytical strengths of coalescent and population genetic methods to augment phylogenetic analyses in order to assess the biogeographical history of Madagascar’s Triaenops bats (Chiroptera: Hipposideridae). Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data for Malagasy and east African Triaenops reveal a pattern that equally supports two competing hypotheses. While the phylogeny cannot determine whether Africa or Madagascar was the centre of origin for the species investigated, it serves as the essential backbone for the application of coalescent and population genetic methods. From the application of these methods, we conclude that a hypothesis of two independent but unidirectional dispersal events from Africa to Madagascar is best supported by the data.",

Taxa include T. persicus from east Africa and three Triaenops species from Madagascar (T. auritus, T. furculus, and T. rufus). The evolution of this bat family considerably post-dated the tectonic division of Madagascar from Africa, excluding vicariance as a viable hypothesis. Therefore, we consider three biogeographical scenarios to explain these species’ current ranges: (A) a single dispersal from Africa to Madagascar with subsequent speciation of the Malagasy species; (B) multiple, unidirectional dispersals from Africa to Madagascar resulting in multiple, independent Malagasy lineages; or (C) early dispersal of a proto-species from Africa to Madagascar, with later back-dispersal of a descendant Malagasy taxon to Africa.",

Histoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent systemic mycoses in the Americas and occurs in several mammalian species. Bats are important in the epidemiological cycle of histoplasmosis because they disseminate the fungus throughout the environment. The aim of the present study was to investigate natural H. capsulatum infection in bats located in forested areas, which have undergone anthropogenic perturbations, as well as in the urban areas of the state of Pará. Twenty-two species of bats were captured in 18 municipalities of Pará; the samples obtained from these animals were subjected to nested PCR for amplification of H. capsulatum DNA. The HCI/HCII and HCIII/HCIV primers were used, and the final 210-pb fragment was amplified. Of the 100 bats analysed, two were confirmed to be positive for H. capsulatum. Samples amplified by nested PCR were sequenced and found to share identity and have 100% match with H. capsulatum DNA. H. capsulatum was detected in the area of study: the state of Pará has a wide diversity of bat species, and the region under investigation is situated in the north of the state, which suffers the most severe environmental and climatic changes. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the distribution of H. capsulatum hosts in this region to facilitate the implementation of effective disease surveillance.",

Switching behaviour was common to both sexes and did not depend on group size. We observed both individual and group switching, the latter often involving the abandonment of a roost tree on a single night. We suggest that behaviours such as flight activity around roosts or cavity inspection by bats play a role in recruiting group mates and coordinating their occupation of another site. Bats almost never crossed mountain ridges to use roosts located beyond them, possibly because ridges are regarded as boundaries delimiting main roosting areas. The rate of switching was lowest during the middle of the lactation period, probably to minimise problems related to the transportation of non‐volant young by their mothers. Although the maintenance of social relationship among bats spread over large forest areas may partly explain the occurrence of roost switching, the persistence of this behaviour in solitary bats and the movement of entire groups best fit the hypothesis that roost switching represents a way to maintain or increase knowledge of alternative roosts.",

Herein, we provide the first account on prevalence and phenology of P. destructans in Poland. Bats were counted once per month, from October or January to May (2010-2013), in an abandoned ore mine in southern Poland. Presence of P. destructans in two samples was confirmed by sequencing of isolated fungal DNA. Observations of phenotypically identical mycosis on bats hibernating at this site in March 2006 are likely to be the first known records of P. destructans from Poland. All Pd-suspected individuals were Myotis myotis with an exception of one Myotis daubentonii. The first Pd-suspected bats were noted in mid-February, but their number was the highest in March, what overlapped with maximum numbers of hibernating M. myotis. The prevalence in March was 7%-27% of M. myotis individuals. No mass mortality of bats was observed in the mine, with only three dead individuals found in the hibernaculum which hosted up to 130 bats, representing 6-7 species.",

            "abstractNote": "Hibernation is a strategy used by some mammals to survive harsh winter conditions. Many small mammals, such as the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, enter a long-term state of hibernation characterized by a period of deep torpor that can range from days to weeks. Torpid bats undergo metabolic rate depression that not only results in physiological changes but also promotes biochemical changes that favor survival. The present study utilizes multiplex technology to assess key early apoptosis markers and a select group of antioxidant enzymes in muscle, heart, and liver in euthermic controls and torpid bats. Muscle showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p53 and the antioxidant enzyme catalase but a signiﬁcant increase in peroxiredoxin 2 levels. The heart responded similarly, with most proapoptotic proteins (caspase 8/9 and p53) remaining at low levels, while the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein signiﬁcantly increased during torpor. There was no signiﬁcant change in the antioxidant enzymes measured during torpor in the heart compared with the controls. The liver showed increases in catalase and Mn superoxide dismutase 2 enzymes during torpor, which correlated with activation of select antiapoptotic proteins and suppression of levels of proapoptotic ones. Overall, our data demonstrate that antiapoptotic and antioxidant defense responses have organ-speciﬁc regulation during torpor in bats. The induction of key antioxidant enzymes and antiapoptotic proteins may function as protective mechanisms that are necessary for surviving torpor.",

For hoary bats, Lasiurus cinereus, their ecology is largely known from summer with the exception that they move long distances during autumn and spring and maintain some level of activity year-round. Autumn is a critically important period for hoary bats as they complete long-distance migrations between summer and winter range and they mate, both of which are energetically expensive. We studied hoary bat roost selection during autumn in a migratory stopover area in redwood habitat in northwestern California. We hypothesized that hoary bats select day roosts during autumn migration that minimize energetic expenditures and improve mating opportunities. We located 24 day roost sites of male hoary bats and evaluated site-level roost selection by comparing roosts with 120 random locations. We used multiple logistic regression to compare remotely sensed habitat features derived from LiDAR and other spatial data. The three most important variables for distinguishing roost from random locations were distance to creek, roads, and meadow. We speculate that selection of roosts in proximity to open spaces and flyways facilitated social behaviors related to mating that are commonly observed in this area.",

It evolved from a continental ancestor related to the Leisler’s bat Nyctalus leisleri and is considered threatened because of its restricted and highly fragmented distribution. We studied the genetic variability in 159 individuals from 14 colonies sampled throughout the archipelago. Sequences of the D-loop region revealed moderate but highly structured genetic variability. Half of the 15 distinct haplotypes were restricted to a single island, but the most common was found throughout the archipelago, suggesting a single colonization event followed by limited interisland female gene flow. All N. azoreum haplotypes were closely related and formed a star-like structure typical of expanded populations. The inferred age of demographic expansions was consistent with the arrival of founder animals during the Holocene, well before the first humans inhabited the Azores. Comparisons with a population of N. leisleri from continental Portugal confirmed not only that all N. azoreum lineages were unique to the archipelago, but also that the current levels of genetic diversity were surprisingly high for an insular species. Our data imply that the Azorean bat has a high conservation value. We argue that geographical patterns of genetic structuring indicate the existence of two management units.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are distributed worldwide from tropical to temperate regions. Despite their wide geographical radiation and advances in studies using evolutionary approaches, aspects related to the reproduction of these animals remain poorly explored, especially those related to the male reproductive accessory glands (RAGs). Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the morphophysiology of the male RAGs in the bat Artibeus lituratus. The RAGs in A. lituratus are composed of a compact intraabdominal glandular complex, consisting of the prostate with two prostatic regions (ventral and dorsal), plus Littre glands and a pair of extra-abdominal bulbourethral glands. The ventral region of the prostate has an epithelium with variable morphology, due to its holocrine type of secretion. In contrast, the dorsal region has a typical cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium. Both regions contain two cell types, basal and secretory cells. Similar to the epithelial morphology, the secretion also varies, with the ventral region containing numerous PAS-positive globular vesicles, whereas the dorsal region has a more fluid, hyaline and PAS-negative secretion. Littre glands are dispersed in the connective tissue of the urethra, while the bulbourethral glands are located in the penile root, both glands with cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium and globular PASpositive secretion. The results demonstrate that the RAGs of A. lituratus are composed of two prostatic regions, ventral and dorsal, and urethral and bulbourethral glands, with no seminal vesicles. Each prostatic region has unique and distinctive characteristics, with the ventral region presenting an exclusive holocrine nature and the dorsal region having similarities to the ventral prostate of rodents.",

This sequence was placed with Vespertilio sinensis (Asian parti-colored bat) in a COI gene tree but with Hypsugo alashanicus (Alashanian pipistrelle) in a cytochrome b gene tree. Direct comparison of mitogenomes showed that 92.4% of this mitogenome is similar to Vespertilio sinensis, 5.9% to Hypsugo alaschanicus, and that 1.6% of the mitogenome could not be attributed to either species, or any other species. This mitogenome has been re-used in at least 17 phylogenies. Our findings suggest that mitogenomes are best verified with multiple gene trees, followed by direct comparison of sequences. We conclude that greater vigilance is warranted to ensure that problematic sequences do not enter the scientific record, and are not re-used in subsequent studies.",

The uteri of 30 sexually mature adult females, five specimens for each of the six sample groups (NON, nonreproductive; P1, initial pregnancy; P2, intermediate pregnancy; P3, advanced pregnancy; LAC, lactating; P + LAC, pregnant-lactating), were submitted to analyses of serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations, in addition to immunohistochemical analyses. Both estradiol and progesterone, gradually increased during pregnancy, with a marked significant increase in P3 females. Both returned to low levels in LAC-females; however, estradiol levels decreased further in P + LAC-females, while progesterone increased in the same group. In general, signs indicative of aromatase expression were observed in the endometrium of all analyzed groups and in the placenta of bats in the gestation groups. Similarly, ERα and PR were expressed in the myometrium, endometrium and placenta at varying levels of intensity. The results indicate that the uterine microenvironment of A. lituratus is directly regulated by serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone, and fluctuations in these concentrations control morphological and physiological changes of this organ during different phases of the reproductive cycle.",

This report describes the management and evaluation of a group of straw-colored fruit bats, Eidolon helvum, that were exposed to carbaryl. Cholinesterase activity of blood, retina, and brain was evaluated to further investigate whether carbaryl was the causative agent. Decreased whole blood and retinal cholinesterase activity coupled with the response to atropine suggests that the cause of the clinical signs in this bat colony was due to carbaryl exposure. Whole blood and retinal tissue may be the best samples for conﬁrming carbamate exposure in this species.",

Grisebach in the biome of the Atlantic rain forest, southern Brazil. On Santa Catarina Island, ﬂowering extends from mid-September to the end of December, with diurnal anthesis. The reproductive system is obligatory xenogamy, thus pollinator-dependent. Flowers secrete 31.84 ll of nectar per day, with a mean sugar concentration of 23.2%. Highest nectar volume and sugar concentration occur at the beginning of anthesis. Most ﬂoral traits are characteristic for ornithophily, and nectar production appears to be adapted to the energy demand of hummingbirds. Continued secretion of the sucrose-dominated nectar attracts and binds visitors to inﬂorescences, strengthening trapline foraging behaviour. Experiments assessing seed set after single ﬂower visits were performed with the most frequent visitors, revealing the hummingbird Thalurania glaucopis as the most effective pollen vector. In addition, bees are also functional pollinators, as substantiated by their high visitation frequency. We conclude that this pollination system is bimodal. Thus, there is redundancy in the pollination service provided by birds and bees, granting a high probability of successful reproduction in Ae. nudicaulis.",

Because the immune system is energetically costly, spleen size is expected to be condition-dependent. Parasites also can influence spleen size. Parasites draw resources from their host, with consequences for host body condition. Male American mink (Neovison vison) were examined for parasite prevalence, intensity, and richness to test several predictions: individuals in good condition have large spleens; heavily parasitized individuals have large spleens; and heavily parasitized individuals are in poorer condition than individuals with few parasites. Spleen mass was related positively to both body condition and parasite richness, but spleen mass was not associated with prevalence or intensity of individual parasites. Body condition was related weakly to the intensity of parasitism by the giant kidney worm and sinus worm, but otherwise parasite prevalence, intensity, or richness were not associated with body condition. These results are similar to those found in studies of birds, suggesting that comparable processes occur in mammals.",

PAS, Alcian Blue (pH 2.5) and Alcian Blue (pH 1.0) stainings detected only neutral glycoconjugates. Lectin-binding analyses included LTA, UEA-I, ConA, SBA, BSI-B4, AAA, DBA, PNA, and WGA. WGAand PNA-bindings were also tested after β-elimination to detect O-linked glycans. Parietal cells were negative for binding to LTA and UEA-I, and to PNA and WGA after β-elimination, indicating the lack of (1,2) fucosylated residues and of N-linked glycans, respectively. Immunohistochemical tests with anti-α- and anti-β-H+,K+-ATPase were positive. Two alternative patterns of glycoconjugate distribution were found, i.e. a perinuclear and a diffuse one, indicating localization in the intracellular canaliculus and in the tubulovesicular system of the parietal cells, respectively. Both the subunits of the H+,K+-ATPase and the galactosyl/galactosaminyl residues were co-distributed in both the perinuclear and the diffuse patterns, suggesting that the residues are part of the protonic pump. Glycosyl/glycosaminyl and mannosyl groups were concentrated in the tubulovesicular system, and fucosylated residues were found almost exclusively in the intracellular canaliculi; thus they are probably not included in the oligosaccharide chains of β-H+,K+-ATPase. These findings indicate that the oligosaccharide chains linked to the β-H+,K+-ATPase subunit in R. ferrumequinum have distinct features compared to the other mammals studied and confirms the taxon specificity of the chains in the proton pump.",

            "abstractNote": "Most insectivorous bat species in the Neotropical family Phyllostomidae glean insects from ground, water or vegetation surfaces. They use similar and stereotypical echolocation calls that are generally very short (less than 1–3 ms), multi-harmonic and frequency-modulated (FM). By contrast, the common sword-nosed bat,\n              Lonchorhina aurita\n              , which has the longest noseleaf in the entire phyllostomid family, produces distinctly different echolocation calls. They are composed of a constant frequency (CF) component with a peak frequency of 45 kHz, followed by a short FM down-sweep at the end. With a mean call duration of 6.6 ms (max. 8.7 ms) when flying in the open they have the longest echolocation calls reported from phyllostomid bats. In cluttered environments, the CF-component is very short. In open habitats, however,\n              L. aurita\n              can emit pure CF-calls without the terminal FM-component. We also recorded in the field a distinct terminal group that closely resembles the feeding buzzes of aerial hawking bat species from other bat families. This is the first time the echolocation call design of\n              L. aurita\n              is presented. In addition, we contrast the echolocation behaviour of individuals flying in open and confined situations. Our results suggest that the unique echolocation system of\n              L. aurita\n              represents an adaptation to aerial hawking, a very unusual hunting mode within the phyllostomid family.",

            "abstractNote": "Gleaning insectivorous bats that forage by using echolocation within dense forest vegetation face the sensorial challenge of acoustic masking effects. Active perception of silent and motionless prey in acoustically cluttered environments by echolocation alone has thus been regarded impossible. The gleaning insectivorous bat\n              Micronycteris microtis\n              however, forages in dense understory vegetation and preys on insects, including dragonflies, which rest silent and motionless on vegetation. From behavioural experiments, we show that\n              M. microtis\n              uses echolocation as the sole sensorial modality for successful prey perception within a complex acoustic environment. All individuals performed a stereotypical three-dimensional hovering flight in front of prey items, while continuously emitting short, multi-harmonic, broadband echolocation calls. We observed a high precision in target localization which suggests that\n              M. microtis\n              perceives a detailed acoustic image of the prey based on shape, surface structure and material. Our experiments provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that a gleaning bat uses echolocation alone for successful detection, classification and precise localization of silent and motionless prey in acoustic clutter. Overall, we conclude that the three-dimensional hovering flight of\n              M. microtis\n              in combination with a frequent emission of short, high-frequency echolocation calls is the key for active prey perception in acoustically highly cluttered environments.",

            "abstractNote": "This study investigated allozyme and morphometric variability within the genus Cynopterus, with particular emphasis on C. nusatenggara, which is endemic to Wallacea, the area encompassing the Oriental-Australian biogeographic interface. The genetic distances between Cynopterus species are small by mammalian standards and suggest that this genus has undergone a recent series of speciation events. The genetic distance between populations of C. nusatenggara is strongly correlated with both the contemporary sea-crossing distance between islands and the estimated sea crossing at the time of the last Pleistocene glacial maximum, 18,000 B.P. This observation, together with low levels of population substructure within islands as shown by F-statistics, indicates that the sea is a primary and formidable barrier to gene exchange. The genetic distance and the great-circle geographical distance between the populations of C. nusatenggara are not correlated, although a principal-coordinates analysis of genetic distance reveals relationships between the populations that are similar to their geographical arrangement. A strong negative correlation exists between the level of heterozygosity within island populations of C. nusatenggara and the minimum sea-crossing distance to the nearest large source population. This is interpreted as reflecting an isolation effect of the sea, leading to reduced heterozygosity in populations that have larger sea barriers between them and the large source islands. Independently of this, heterozygosity is negatively associated with longitude, which in turn is associated with systematic changes in the environment such as a gradual decline in rainfall from west to east. The association between heterozygosity and longitude is interpreted as reflecting an association between genetic and environmental variance and supports the niche-width theory of genetic variance. Morphometric variability did not show any of the main effects demonstrated in the genetic data. Furthermore, there was no evidence that, at the level of individuals, genetic and morphometric variability were associated.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary Two decades ago D. J. Keegan reported results on Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus, Megachiroptera) that were strangely at odds with the prevailing understanding of how glucose is absorbed in the mammalian intestine. Keegan’s in vitro tests for glucose transport against a concentration gradient and with phloridzin inhibition in fruit bat intestine were all negative, although he used several different tissue preparations and had positive control results with laboratory rats. Because glucose absorption by fruit bats is nonetheless efficient, Keegan postulated that the rapid glucose absorption from the fruit bat intestine is not through the enterocytes, but must occur via spaces between the cells. Thus, we hypothesized that absorption of water-soluble compounds that are not actively transported would be extensive in these bats, and would decline with increasing molecular mass in accord with sieve-like paracellular absorption. We did not presume from Keegan’s studies that there is no Na+-coupled, mediated sugar transport in these bats, and our study was not designed to rule it out, but rather to quantify the level of possible non-mediated absorption. Using a standard pharmacokinetic technique, we fed, or injected intraperitonealy, the metabolically inert carbohydrates Lrhamnose (molecular mass=164·Da) and cellobiose (molecular mass=342·Da), which are absorbed by paracellular uptake, and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3OMDglucose), a D-glucose analog that is absorbed via both mediated (active) and paracellular uptake. As predicted, the bioavailability of paracellular probes declined with increasing molecular mass (rhamnose, 62±4%; cellobiose, 22±4%) and was significantly higher in bats than has been reported for rats and other mammals. In addition, fractional absorption of 3OMD-glucose was high (91±2%). We estimated that Egyptian fruit bats rely on passive, paracellular absorption for the majority of their glucose absorption (at least 55% of 3OMD-glucose absorption), much more than in non-flying mammals.",

The reproductive cycle is characterized by a three-month period of delayed implantation and the total length of pregnancy may be as much as 10 months. A histochemical study of the gonadotrophs and mammotrophs of the anterior pituitary, in conjunction with assays of LH-like, progesterone-like and prolactin-like immunoreactivity in the plasma suggest that during delayed implantation the gonadotrophs were inactive while the mammotrophs were active and plasma PRL-like immunoreactivity high. We interpret this as indicating that, in the straw-coloured fruit bat, implantation was inhibited by high levels of prolactin and, as such, the endocrine control of delayed implantation may be quite different from that described for other mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats account for one-fifth of mammalian species, are the only mammals with powered flight, and are among the few animals that echolocate. The insect-eating Brandt's bat (Myotis brandtii) is the longest-lived bat species known to date (lifespan exceeds 40 years) and, at 4-8 g adult body weight, is the most extreme mammal with regard to disparity between body mass and longevity. Here we report sequencing and analysis of the Brandt's bat genome and transcriptome, which suggest adaptations consistent with echolocation and hibernation, as well as altered metabolism, reproduction and visual function. Unique sequence changes in growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors are also observed. The data suggest that an altered growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 axis, which may be common to other long-lived bat species, together with adaptations such as hibernation and low reproductive rate, contribute to the exceptional lifespan of the Brandt's bat.",

This study attempts to determine reference intervals from a group of 45 captive individuals for a variety of hematologic and biochemistry parameters. Most of the values are similar to values previously seen in other pteropodid bat species. Differences included a lower than expected reference interval for the total white blood cell count, a wider reference interval for glucose, and a higher reference interval for 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Establishing reference intervals for hematologic and biochemistry analytes for bats that were maintained on the same diet and under the same husbandry parameters for several years will help in the future assessment of other bats maintained in a similar manner.",

Light at night is particularly problematic for bats as most species are nocturnal and often cross relatively large distances when commuting between roosts and foraging grounds. Earlier studies have shown that illumination of linear structures in the landscape disturbs commuting bats, and that the response of bats to light may strongly depend on the light spectrum. Here, we studied the impact of white, green, and red light on commuting Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii). We used a unique location where commuting bats cross a road by flying through two identical, parallel culverts underneath. We illuminated the culverts with white, red, and green light, with an intensity of 5 lux at the water surface. Bats had to choose between the two culverts, each with a different lighting condition every night. We presented all paired combinations of white, green, and red light and dark control in a factorial design. Contrary to our expectations, the number of bat passes through a culvert was unaffected by the presence of light. Furthermore, bats did not show any preference for light color. These results show that the response of commuting Daubenton's bats to different colors of light at night with a realistic intensity may be limited when passing through culverts.",

A cartilaginous baculum anlage was evident at late embryonic stages. Initially, the distal part of the baculum develops during embryogenesis as a cartilage. Then the growth of the shaft and formation of the proximal portion occurs and it is shortly followed by ossification of the whole structure. The baculum continues to grows during the first months of the postnatal life and its length is correlated with that of the forearm. The baculum reaches its definitive shape and size by the age of 1.5 month in N. noctula and two months in V. murinus. Therefore, after this time period, the shape and size of the baculum cannot be used for age determination.",

Data indicate that in the summer roosts a high dominance of beetles (Coleoptera) accounted for 77 and 89% of the recovered items by volume, while in the maternity roost 86% of the volume belongs to the beetles. Prey types recovered in the summer quarters which were not represented in the maternity roost included small numbers of Diptera, Neuroptera and Hymenoptera.",

Physiological responses of species highly susceptible to pathogen infections following invasion are well described. However, the responses of less susceptible species (relative to highly susceptible species) are not well known. Latitudinal gradients, which can influence body condition via Bergmann's rule and/or reflect the time it takes for an introduced pathogen to spread geographically, add an additional layer for how mammalian species respond to pathogen exposure. Our goal was to understand how hosts less susceptible to pathogen infections respond to long‐term pathogen exposure across a broad latitudinal gradient. We examined changes in body mass throughout pathogen exposure time across the eastern United States (latitude ranging 30.5° N–44.8° N) in\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              , a bat species classified as less susceptible to infection (relative to highly susceptible species) by the invasive fungal pathogen that causes white‐nose syndrome,\n              Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n              (\n              Pd\n              ). Using 30 years of spring through fall adult capture records, we created linear mixed‐effects models for female and male bats to determine how mass or mass variation changed across the eastern United States from pre‐\n              Pd\n              invasion years through\n              Pd\n              invasion (0–1 years with\n              Pd\n              ), epidemic (2–4 years with\n              Pd\n              ), and established years (5+ years with\n              Pd\n              ). By\n              Pd\n              establishment, all female and male bats decreased body mass with increasing latitude across a spatial threshold at 39.6° N. Differences in bat mass north and south of the spatial threshold progressively increased over\n              Pd\n              exposure time‐steps such that body mass was lower in northern latitudes compared to southern latitudes by\n              Pd\n              establishment. Results indicated that the progressive differences in\n              E. fuscus\n              body mass with latitude across the eastern United States are due to long‐term pathogen exposure; however, other environmental and ecological pressures may contribute to decreases in\n              E. fuscus\n              body mass with latitude and long‐term pathogen exposure. As pathogen introductions and emerging infectious diseases become more prevalent on the landscape, it is imperative that we understand how less susceptible species directly and indirectly respond to long‐term pathogen exposure in order to maintain population health in surviving species.",

At a macroevolutionary scale, there is evidence that evolutionary changes in the anatomical elements involved in producing bite force have contributed to dietary diversification in mammals. Much less is known about how these elements change over postnatal ontogeny. Mammalian diets drastically shift over ontogeny—from drinking mother's milk to feeding on adult foods—presumably with equally drastic changes in the morphology of the feeding apparatus and bite performance. Here, we investigate ontogenetic morphological changes in the insectivorous big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), which has an extreme, positive allometric increase in bite force during development. Using contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography scans of a developmental series from birth to adult morphology, we quantified skull shape and measured skeletal and muscular parameters directly related to bite force production. We found pronounced changes in the skull over ontogeny, including a large increase in the volume of the temporalis and masseter muscles, and an expansion of the skull dome and sagittal crest that would serve to increase the temporalis attachment area. These changes indicate that development of the jaw adductors play an important role in the development of biting performance of these bats. Notably, static bite force increases with positive allometry with respect to all anatomical measures examined, suggesting that modifications in biting dynamics and/or improved motor coordination also contribute to increases in biting performance.",

            "abstractNote": "Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis that occurs in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Chiroptera are known to be a formidable reservoir of zoonotic pathogens, including leptospires. The epidemiology of leptospirosis in bats in the Pacific Islands is poorly known, both in terms of prevalence and in terms of the bacterial strains involved. A strong host specificity between leptospiral strains and their mammalian reservoir is recognized. This phenomenon has notably been studied recently in bat communities, providing strong evidence of co-evolution. In New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot where leptospirosis is endemic and enzootic, Chiroptera are the only indigenous terrestrial mammals. In this study, we aimed to investigate leptospires associated with three flying fox species in New Caledonia. Kidneys and urine samples of Pteropus spp. from captures and seizures were analysed. Among 254 flying foxes analysed, 24 harboured pathogenic leptospires corresponding to an observed prevalence of 9.45% with 15.8% on the Main Island and 4.3% on Loyalty Islands. The analysis of the rrs gene, lfb1, and MLST sequences evidenced four distinct clusters of undescribed strains, likely corresponding to undescribed species. All four strains belong to the Group I of pathogenic Leptospira spp., which includes Leptospira interrogans, Leptospira noguchii, and Leptospira kirschneri. We detected pathogenic leptospires in all three Pteropus spp. studied (including two endemic species) with no evidence of host specificity in two co-roosting species. For a better understanding of Leptospira–host co-evolution, notably to genetically characterize and evaluate the virulence of these original bat-associated leptospires, it is essential to improve isolation techniques. Flying foxes are traditionally hunted and eaten in New Caledonia, a massive cause of bat–human interactions. Our results should encourage vigilance during these contacts to limit the spillover risk of these pathogens to humans.",

This bat species is the smallest hipposideros in China so far with 32.4 –36.0 mm forearm and 3.7 – 4.5 body mass. The noseleaf is relatively simple that its anterior leaf is without a median emargination or supplementary lateral leaflets. The intermediate leaf has four glands with long vibrissae. The posterior leaf possesses three poorly developed septa, dividing it into four cells. The internarial septum is inflated and bulbous. The ear is relatively large, slight beyond the end of muzzle when laid forward. This bat species is the first record from this country. The specimens were preserved in Guangdong Entomological Institute.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats at northern latitudes need to cope with long periods of no food for large parts of the year. Hence, bats which are resident at northern latitudes throughout the year will need to undergo a long hibernation season and a short reproductive season where foraging time is limited by extended daylight periods. Eptesicus nilssonii is the northernmost occurring bat species worldwide and hibernates locally when ambient temperatures (Ta) limit prey availability. Therefore, we investigated the energy spent maintaining normothermy at different Ta, as well as how much bats limit energy expenditure while in torpor. We found that, despite being exposed to Ta as low as 1.1°C, bats did not increase torpid metabolic rate, thus indicating that E. nilssonii can survive and hibernate at low ambient temperatures. Furthermore, we found a lower critical temperature (Tlc) of 27.8°C, which is lower than in most other vespertilionid bats, and we found no indication of any metabolic response to Ta up to 37.1°C. Interestingly, carbon dioxide production increased with increasing Ta above the Tlc, presumably caused by a release of retained CO2 in bats that remained in torpor for longer and aroused at Ta above the Tlc. Our results indicate that E. nilssonii can thermoconform at near-freezing Ta, and hence maintain longer torpor bouts with limited energy expenditure, yet also cope with high Ta when sun exposed in roosts during long summer days. These physiological traits are likely to enable the species to cope with ongoing and predicted climate change.",

            "abstractNote": "Most lyssaviruses appear to have bat species as reservoir hosts. In Europe, of around 800 reported cases in bats, most were of European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) in Eptesicus serotinus (where the bat species was identiﬁed). About 20 cases of EBLV-2 were recorded, and these were in Myotis daubentonii and M. dasycneme. Through a passive surveillance scheme, Britain reports about one case a year of EBLV-2, but no cases of the more prevalent EBLV-1. An analysis of E. serotinus and M. daubentonii bat genetics in Britain reveals more structure in the former population than in the latter. Here we brieﬂy review these diﬀerences, ask if this correlates with dispersal and movement patterns and use the results to suggest an hypothesis that EBLV-2 is more common than EBLV-1 in the UK, as genetic data suggest greater movement and regular immigration from Europe of M. daubentonii. We further suggest that this genetic approach is useful to anticipate the spread of exotic diseases in bats in any region of the world.",

DSC has only been observed in one member of the Neotropical Mormoopidae, a family of bats that use pulses with prominent CF components, leading researchers to suspect that DSC is a uniquely derived trait in the single species Pteronotus parnellii. Yet recent phylogenetic data indicate that the lineage of P. parnellii originates from the most basal node in the evolutionary history of the genus Pteronotus. DSC behavior was investigated in another member of this family, Pteronotus personatus, because molecular data indicated that this species stems from the second most basal node in Pteronotus. DSC was tested for by swinging the bats on a pendulum. P. personatus performed DSC as well as P. parnellii under identical conditions. Two other closely related mormoopids, Pteronotus davyi and Mormoops megalophylla, were also tested and neither shifted the peak frequency of their pulses. These results shed light on the evolutionary history of DSC among the mormoopids.",

            "abstractNote": "The purpose of this data set was to compile body mass information for all mammals on Earth so that we could investigate the patterns of body mass seen across geographic and taxonomic space and evolutionary time. We were interested in the heritability of body size across taxonomic groups (How conserved is body mass within a genus, family, and order?), in the overall pattern of body mass across continents (Do the moments and other descriptive statistics remain the same across geographic space?), and over evolutionary time (How quickly did body mass patterns iterate on the patterns seen today? Were the Pleistocene extinctions size specific on each continent, and did these events coincide with the arrival of man?). These data are also part of a larger project that seeks to integrate body mass patterns across very diverse taxa (NCEAS Working Group on Body Size in Ecology and Paleoecology: linking pattern and process across space, time, and taxonomic scales). We began with the updated version of D. E. Wilson and D. M. Reeder's taxonomic list of all known Recent mammals of the world (N = 4629 species) to which we added status, distribution, and body mass estimates compiled from the primary and secondary literature. Whenever possible, we used an average of male and female body mass, which was in turn averaged over multiple localities to arrive at our species body mass values. The sources are line referenced in the main data set, with the actual references appearing in a table within the metadata. Mammals have individual records for each continent they occur on. Note that our data set is more than an amalgamation of smaller compilations. Although we relied heavily on a data set for Chiroptera by K. E. Jones (N = 905), the CRC handbook of Mammalian Body Mass (N = 688), and a data set compiled for South America by P. Marquet (N = 505), these represent less than half the records in the current database. The remainder are derived from more than 150 other sources. Furthermore, we include a comprehensive late Pleistocene species assemblage for Africa, North and South America, and Australia (an additional 230 species). \"Late Pleistocene\" is defined as approximately 11 ka for Africa, North and South America, and as 50 ka for Australia, because these times predate anthropogenic impacts on mammalian fauna. Estimates contained within this data set represent a generalized species value, averaged across sexes and geographic space. Consequently, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of body mass with specific environmental conditions is important. All extant orders of mammals are included, as well as several archaic groups (N = 4859 species). Because some species are found on more than one continent (particularly Chiroptera), there are 5731 entries. We have body masses for the following: Artiodactyla (280 records), Bibymalagasia (2 records), Carnivora (393 records), Cetacea (75 records), Chiroptera (1071 records), Dasyuromorphia (67 records), Dermoptera (3 records), Didelphimorphia (68 records), Diprotodontia (127 records), Hydracoidea (5 records), Insectivora (234 records), Lagomorpha (53 records), Litopterna (2 records), Macroscelidea (14 records), Microbiotheria (I record), Monotremata (7 records), Notoryctemorphia (1 record), Notoungulata (5 records), Paucituberculata (5 records), Peramelemorphia (24 records), Perissodactyla (47 records), Pholidota (8 records), Primates (276 records), Proboscidea (14 records), Rodentia (1425 records), Scandentia (15 records), Sirenia (6 records), Tubulidentata (1 record), and Xenarthra (75 records).",

Bats in captivity were sampled every 7–21 days over a 1-year period. The data revealed ﬁve NiV serological patterns categorized as high and low positives, waning, decreasing and increasing, and negative in these individuals. The ﬁndings strongly suggest that NiV circulates in wild bat populations and that antibody could be maintained for long periods. The study also found that pup and juvenile bats from seropositive dams tested seropositive, indicating that maternal antibodies against NiV are transmitted passively, and in this study population may last up to 14 months. NiV was isolated from the urine of one bat, and within a few weeks, two other seronegative bats seroconverted. Based on the temporal cluster of seroconversion, we strongly believe that the NiV isolated was recrudesced and then transmitted horizontally between bats during the study period.",

These approaches are robust and can be useful to also validate the status of species that are uncommon and underrepresented in biological collections. We examined the species limits and validated the taxonomic status of the Minor Red Bat (\n            Lasiurus minor\n            ), an uncommon species originally described from four specimens. Our approach consisted of three independent lines of evidence combining genetic and phenotypic data. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the uniqueness of\n            L. minor\n            compared to three other geographically and closely related Red Bat species. Furthermore, coalescent species delimitation supported the four Red Bat species hypothesis. Linear phenotypic analyses demonstrated that\n            L. minor\n            is distinct from other Red Bats despite a morphological continuum. Finally, we reassessed the diagnosability of characters used to describe\n            L. minor\n            using an objective shape analysis approach, which emphasized the support for this taxon. Based on our findings, while identification in the field could still pose a challenge, there is strong support to recognize\n            L. minor\n            . This study settles a longstanding taxonomic question and provides evidence to better understand Caribbean biodiversity.",

Subsequently, the latter taxon was included under the former as a subspecies. Owing to disjunct distribution, it was speculated that these two taxa are distinct. Discovery of the type material and additional vouchers of both taxa in the National Collection of Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata allowed detailed comparison. Based on the morphological, craniodental and bacular characters, we establish the distinctness of these taxa. A redescription of H. pomona Andersen, 1918 is provided.",

Geoffrey), captured from May 1994 to May 1995 from a roost in Jenkins County, GA. Six species of mites were found infesting the bats, representing 5 families: Macronyssidae, Cheyletidae, Sarcoptidae, Rosensteiniidae, and Uropodidae. The macronyssid mite Chiroptonyssus robustipes (Ewing) and the hemipteran bat bug, Cimex adjunctu« (Barber), were collected from the host and the roost. C. robustipes was the most abundant mite (2,508 specimens) and the macronyssid Steatonyssus ceratognathus (Ewing) (189 specimens) was the 2nd most abundant mite found infesting the bats. The predatory cheyletid mite Cheyletonella vespertilionis Womersley (51 specimens) was also collected from the bats, and this is thought to be the 1st report of this mite from Georgia. 10 addition, Teinocaptes sp. (Sarcoptidae, 8 specimens), Nycteriglyphus sp. (Rosensteiniidae, 8 specimens), and uropodid mites (5 specimens) were removed from the bats. Of the 45 bats examined, all 30 females and 14 of 15 males were infested with C. robustipes. Twenty-three bat anatomical areas were designated and all C. robustipes mites were counted to ascertain anatomical preference. This mite was significantly more abundant on the ventral wing membrane areas posterior to the radiusulna and on the lower torso. Protonymphs of C. robustipes predominated on the wing membranes of the bats, whereas adult mites were more concentrated on the torso and head.",

The purpose of our study was to assess the relative importance of drift, gene flow, and spatially varying selection in shaping patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation across a latitudinal climatic gradient in peninsular India. At a microgeographic scale, polygynous mating resulted in a substantial reduction of effective population size. However, at a macrogeographic scale, rates of migration were sufficiently high to prevent a pronounced degree of stochastic differentiation via drift. Spatial analysis of genetic and phenotypic differentiation revealed that clinal variation in body size of C. sphinx cannot be explained by a neutral model of isolation by distance. The geographic patterning of morphometric variation is most likely attributable to spatially varying selection and/or the direct influence of latitudinally ordered environmental effects. The combined analysis of genetic and phenotypic variation indicates that recognized subspecies of C. sphinx in peninsular India represent arbitrary subdivisions of a continuous spectrum of clinal size variation.",

            "abstractNote": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of changes in body mass, fat reserves and feeding activity on circulating levels of lipids, glucose, protein and metabolic hormones in a vespertilionid bat, Scotophilus heathi. Furthermore, the relationship between changes in metabolic factors and hormones with the unique reproductive features of female S. heathi was also examined. The results of this study showed annual variation in body mass, fat reserve and feeding activity, which correlated signiﬁcantly with circulating levels of lipids, protein and metabolic hormones. Increased corticosterone level during September–October in S. heathi promotes increased feeding activity, which in turn induces hyperinsulinemia in S. heathi during November. Hyperinsulinemia together with low body temperature in November facilitates fat accumulation in bat. Coinciding with the period of fat accumulation raises serum leptin level, which has been demonstrated to suppress ovarian activities thus causing delayed ovulation in S. heathi. Circulating levels of lipids were high during winter dormancy, which may provide energy to stored sperms. The study thus suggests that the unique reproductive features of female vespertilionid bat are strongly linked to fat deposition. J. Exp. Zool. 309A:94–110, 2008.",
