            "abstractNote": "Many species of human pathogenic fungi secrete proteases in vitro or during the infection process. Secreted endoproteases belong to the aspartic proteases of the pepsin family, serine proteases of the subtilisin family, and metalloproteases of two different families. To these proteases has to be added the non-pepsin-type aspartic protease from Aspergillus niger and a unique chymotrypsin-like protease from Coccidioides immitis. Pathogenic fungi also secrete aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases and dipeptidyl-peptidases. The function of fungal secreted proteases and their importance in infections vary. It is evident that secreted proteases are important for the virulence of dermatophytes since these fungi grow exclusively in the stratum corneum, nails or hair, which constitutes their sole nitrogen and carbon sources. The aspartic proteases secreted by Candida albicans are involved in the adherence process and penetration of tissues, and in interactions with the immune system of the infected host. For Aspergillus fumigatus, the role of proteolytic activity has not yet been proved. Although the secreted proteases have been intensively investigated as potential virulence factors, knowledge on protease substrate specificities is rather poor and few studies have focused on the research of inhibitors. Knowledge of substrate specificities will increase our understanding about the action of each protease secreted by pathogenic fungi and will help to determine their contribution to virulence.",

            "abstractNote": "Hibernation is a seasonally entrained and profound phenotypic transition to conserve energy in winter. It involves significant biochemical reprogramming, although our understanding of the underpinning molecular events is fragmentary and selective. We have conducted a large-scale gene expression screen of the golden-mantled ground squirrel, Spermophilus lateralis, to identify transcriptional responses associated specifically with the summer-winter transition and the torpid-arousal transition in winter. We used 112 cDNA microarrays comprising 12,288 probes that cover at least 5,109 genes. In liver, the profiles of torpid and active states in the winter were almost identical, although we identified 102 cDNAs that were differentially expressed between winter and summer, 90% of which were downregulated in the winter states. By contrast, in cardiac tissue, 59 and 115 cDNAs were elevated in interbout arousal and torpor, respectively, relative to the summer active condition, but only 7 were common to both winter states, and during arousal none was downregulated. In brain, 78 cDNAs were found to change in winter, 44 of which were upregulated. Thus transcriptional changes associated with hibernation are qualitatively modest and, since these changes are generally less than twofold, also quantitatively modest. Unbiased Gene Ontology profiling of the transcripts suggests a winter switch to beta-oxidation of lipids in liver and heart, a reduction in metabolism of toxic compounds and the urea cycle in liver, and downregulated electron transport in the brain. We identified just one strongly winter-induced transcript common to all tissues, namely an RNA-binding protein, RBM3. This analysis clearly differentiates responses of the principal tissues, identifies a large number of new genes undergoing regulation, and broadens our understanding of affected cellular processes that, in part, account for the winter-adaptive hibernating phenotype.",

            "abstractNote": "The Gambian epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus gambianus) is very common across a variety of West African habitats, but very little information is available on its feeding ecology or its contribution to ecosystem function. We investigated seasonal variation in food availability and the relative importance of dietary items used by this species in a forest-savannah transitional ecosystem. Dietary items were identified from 1,470 samples of fecal and ejecta pellets which had been collected under day roosts or from captured bats over a 2-year period (2014–2015). Plant phenology studies illustrated strong seasonal correlations between fruiting and flowering and rainfall patterns: Fruits were available throughout the year but with peaks of abundance during the rainy season, while flowers were mostly abundant during the dry season. Epomophorus gambianus bats utilized fruit and flower resources from 30 plant species. Although the plant species used depended on seasonal availability, there were clear preferences for certain species. Flowers were an important food source for this fruit bat species especially during the dry season, contributing up to 79% of dietary items when fruit abundance was low. Ficus fruits were also important food item for E. gambianus, constituting over 40% of all dietary samples identified. Policy implications. Our results show the importance of flowers in the diet of E. gambianus and highlight this species as an important pollinator and seed disperser, including for economically and ecologically important plant species. These findings contribute to an improved understanding of the ecological importance and potential role of this species in the forest-savannah transition ecosystem for the development of fruit bat conservation management strategies.",

            "abstractNote": "The African yellow-winged bat (Lavia frons) was observed in Kenya, East Africa, through one wet and one dry season (December 1982 to July 1983). This opportunistic, sit-and-wait predator typically forages from the crowns of Acacia tortilis and captures insects through a broad range of elevations by brief, precise interceptions. Lavia is monogamous. Members of a pair roost together in a territory defended by the male, forage either separately or together, and share the territory for some 3 months with the single young. Acacia tortilis responds to erratic dry-season rains by flowering and growing new leaves; attending brief bursts of insect abundance may be of crucial importance to Lavia during dry-season energy bottlenecks. Many of the most distinctive aspects of the life history of Lavia-monogamy, territoriality, the division of labor, opportunistic foraging, a long mother-young association, and a close association between Lavia and A. tortilis-probably are adaptations to recurring periods of energy stress.",

            "abstractNote": "Animals that spend more energy than they obtain risk entering allostatic overload, reducing survival and fitness. They are predicted to adjust their daily energy expenditure (DEE) during periods of food scarcity. Adjustments of DEE to changes in food availability have been well-studied in species in temperate zones during winter, but less so in species enduring seasonal droughts. Likely mechanisms regulating DEE involve adjustments of activity and maintenance metabolism. Species that experience seasonal droughts and changes in food availability, like the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), are appropriate model organisms to study the regulation of seasonal changes of DEE. We quantified DEE using the ‘doubly labelled water’ method, measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), and concomitantly determined activity levels using all-day focal observations of 69 free-living striped mice in the cold moist season with high food availability and the hot dry season with low food availability. Striped mice decreased their DEE in the food scarce dry season using multiple mechanisms, especially reductions in RMR, and reduced overall physical activity. This was further facilitated passively by reduced thermoregulatory costs. Our study demonstrates that animals reduce DEE via active and passive mechanisms in food-restricted environments, and highlights that several environmental factors should be considered simultaneously when aiming to understand how animals cope with harsh environments.",

We expanded these findings by assessing the viral dynamics in a southern African bat population. A longitudinal study of henipavirus diversity and excretion dynamics identified 18 putative viral species circulating in a local population, three with differing seasonal dynamics, and the winter and spring periods posing a higher risk of virus spillover and transmission. The annual peaks in virus excretion are most likely driven by subadults and may be linked to the waning of maternal immunity and recolonization of the roost in early spring. These results provide insightful information into the bat-host relationship that can be extrapolated to other populations across Africa and be communicated to at-risk communities as a part of evidence-based public health education and prevention measures against pathogen spillover threats.",

            "abstractNote": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are considered a major threat to global health. Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans.",

Previous studies indicated that GPR41 and GPR43 are involved in the secretion of gastrointestinal peptides, and glucose and lipid metabolism, and are closely related to obesity and type II diabetes, and other diseases. The purpose of the study was to explore the relationship of the GPR41 and GPR43 with seasonal breeding, and provide new prospects for further exploring the nutritional needs of breeding. We identified the localization and expression levels of GPR41 and GPR43 in the colon of the wild ground squirrels (Spermophilus dauricus) both in the breeding season and non-breeding season. The histological results revealed that the lumen diameter of the colon had obvious seasonal changes, and the diameter of the colonic lumen in the non-breeding season was larger than that in the breeding season. Immunohistochemical staining suggested that GPR41 and GPR43 are expressed in the simple layer columnar epithelium. In addition, compared with the breeding season, the mRNA and protein expression levels of GPR41 and GPR43 in the colon were higher during the non-breeding season. In general, these results indicated that GPR41 and GPR43 might play a certain role in regulating seasonal breeding.",

Animals monitor day length (photoperiod) to engage seasonally appropriate adaptations in anticipation of harsh winter conditions. I propose that photoperiodic information, mediated by melatonin, might also influence immune responses. Individuals could improve survival if seasonally recurring stressors were anticipated and countered. Recent studies suggest that short day lengths reroute energy from reproduction and growth to bolster immune function during winter. Short days can either enhance or suppress components of immune function, as well as reduce fever and the expression of sickness behaviors. The net result of these photoperiod-mediated adjustments is enhanced immune function and increased survival. Melatonin appears to be part of an integrated system that coordinates reproductive, immunological and other processes to cope successfully with energetic stressors during winter and to balance trade-offs between reproductive success and survival.",

Thus, to survive and reproduce successfully, these organisms must allocate resources among competing physiological systems in such a way as to maximize fitness in changing environments. Here, we review evidence supporting the hypothesis that physiological trade-offs, particularly those between the reproductive and immune systems, mediate part of the seasonal changes detected in the immune defences of many vertebrates. Abundant recent work has detected significant energetic and nutritional costs of immune defence. Sometimes these physiological costs are sufficiently large to affect fitness (e.g. reproductive output, growth or survival), indicating that selection for appropriate allocation strategies probably occurred in the past. Because hormones often orchestrate allocations among physiological systems, the endocrine mediators of seasonal changes in immune activity are discussed. Many hormones, including melatonin, glucocorticoids and androgens have extensive and consistent effects on the immune system, and they change in systematic fashions over the year. Finally, a modified framework within which to conduct future studies in ecological immunology is proposed, viz. a heightened appreciation of the complex but intelligible nature of the vertebrate immune system. Although other factors besides trade-offs undoubtedly influence seasonal variation in immune defence in animals, a growing literature supports a role for physiological trade-offs and the fitness consequences they sometimes produce.",

We examined several aspects of the intestinal immune system in summer (non-hibernating) and hibernating ground squirrels. Peyer's patches were largely unaffected by hibernation, but numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and lamina propria leukocytes (LPL) were greater in hibernators compared with summer. Hibernator IEL were less mature as demonstrated by low numbers of cells expressing activation-associated markers and co-receptors. Compared with summer, the percentage of B cells was higher and percentage of T cells was lower in the hibernator LPL. Hibernation was associated with greater mucosal levels of IFN-??, TNF-??, IL-10 and IL-4, but IL-6 and TGF-?? were unchanged. Mucosal IgA levels were greater in entrance and torpid hibernators compared with summer. The results suggest that modifications of the intestinal immune system during hibernation may help preserve gut integrity throughout the winter fast. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "Mammalian hibernation presents a unique opportunity to study naturally occurring neuroprotection. Hibernating ground squirrels undergo rapid and extreme physiological changes in body temperature, oxygen consumption, and heart rate without suffering neurological damage from ischemia and reperfusion injury. Different brain regions show markedly different activity during the torpor/arousal cycle: the cerebral cortex shows activity only during the periodic returns to normothermia, while the hypothalamus is active over the entire temperature range. Therefore, region-specific neuroprotective strategies must exist to permit this compartmentalized spectrum of activity. In this study, we use the Illumina HiSeq platform to compare the transcriptomes of these two brain regions at four collection points across the hibernation season: April Active, October Active, Torpor, and IBA. In the cerebral cortex, 1,085 genes were found to be differentially expressed across collection points, while 1,063 genes were differentially expressed in the hypothalamus. Comparison of these transcripts indicates that the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus implement very different strategies during hibernation, showing less than 20% of these differentially expressed genes in common. The cerebral cortex transcriptome shows evidence of remodeling and plasticity during hibernation, including transcripts for the presynaptic cytomatrix proteins bassoon and piccolo, and extracellular matrix components, including laminins and collagens. Conversely, the hypothalamic transcriptome displays upregulation of transcripts involved in damage response signaling and protein turnover during hibernation, including the DNA damage repair gene RAD50 and ubiquitin E3 ligases UBR1 and UBR5. Additionally, the hypothalamus transcriptome also provides evidence of potential mechanisms underlying the hibernation phenotype, including feeding and satiety signaling, seasonal timing mechanisms, and fuel utilization. This study provides insight into potential neuroprotective strategies and hibernation control mechanisms, and also specifically shows that the hibernator brain exhibits both seasonal and regional differences in mRNA expression.",

            "abstractNote": "Endothermic mammals and birds require intensive energy turnover to sustain high body temperatures and metabolic rates. To cope with the energetic bottlenecks associated with the change of seasons, and to minimise energy expenditure, complex mechanisms and strategies are used, such as daily torpor and hibernation. During torpor, metabolic depression and low body temperatures save energy. However, these bouts of torpor, lasting for hours to weeks, are interrupted by active ‘euthermic’ phases with high body temperatures. These dynamic transitions require precise communication between the brain and peripheral tissues to defend rheostasis in energetics, body mass and body temperature. The hypothalamus appears to be the major control centre in the brain, coordinating energy metabolism and body temperature. The sympathetic nervous system controls body temperature by adjustments of shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis, with the latter being primarily executed by brown adipose tissue. Over the last decade, comparative physiologists have put forward integrative studies on the ecophysiology, biochemistry and molecular regulation of energy balance in response to seasonal challenges, food availability and ambient temperature. Mammals coping with such environments comprise excellent model organisms for studying the dynamic regulation of energy metabolism. Beyond the understanding of how animals survive in nature, these studies also uncover general mechanisms of mammalian energy homeostasis. This research will benefit efforts of translational medicine aiming to combat emerging human metabolic disorders. The present review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of energy balance and its neuronal and endocrine control during the most extreme metabolic fluctuations in nature: daily torpor and hibernation.",

            "abstractNote": "Winter is energetically demanding. Physiological and behavior adaptations have evolved among nontropical animals to cope with winter because thermoregulatory demands increase when food availability decreases. Seasonal breeding is central within the suite of winter adaptations among small animals. Presumably, reproductive inhibition during winter conserves energy at a time when the odds of producing viable young are low. In addition to the well-studied seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many populations of mammals and birds in the field. Challenging winter conditions, such as low ambient temperatures and decreased food availability, can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation, or shock. In some cases, survival in demanding winter conditions puts individuals under great physiological stress, defined here as an adaptive process that results in elevated blood levels of glucocorticoids. The stress of coping with energetically demanding conditions can also indirectly cause illness and death by compromising immune function. Presumably, the increased blood concentrations of adrenocortical steroids in response to winter stressors compromise immune function and accelerate catabolic mechanisms in the field, although the physiological effects of elevated glucocorticoids induced by artificial stressors have been investigated primarily in the laboratory. However, recurrent environmental stressors could reduce survival if they evoke persistent glucocorticoid secretion. The working hypothesis of this article is that mechanisms have evolved in some animals to cambat seasonal stress-induced immunocompromise as a temporal adaptation to promote survival. Furthermore, we hypothesize that mechanisms have evolved that allow individuals to anticipate periods of immunologically challenging conditions, and to cope with these seasonal health-threatening conditions. The primary environmental cue that permits physiological anticipation of season is the daily photoperiod; however, other environmental factors may interact with photoperiod to affect immune function and disease processes. The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in lymphatic organ size, structure, immune function, and disease processes, and their possible interactions with recurrent environmental stressor, is reviewed. Seasonal peaks of lymphatic organ size and structure generally occur in late autumn or early winter and seasonal minima are oberved prior to the onset of breeding. Although many of the field data suggest that immune function and disease processes are also enhanced during the winter, the opposite seasonal pattern is also observed in some studies. We propose that compromised immune function may be observed in some populations during particularly harsh winters when stressors override the enhancement of immune function evoked by short day lenghts. Because so many factors covary in field studies, assessment of our proposal that photoperiod mediates seasonal changes in immune function requires laboratory studies in which only photoperiod is varied. A review of the effects of photoperiod on immune function in laboratory studies reveals that exposure to short day lengths enhances immune function in every species examined. Short day exposure in small mammals causes reproductive inhibition and concomitant reduction in plasma levels of prolactin and steroid hormones, as well as alterations in the temporal pattern of pineal melatonin secretion. These hormones effect immune function, and influence the development of opportunistic disease, including cancer; however, it appears that either prolactin or melatonin secretion is responsible for mediating the effects of photoperiod on immune function. Taken together, day length appears to affect immune function in many species, including animals that typically do not exhibit reproductive responsiveness to day length. These data could have a major impact on understanding the etiology and progression of diseases in humans and nonhuman animals. The clinical significance of these data is also considered.",

Seasonal changes in hormone activity affect metabolism, body temperature, and reproductive activity. We examined the seasonal regulatory role of hormones on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and regulatory nonshivering thermogenesis (RNST) in 98 female and 17 male adult Eptesicus fuscus (big brown bat). We measured BMR, RNST, and plasma levels of thyroid hormone (T3), leptin, and cortisol in bats captured in maternity colonies in eastern Massachusetts from May to August (from arousal from the hibernation phase to the prehibernation phase). We hypothesized that all three hormones are seasonally primarily metabolic hormones and secondarily thermogenic hormones. In males, only BMR significantly changed seasonally. In females, all five variables significantly changed seasonally. The seasonal pattern of plasma leptin and cortisol levels correlated with the seasonal pattern of BMR, with an initial increase followed by a decrease, suggesting that leptin and cortisol are primarily metabolic hormones. The seasonal pattern of plasma T3 levels generally paralleled the basic seasonal pattern of RNST, with both increasing at the second half of the season, suggesting that T3 is primarily a thermogenic hormone. The observed decrease in plasma leptin levels may be necessary to allow for the observed seasonal decrease in BMR, with the similar cortisol pattern important for leptin regulation. While T3 is needed to maintain BMR, it may play a more critical role in the seasonal regulation of RNST than of BMR.",

            "abstractNote": "The flight membranes of bats serve a number of physiological functions important for survival. Although flight membrane injuries are commonly observed in wild-caught bats, in most cases the damage heals completely. Previous studies examining wound healing in the flight membranes of bats have not taken into consideration energy constraints that could influence healing times. Wound healing results in increased energy demands, therefore we hypothesized that wound healing times would be slower during periods of energy conservation and/or energy output. In this study we used an 8 mm diameter circular punch tool to biopsy the wing membranes of healthy adult female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) from a captive research colony to test the hypothesis that healing times will vary with seasonal temperature changes between the summer and winter seasons, and with reproductive condition between lactating and non-reproductive females. As expected, membrane biopsies took significantly longer to heal during the winter when bats were hibernating compared to the summer when bats were active. Surprisingly, no difference in healing time was observed between lactating and non-reproductive females. The wings of most bats fully healed, although some individuals showed wound expansion demonstrating that impaired healing is occasionally observed in otherwise healthy subjects.",

            "abstractNote": "The natural ecology of Ebola virus infection remains enigmatic. No clear reservoir species has been confirmed but there is evidence of infection in a wide spectrum of mammals, including humans, non-human primates, domestic and wild ungulates and a variety of bat species, both frugivorous and insectivorous. Humans and most other species examined appear to be spillover hosts and suffer disease. Bats are the exception and are tolerant to infection in some laboratory studies. Some surveys show a low prevalence of antibodies against Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) strains in bats during human outbreaks and inter-epidemic periods, and this order of mammals is considered to be the likely reservoir for the virus. Other putative sources include insects but this hypothesis is unproven in the field or laboratory. Moreover, some potential sources, such as aquatic species, have yet to be investigated. There are a number of environmental, human behavioural and ecological risk factors proposed with respect to spillover and spread. In the West African outbreak, which was unprecedented in scale and geographic spread, the source of the spillover remains unproven, although an association exists between the proposed index case and a colony of insectivorous bats. In all but a few Ebola virus disease events, spillover has only been superficially investigated and this was also the case in the West African epidemic. The authors suggest that, to address risks at the human-animal-environmental interface, using a One Health approach, more effort is needed to investigate spillover factors at the time of a ZEBOV epidemic, in addition to conducting inter-epidemic surveys in peridomestic environments. The true prevalence of ZEBOV infection in any species of bats remains unknown. Large-scale, expensive, non-randomised surveys, with low sampling numbers per species, are unlikely to provide evidence for Ebola virus reservoirs or to improve our epidemiological understanding.",

            "abstractNote": "Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) belong to a genetically and antigenically diverse class of retroviruses that naturally infect a wide range of nonhuman primates (NHPs) and can also be transmitted to humans occupationally exposed to NHPs. Current serologic detection of SFV infection requires separate Western blot (WB) testing by using two different SFV antigens [SFV(AGM) (African green monkey) and SFV(CPZ) (chimpanzee)]. However, this method is labor intensive and validation is limited to only small numbers of NHPs. To facilitate serologic SFV testing, we developed a WB assay that combines antigens from both SFV(AGM) and SFV(CPZ). The combined-antigen WB (CA-WB) assay was validated with 145 serum samples from 129 NHPs (32 African and Asian species) and 16 humans, all with known SFV infection status determined by PCR. Concordant CA-WB results were obtained for all 145 PCR-positive or -negative primate and human specimens, giving the assay a 100% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, no reactivity was observed in sera from persons positive for human immunodeficiency virus or human T cell lymphotropic virus (HIV/HTLV) (n = 25) or HIV/HTLV-negative U.S. blood donors (n = 100). Using the CA-WB assay, we screened 360 sera from 43 Old World primate species and found an SFV prevalence of about 68% in both African and Asian primates. We also isolated SFV from the blood of four seropositive primates (Allenopithecus nigroviridis, Trachypithecus francoisi, Hylobates pileatus, and H. leucogenys) not previously known to be infected with SFV. Phylogenetic analysis of integrase sequences from these isolates confirmed that all four SFVs represent new, distinct, and highly divergent lineages. These results demonstrate the ability of the CA-WB assay to detect infection in a large number of NHP species, including previously uncharacterized infections with divergent SFVs.",

            "abstractNote": "Antibody titers against a viral pathogen are typically measured using an antigen binding assay, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which only measures the ability of antibodies to identify a viral antigen of interest. Neutralization assays measure the presence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in a sample. Traditional neutralization assays, such as the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), are often difficult to use on a large scale due to being both labor and resource intensive. Here we describe an Ebola virus fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA), which tests for neutralizing antibodies, that requires only a small volume of sample in a 96-well format and is easy to automate. The readout of the FRNA is the percentage of Ebola virus-infected cells measured with an optical reader or overall chemiluminescence that can be generated by multiple reading platforms. Using blinded human clinical samples (EVD survivors or contacts) obtained in Liberia during the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak, we demonstrate there was a high degree of agreement between the FRNA-measured antibody titers and the Filovirus Animal Non-clinical Group (FANG) ELISA titers with the FRNA providing information on the neutralizing capabilities of the antibodies.",

            "abstractNote": "The COVID‐19 pandemic has caused huge loss of life, and immense social and economic harm. Wildlife trade has become central to discourse on COVID-19, zoonotic pandemics, and related policy responses, which must focus on “saving lives, protecting livelihoods, and safeguarding nature”. Proposed policy responses have included extreme measures such as banning all use and trade of wildlife, or blanket measures for entire Classes. However, different trades pose varying degrees of risk for zoonotic pandemics, while some trades also play critical roles in delivering other key aspects of sustainable development, particularly related to poverty and hunger alleviation, decent work, responsible consumption and production, and life on land and below water. Here we describe how wildlife trade contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in diverse ways, with synergies and trade-offs within and between the SDGs. In doing so, we show that prohibitions could result in severe trade-offs against some SDGs, with limited benefits for public health via pandemic prevention. This complexity necessitates context-specific policies, with multi-sector decision-making that goes beyond simple top-down solutions. We encourage decision-makers to adopt a risk-based approach to wildlife trade policy post-COVID-19, with policies formulated via participatory, evidence-based approaches, which explicitly acknowledge uncertainty, complexity, and conflicting values across different components of the SDGs. This should help to ensure that future use and trade of wildlife is safe, environmentally-sustainable and socially-just.",

            "abstractNote": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the recent COVID-19 public health crisis. Bat is the widely believed original host of SARS-CoV-2. However, its intermediate host before transmitting to humans is not clear. Some studies proposed pangolin, snake, or turtle as the intermediate hosts. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which determines the potential host range for SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of structural information of the complex of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), we analyzed the affinity to S protein of the 20 key residues in ACE2 from mammal, bird, turtle, and snake. Several ACE2 proteins from Primates, Bovidae, Cricetidae, and Cetacea maintained the majority of key residues in ACE2 for associating with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The simulated structures indicated that ACE2 proteins from Bovidae and Cricetidae were able to associate with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that nearly half of the key residues in turtle, snake, and bird were changed. The simulated structures showed several key contacts with SARS-CoV-2 RBD in turtle and snake ACE2 were abolished. This study demonstrated that neither snake nor turtle was the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, which further reinforced the concept that the reptiles are resistant against infection of coronavirus. This study suggested that Bovidae and Cricetidae should be included in the screening of intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.",

However, clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs), enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by confocal and electron microscopy. Enterocytes produced infectious viral particles, whereas messenger RNA expression analysis of hSIOs revealed induction of a generic viral response program. Therefore, the intestinal epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, and hSIOs serve as an experimental model for coronavirus infection and biology.",

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist, suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays revealed that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene products with strong anti-interferon activity. Furthermore, analyses of more than 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified a natural variant, in which a longer ORF3b reading frame was reconstituted. This variant was isolated from two patients with severe disease and further increased the ability of ORF3b to suppress interferon induction. Thus, our findings not only help to explain the poor interferon response in COVID-19 patients, but also describe a possibility of the emergence of natural SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with extended ORF3b that may exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms.</p>",

Here, we evaluate transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor driven by the cytokeratin-18 (K18) gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lungs, with spread to other organs. A decline in pulmonary function occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils and activated T cells. SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with signatures of nuclear factor-κB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection shares many features of severe COVID-19 infection and can be used to define the basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.",

This viral infection causes a series of respiratory disorders, and although this virus mainly infects respiratory cells, the small intestine can also be an important site of entry or interaction, as enterocytes highly express in angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (ACE) receptors. There are countless reports pointing to the importance of interferons (IFNs) with regard to the mediation of the immune system in viral infection by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this review will focus on the main cells that make up the large intestine, their specific immunology, as well as the function of IFNs in the intestinal mucosa after the invasion of coronavirus-2.",

            "abstractNote": "COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness, but several clinical reports have described gastrointestinal symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can replicate within the stomach. Here we generate gastric organoids from fetal, pediatric, and adult biopsies as in vitro models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To facilitate infection, we induce reverse polarity in the gastric organoids. We find that the pediatric and late fetal gastric organoids are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, while viral replication is significantly lower in undifferentiated organoids of early fetal and adult origin. We demonstrate that adult gastric organoids are more susceptible to infection following differentiation. We perform transcriptomic analysis to reveal a moderate innate antiviral response and a lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we show that the virus can efficiently infect the gastric epithelium, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",

We compared infection of ex vivo human intestinal tissues by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with respect to their replication kinetics and immune activation profile.\nMethods\nHuman intestinal tissues were obtained from patients while undergoing surgical operations at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Upon surgical removal, the tissues were immediately processed and infected with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV. Replication kinetics were determined with immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and plaque assays. Immune activation in the infected intestinal tissues was assessed by detecting the gene expression of interferons and representative pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.\nResults\nSARS-CoV-2 could infect and productively replicate in the ex vivo human intestinal tissues with release of infectious virus particles, but not in ex vivo human liver and kidney tissues. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 replicated less efficiently than SARS-CoV, induced less cytopathology in the human intestinal epithelium, and induced a more robust innate immune response including the activation of both type I and type III interferons, than SARS-CoV in human intestinal tissues.\nConclusion\nUsing the ex vivo human intestinal tissues as a physiologically relevant model, our data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could productively replicate in the human gut and suggested that the gastrointestinal tract might serve as an alternative route of virus dissemination. SARS-CoV-2 replicated less efficiently and induced less cytopathology than SARS-CoV in keeping with the clinical observations reported for COVID-19 and SARS, which might be the result of a more robust immune activation by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV in the human intestine.",

It was caused by a novel animal coronavirus, never recognized or characterized before. This SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) exploited opportunities provided by 'wet markets' in southern China to adapt to the palm civet and human. Under the positive selection pressure of human host, certain mutated lineages of the virus became readily transmissible between humans and thus caused the epidemic of 2002-2003. This review will provide first-hand information, particularly from Guangdong, China, about the initial epidemiology, the identification of the aetiological agent of the disease, the molecular evolution study of the virus, the finding of SARS-like CoV in horseshoe bats and the mechanistic analysis for the cross-host tropism transition. The substantial scientific contributions made by the Chinese scientists towards understanding the virus and the disease will be emphasized. Along with the description of the scientific discoveries and analyses, the significant impact of these researches upon the public health measurement or regulations will be highlighted. It is aimed to appreciate the concerted and coordinated global response that controlled SARS within a short period of time as well as the research strategy and methodology developed along with this process, which can be applied in response to other public health challenges, particularly the future emerging/re-merging infectious diseases.",

This formula should be useful in designing clinical trials with a heterogeneous patient population.

That result is extended to the case where concomitant information is available for each individual and where the proportional-hazards model holds. The loss of efficiency caused by ignoring concomitant variables is also computed.",

Anthropogenic activities in shared environments may promote transmission of zoonotic pathogens between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Between July 2012 and February 2014, we evaluated Salmonella prevalence, serovars, genotypes, and antibiotic resistant phenotypes in resident and migratory birds utilizing human-impacted habitats in northwestern Lake Victoria and protected habitats in Queen Elisabeth National Park. Salmonella occurrence in the urban environment was assessed by sampling storm-water and wastewater from a channel that drains Kampala City into Lake Victoria. Salmonella was detected in 4.3% pooled bird fecal samples, and 57.1% of environmental samples. While birds in impacted and protected areas shared serovars, the genotypes were distinct. We found distinct strains in birds and the environment suggesting some strains in birds are host adapted, and strains circulating in the environment may not necessarily disseminate to birds. Conversely, birds in both impacted and protected areas shared strains with the urban environment, suggesting Salmonella disseminates between impacted environments and birds across sites. Overall, more strains were observed in the urban environment compared to birds, and poses risk of Salmonella reemergence in birds and transmission across species and space.",

Accurate computational methods for the quantification of transcript abundances are essential for downstream analysis. However, most existing approaches are much slower than is necessary for their degree of accuracy. We introduce Salmon, a novel method and software tool for transcript quantification that exhibits state-of-the-art accuracy while being significantly faster than most other tools. Salmon achieves this through the combined application of a two-phase inference procedure, a reduced data representation, and a novel lightweight read alignment algorithm. Salmon is written in C++11, and is available under the GPL v3 license as open-source software at https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon.",

To test the hypothesis that the efficacy of HKY- induced protection may be due to the cross-reactive antigens in the cell walls of the different fungi, we studied the effect of HKY against systemic candidiasis. Male CD-1 mice were given different regimens of HKY subcutaneously prior to intravenous challenge with Candida albicans. Compared to PBS controls, the administration of HKY (6 × 10(7)) 3, 4 or 6 times prolonged survival (all P < 0.05) and reduced fungal load in the kidney (all P < 0.05). An HKY dose of 1.2 × 10(8) given 4 times prolonged survival (P = 0.02), but showed dose-limiting toxicity. HKY given by an oral route, or by a subcutaneous route with alum as an adjuvant, did not improve survival. Overall, we found that HKY protects mice from infection by Candida albicans in a dose-and regimen-dependent manner. To understand the protection induced by HKY against different fungal species, additional studies of epitope mapping are warranted.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.\\n\\nRESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.",

At these \"decision nodes\" various cytokines direct alloresponsive T cells to develop either a proinflammatory response aimed at graft destruction or an immunoregulatory response facilitating graft acceptance. This review will focus on the role of these cytokines in influencing the progression of an alloimmune response leading ultimately to either allograft survival or rejection.",
