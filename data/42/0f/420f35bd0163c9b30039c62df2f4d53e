            "abstractNote": "Intraspecific phylogenies can provide useful insights into how populations have been shaped by historical and contemporary processes. Taiwan formed around 5 million years ago from tectonic uplift, and has been connected to mainland Asia several times since its emergence. A central mountain range runs north to south, bisecting the island, and potentially impedes gene flow along an east–west axis. The Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros) is endemic to Taiwan, where it is found mainly at low altitude. To determine the population structure and the demographic and colonization history of this species, we examined variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region in 203 bats sampled at 26 sites. We found very high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, which decreased from the centre to the south and north. Population differentiation followed a pattern of isolation by distance, though most regional genetic variance was attributable to differences between the relatively isolated southern population and those from other regions. A haplotype network was consistent with these findings and also suggested a southward colonization, followed by subsequent secondary contact between the south and other regions. Mismatch distributions were used to infer a past population expansion predating the last glacial maximum, and a neighbour-joining tree showed that R. monoceros formed a monophyletic grouping with respect to its sister taxa. Taken together, our results suggest that this taxon arose from a single period of colonization, and that demographic growth followed in the late Pleistocene. Current genetic structure reflects limited gene flow, probably coupled with stepwise colonization in the past. We consider explanations for the persistence of the species through multiple glacial maxima.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Insectivorous bats are particularly susceptible to heat loss due to their relatively large surface area to volume ratio. Therefore, to maintain a high normothermic body temperature, bats require large amounts of energy for thermoregulation. This can be energetically challenging for small bats during cold periods as heat loss is augmented and insect prey is reduced. To conserve energy many bats enter a state of torpor characterized by a controlled reduction of metabolism and body temperature in combination with selecting roosts based upon thermal properties. Our study aimed to quantify torpor patterns and roost preferences of free-ranging little forest bats (Vespadelus vulturnus) during winter to identify physiological and behavioral mechanisms used by this species for survival of the cold season. All bats captured were male (body mass 4.9 ± 0.7 g, n = 6) and used torpor on every day monitored, with bouts lasting up to 187.58 h (mean = 35.5 ± 36.7 h, n = 6, total number of samples [N] = 61). Torpor bout duration was significantly correlated with daily minimum and maximum ambient temperature, mean skin temperature, insect mass, and body mass of individuals and the multiday torpor bouts recorded in the cold qualify as hibernation. The lowest skin temperature recorded was 5.2°C, which corresponded to the lowest ambient temperature measurement of −5.8°C. Most bats chose tall, large, live Eucalyptus trees for roosting and to leave their roost for foraging on warmer days. Many individuals often switched roosts (every 3–5 days) and movements increased as spring approached (every 1–2 days). Our data suggest that V. vulturnus are capable of using the environmental temperature to gauge potential foraging opportunities and as a cue to reenter torpor when conditions are unsuitable. Importantly, frequent use of torpor and appropriate roost selection form key roles in the winter survival of these tiny bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats can be phylogenetically classified into three major groups: pteropodids, rhinolophoids, and yangochiropterans. While rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans are capable of laryngeal echolocation, pteropodids lack this ability. Delicate ear movements are essential for echolocation behavior in bats with laryngeal echolocation. Caudal auricular muscles, especially the cervicoauricularis group, play a critical role in such ear movements. Previously, caudal auricular muscles were studied in three species of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but to our knowledge, there have been no studies on non-laryngeal echolocators, the pteropodids. Here, we describe the gross anatomy of the cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation in Cynopterus sphinx by using diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography and 3D reconstructions of immunohistochemically stained serial sections. A previous study on bats with laryngeal echolocation reported that rhinolophoids have four cervicoauricularis muscles and yangochiropterans have three. We observed three cervicoauricularis muscles in the pteropodid C. sphinx. The number of cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation pattern were comparable to those of non-bat boreoeutherian mammals and yangochiropterans, suggesting that pteropodids, and yangochiropterans maintain the general condition of boreoeutherian mammals and that rhinolophoids have a derived condition. The unique nomenclature had been previously applied to the cervicoauricularis muscles of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but given the commonality between non-bat laurasiatherians and bats, with the exception of rhinolophoids, maintaining the conventional nomenclature (i.e., M. cervicoauricularis superficialis, M. cervicoauricularis medius, and M. cervicoauricularis profundus) is proposed for bats.",

To investigate the molecular link between circadian and hibernating rhythms in the greater tube-nosed bats, Murina leucogaster, we set out to identify circadian genes that are expressed in bats, with specific focus on the PAS domain by using PCR-based screens. We could isolate a cDNA clone, designated as LPAS1, that encodes a protein of 521 amino acid residues. LPAS1 is closely related with CLOCK family with the highest homology to human CLOCK. Based on RT-PCR analyses, LPAS1 transcripts are ubiquitously present in tissues from both summer active and winter dormant periods. Given that LPAS1 is a member of the bHLH-PAS protein superfamily but lacks polyglutamine transactivation domains, it is likely to function as a repressor for endogenous CLOCK to hinder its roles in promoting transcription. Our result will open a new avenue to further examine the functional interconnection between the circadian clock and the circannual clock such as mammalian hibernation.",

In particular, we describe steps which enable laboratories that do not have access to live bats to perform extended experimental work upon procuring an initial batch of bat primary airway tissue. Complete mucociliary diﬀerentiation required treatment with IL-13. E. spelaea ALI-AECs supported productive infection with PRV3M, an orthoreovirus for which Pteropodid bats are considered the reservoir species. However, these ALI-AECs did not support SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite E. spelaea ACE2 receptor being capable of mediating SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus entry.

In this study, we investigated the nuclear and mitochondrial genetic differentiation of the long fingered bat,\n              Myotis capaccinii\n              during the ice ages in south‐eastern Europe and Anatolia. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses indicated a suture zone similar to those recorded in other animal species, including bats, suggesting the association of more than one refugium with the region. Contrary to most of the other species where a suture zone was seen in Anatolia, for\n              M. capaccinii\n              the geographical location of the genetic break was in south‐eastern Europe. This mitochondrial differentiation was not reflected in the nuclear microsatellites, however, suggesting that the lack of contact during the ice ages did not result in reproductive isolation. Hence taxonomically, the two mitochondrial clades cannot be treated as separate species.",

Despite the great morphological diversity in Chiroptera, the hindlimbs morphology and its postnatal development have been poorly studied. Postnatal development of hindlimbs in Noctilio leporinus is described, further comparing the morphology of adults with that of Noctilio albiventris and previously reported species (Desmodus rotundus, Artibeus lituratus, Molossus molossus). The ossification ending sequence at autopodium elements of N. leporinus does not follow the distal to proximal directional sequence described for D. rotundus, exhibiting a heterochronic delayed ossification ending for the digits of N. leporinus regarding other hindlimb elements, associated with the bigger relative autopodium size of this fisher bat regarding other bat species. Noctilionid bats share the same adult hindlimb bone morphology, except for differences at hindlimb proportions and calcar ossification degree. There are differences in the number and position of bony processes, slots and sesamoids of adult noctilionid fisher bats regarding previously reported species; most differences are concentrated at the autopodium and are related to an increased surface for muscular insertion and the structural support of claws. These facts seem to be closely associated with functional demands of the feeding strategy of noctilionid fisher bats.",

Cystidicola cristivomeri White, 1941 is considered a synonym of C. stigmatura. Cystidicola stigmatura is distinguished from the only other species in the genus, namely C. farionis Fischer, 1798, by the presence of lateral lobes on the eggs rather than filaments. A neotype of F. stigmatura is designated. Cystidicola stigmatura has not been found in fishes in the Great Lakes since 1925. The parasite was found in museum specimens of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) collected before 1925, suggesting that the species became rare or disappeared with the decline of lake trout in these lakes.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n          Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot that is facing rapid rates of deforestation, habitat destruction and poverty. Urgent action is required to document the status of biodiversity to facilitate efficacious conservation plans. Within country, new generations of Malagasy scientists and conservationists are taking on leadership roles, although many lack access to modern genetic sequencing and are underrepresented in academic publications, when compared to international counterparts.\n          \n            With the recent advent of portable and affordable genetic technologies, it is now possible to tackle logistical considerations. Mobile genetics labs, with the capacity for\n            in situ\n            DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing, can produce scientifically reproducible data under field conditions, minimizing the time between sample collection and data analysis. Additionally, mobile labs offer powerful training opportunities for in-country scientists that enable local students and researchers to actively participate and contribute fully to the research enterprise, and that further empower these communities to contribute to the conservation dialog.\n          \n          \n            Here, we show “proof of concept” by deploying a miniaturized thermal cycler alongside the Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA sequencer in Madagascar, including in the newly established Anjajavy Protected Area in northwestern Madagascar. We successfully extracted DNA from tissue samples collected using minimally-invasive techniques, amplified and sequenced a phylogenetically informative mitochondrial gene (cytochrome-b;\n            cytb\n            ), and thereby confirmed the presence of Danfoss’ mouse lemur (\n            M. danfossi\n            ) within the Anjajavy Reserve.\n          \n          \n            To demonstrate the reproducibility of our methods, we successfully performed our established molecular and analytical pipeline at two additional locations in Madagascar, where we also conducted two-day workshops at local higher-education Institutions to demonstrate the process from tissue samples to DNA sequencing. Ultimately, we show that a mobile genetics lab can provide reliable and expeditious results, become a powerful educational tool, and allow scientists to conduct genetic analyses, potentially allowing for rapid interventions under emergency conditions\n            in situ\n            .",

Illegal trade in live European eel and its products is still occurring to satisfy the high demand around the world. Law enforcement officers face the challenge of identifying both live and processed European eel in a timely fashion to detain shipments and prosecute smugglers. Here, we describe the development of a reliable, field‐based, fast, and cost‐effective real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay to detect European eels in trade. This novel assay was applied in a real law enforcement scenario, where positive results provided enough evidence to detain the shipment for more robust forensic analysis, leading to the first prosecution of eel smuggling in Hong Kong. Our approach could serve as a model for the development of other rapid and cost‐effective tools to detect illegal wildlife trade where visual identification fails to provide enough evidence for prosecution. It could also enhance monitoring and enforcement of laws intended to protect highly traded and threatened species.",

The newly recognized species is characterized by the presence of a subterminal hexagonal oral opening with 24 triangular and prominent denticles of the same shape and size and a buccal capsule with 3 oesophageal teeth with jagged edges. The male has a robust body covered with 40 to 43 pairs of subventral cuticular spines, a coiled tail with thin caudal alae, 10 pairs of papillae, and a single, precloacal, semicircular cuticular fan on the ventral surface. The first pair of precloacal papillae are composed of 2 short pedunculated papillae, a feature that seems to be unique to P. (P.) andyraicola when compared to other species of the subgenus Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines). Equal spicules and the cone-shaped gubernaculum poorly sclerotized. The female has a robust body, thinner in the anterior portion, covered by 2 rows of 67 to 80 cuticular spines, of which the first 41 to 43 pairs are anterior to the vulvar opening and symmetrically arranged, which is in contrast to the asymmetrical disposition of the postvulvar spines. This is the 15th species in the genus described from mammals in the Neotropical ecozone and the third parasitizing bats in this biogeographic region.",

            "abstractNote": "Studies on functional performance are important to understand the processes responsible for the evolution of diversity. Morphological trait variation within species inﬂuences the energetic cost of locomotion and impacts life history traits, with ecological and evolutionary consequences. This study examined wing morphology correlates of ﬂight performance measured by energetic expenditure in the Seba’s short-tailed bat, Carollia perspicillata. In the ﬂight experiments, nature caught bats (59 females, 57 males) were allowed to ﬂy for 3 min in a room. After each ﬂight, thermographic images were taken to measure body temperature, and biophysical models were used to calculate sensible heat loss as a measure of energetic expenditure. Wing morphological traits were measured for each individual and associated with heat loss and power required to ﬂy on performance surfaces. Wing morphological traits explained 7–10% of ﬂight energetic cost, and morphologies with the best performance would save the energy equivalent to 9–30% of total daily requirements. The optimal performance areas within the C. perspicillata morphospace were consistent with predicted selection trends from the literature. A trade-off between demands for ﬂight speed and maneuverability was observed. Wing loading and camber presented sexual dimorphism. These morphological differences are likely associated with more economical but less maneuverable ﬂight in females, leading them to ﬂy more often in open areas along the forest edge. Our ﬁndings demonstrate how small scale changes in wing morphology can affect life history strategies and ﬁtness.",

It has not been documented in the southeast US on bats captured outside caves or on the landscape in summer. We collected 136 skin swabs from 10 species of bats captured at 20 sites on the Tennessee side of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 12 May–16 August 2015. Three swabs were found positive for P. destructans, one from a male tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) and two from male big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). This detection of P. destructans on freeflying male bats in the southeast US during summer has potential repercussions for the spread of the fungus to novel bat species and environments. Our finding emphasizes the need to maintain rigorous year-round decontamination of field clothing and equipment until more is understood about the viability of P. destructans found on bats captured outside hibernacula during summer, about the potential for males to act as reservoirs of the fungus, and the risk of fungal transmission and spread.",

            "abstractNote": "Males of the bat Eptesicus furinalis show at least one process of testicular regression, in which the testes regress and temporarily interrupt the production of sperm, during its annual reproductive cycle. As the process of spermatogenesis is under hormonal control, mainly of pituitary and androgen hormones, our aim was to analyze the morphological variations and the hormonal control of the testes of E. furinalis during the four phases of its reproductive cycle. Testes of 18 adult males, divided into four sample groups (active, regressing, regressed, and recrudescence phases), were submitted to morphological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical analyzes. The results demonstrate that the processes of testicular regression and recrudescence of E. furinalis are under the control of pituitary, androgen and estrogen hormones. The regulation is exerted mainly through the activation and cross signaling of AR and FSHR in Sertoli cells and of LHR in Leydig cells. The testicular regression appears to be activated by an inhibition/reduction of AR expression in Sertoli cells, which inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of new spermatogonia and causes the deactivation of spermatogenesis. Conversely, the testicular recrudescence occurs by the increasing of the expression of LHR in Leydig cells, and AR and FSHR in Sertoli cells, which reactivates the testicular production of androgens and estrogens, the proliferation of spermatogonia and restarts the spermatogenesis.",

            "abstractNote": "A new maternity colony of lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros) was found and described in an abandoned building in Aljezur, Portugal. Between June 25 and July 4, 2022, we conducted emergence and juvenile counts, took light intensity measurements during emergence times and evaluated microclimatic conditions inside the roost, namely temperature and relative humidity. Moreover, we took ultrasound recordings in the open and performed transects to locate foraging areas and commuting corridors. We found the colony amounted to at least 501 individuals (371 adults and 130 juveniles), currently the largest known in Portugal and one of the biggest in Europe. Sixteen matching echolocation calls were recorded away from the colony near a water reservoir, a probable foraging area together with the Vale da Telha valley connecting the roost to the water body, which may also serve as a commuting corridor. Considering the threatened conservation status of the lesser horseshoe bat, the large colony size and its lack of protection, we proposed several conservation measures aimed at preserving the colony. We hope our recommendations will be included in the management plan currently being prepared for the Natura 2000 site Costa Sudoeste. Following up on this research, a radio-tracking study would definitively confirm the bats’ movements and foraging grounds.",

Here, I review the social structure and mating systems of 4 nominal species in the Old World fruit bat genus Cynopterus, and explore the relationship between roosting ecology, the size and stability of female groups, and variation in degree of polygyny. Intraspeciﬁc comparisons for C. brachyotis Sunda and C. sphinx suggest that the distribution and availability of suitable roost sites has a strong inﬂuence on the dispersion of females among males. Examination of paternity data for C. sphinx demonstrates a direct relationship between the environmental potential for polygyny and variance in male reproductive success: a 2-fold increase in mean harem size due to reduction in roost availability produces a 2-fold increase in reproductive skew among males. However, in C. brachyotis Sunda, C. sphinx, and C. horsﬁeldii, low ﬁdelity of females to roosts or males is consistent, regardless of roost dispersion or permanence. In contrast, female C. brachyotis Forest exhibit high short-term ﬁdelity to males, despite low roost ﬁdelity. It is proposed that female lability is inﬂuenced by the distribution of potential mates and the beneﬁts of multiple mating and, in C. brachyotis Sunda and C. sphinx, is likely to promote both behavioral and cryptic female choice, and male sperm competition.",

During the Pleistocene glacial cycles and associated sea level fluctuations, the Sunda region in Southeast Asia experienced concurrent changes in landmass area and the ratio of forest to open habitat, providing an ideal setting to test the expectation that habitat associations played an important role in determining species’ response to the opportunity for geographic expansion. We used mitochondrial control region sequences and six microsatellite loci to compare the phylogeographic structure and demographic histories of four broadly sympatric species of Old World fruit bats in the genus, Cynopterus. Two forest-associated species and two open-habitat generalists were sampled along a latitudinal transect in Singapore, peninsular Malaysia, and southern Thailand. Contrary to expectations based on habitat associations, the geographic scale of population structure was not concordant across ecologically similar species. We found evidence for long and relatively stable demographic history in one forest and one open-habitat species, and inferred non-coincident demographic expansions in the second forest and open-habitat species. Thus, while these results indicate that Pleistocene climate change did not have a single effect on population structure across species, a correlation between habitat association and response to environmental change was supported in only two of four species. We conclude that interactions between multiple factors, including historical and contemporary environmental change, species-specific ecology and interspecific interactions, have shaped the recent evolutionary histories of Cynopterus fruit bats in Southeast Asia.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease of hibernating bats linked to the death of an estimated 5.7 million or more bats in the northeastern United States and Canada. White-nose syndrome is caused by the cold-loving fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), which invades the skin of the muzzles, ears, and wings of hibernating bats. Previous work has shown that WNS-affected bats arouse to euthermic or near euthermic temperatures during hibernation significantly more frequently than normal and that these too-frequent arousals are tied to severity of infection and death date. We quantified the behavior of bats during these arousal bouts to understand better the causes and consequences of these arousals. We hypothesized that WNS-affected bats would display increased levels of activity (especially grooming) during their arousal bouts from hibernation compared to WNS-unaffected bats. Behavior of both affected and unaffected hibernating bats in captivity was monitored from December 2010 to March 2011 using temperature-sensitive dataloggers attached to the backs of bats and infrared motion-sensitive cameras. The WNS-affected bats exhibited significantly higher rates of grooming, relative to unaffected bats, at the expense of time that would otherwise be spent inactive. Increased self-grooming may be related to the presence of the fungus. Elevated activity levels in affected bats likely increase energetic stress, whereas the loss of rest (inactive periods when aroused from torpor) may jeopardize the ability of a bat to reestablish homeostasis in a number of physiologic systems.",

            "abstractNote": "Information about the population genetic structures of parasites is important for an understanding of parasite transmission pathways and ultimately the co-evolution with their hosts. If parasites cannot disperse independently of their hosts, a parasite’s population structure will depend upon the host’s spatial distribution. Geographical barriers affecting host dispersal can therefore lead to structured parasite populations. However, how the host’s social system affects the genetic structure of parasite populations is largely unknown. We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to describe the spatio-temporal population structure of a contact-transmitted parasitic wing mite (Spinturnix bechsteini) and compared it to that of its social host, the Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii). We observed no genetic differentiation between mites living on different bats within a colony. This suggests that mites can move freely among bats of the same colony. As expected in case of restricted inter-colony dispersal, we observed a strong genetic differentiation of mites among demographically isolated bat colonies. In contrast, we found a strong genetic turnover between years when we investigated the temporal variation of mite haplotypes within colonies. This can be explained with mite dispersal occuring between colonies and bottlenecks of mite populations within colonies. The observed absence of isolation by distance could be the result from genetic drift and ⁄ or from mites dispersing even between remote bat colonies, whose members may meet at mating sites in autumn or in hibernacula in winter. Our data show that the population structure of this parasitic wing mite is influenced by its own demography and the peculiar social system of its bat host.",

            "abstractNote": "For species characterized by philopatry of both sexes, mate selection represents an important behaviour for inbreeding avoidance, yet the implications for gene ﬂow are rarely quantiﬁed. Here, we present evidence of male gamete-mediated gene ﬂow resulting from extra-group mating in Spix’s disc-winged bat, Thyroptera tricolor, a species which demonstrates all-offspring philopatry. We used microsatellite and capture–recapture data to characterize social group structure and the distribution of mated pairs at two sites in southwestern Costa Rica over four breeding seasons. Relatedness and genetic spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated strong kinship within groups and over short distances (<50 m), resulting from matrilineal group structure and small roosting home ranges (~0.2 ha). Despite high relatedness among-group members, observed inbreeding coefﬁcients were low (FIS = 0.010 and 0.037). Parentage analysis indicated mothers and offspring belonged to the same social group, while fathers belonged to different groups, separated by large distances (~500 m) when compared to roosting home ranges. Simulated random mating indicated mate choice was not based on intermediate levels of relatedness, and mated pairs were less related than adults within social groups on average. Isolation-by-distance (IBD) models of genetic neighbourhood area based on father–offspring distances provided direct estimates of mean gamete dispersal distances (^r) > 10 roosting home range equivalents. Indirect estimates based on genetic distance provided even larger estimates of ^r, indicating direct estimates were biased low. These results suggest extra-group mating reduces the incidence of inbreeding in T. tricolor, and male gamete dispersal facilitates gene ﬂow in lieu of natal dispersal of young.",

Our aim was to compare the general ovary morphology and the folliculogenesis process in these species to increase the knowledge about the reproductive diversity of tropical bats. We observed a morphological distinction between the ovaries of both species: A. planirostris presents the primordial follicles located in a cranial portion of the ovary and the interstitial gland cells are not distinctive, while in E. furinalis, the primordial follicles are located throughout the cortex, and there is an abundance of interstitial gland cells. Both species present binovular or triovular follicles. Artibeus planirostris is a monovular species, with a preferential ovulation in the left side. Some females of E. furinalis exhibited two corpora lutea in the same ovary, and others presented a corpus luteum in both right and left ovaries at the same time; thus, E. furinalis is a polyovular species. Our results express the variation between two Neotropical species, reflecting the great variation in the reproductive aspects in Chiroptera.",

We acoustically monitored for bat species that produce low freque echolocation calls (<30 kHz minimum frequency), specifically Hoary Bat ( Lasiurus cinere Silver-haired Bat, and Big Brown Bat ( Eptesicus fuscus) at 40 sites in 16 locations across South Alaska from 2011 to 2013 using passive bat detectors. The Hoary Bat was not previously kno from Alaska, but we recorded 25 call files of this species (of 26,151 low frequency bat files) sites in northern Southeast Alaska (4 mainland sites and 1 site on Chichagof Island); an addit 110 call files were classified as probable Hoary Bat, but were ambiguous. We recorded 307 files that contained echolocation calls diagnostic of Silver-haired Bats; no files had character diagnostic of Big Brown Bats. The rest of the low frequency recordings were identified probable Silver-haired Bat calls, although Big Brown Bats cannot be ruled out due to extensive overlap of acoustic characteristics between these 2 species. We recorded Hoary almost exclusively during the autumn migration period. By contrast, Silver-haired Bats w detected throughout the summer active season, indicating at least some individuals are resid in Southeast Alaska. Silver-haired Bat activity was greatest at sites on or near the mainland, w most sites showing peaks of activity in spring, suggesting bats from the interior ma overwintering in the region. Winter recordings suggest Silver-haired Bats (and Big Brown Ba present) are active to some extent during winter in Southeast Alaska. Understanding distribution and seasonality of Hoary and Silver-haired Bat activity in Southeast Alaska critical 1st step toward identifying their habitat requirements and conservation needs in region.",

The Silver-haired Bat suffered few external injuries, the most conspicuous of which were a missing lower right canine and small puncture wounds on the left wing membrane. The Hoary Bat experienced much more extensive external injuries, including sub-dermal bleeding on wing and tail membranes and bite marks and tears in both wings. Few published accounts describe physical altercations among bats, but Hoary Bats are frequently involved. Rabies is often implicated as a driving factor in the aggressive interactions. We decided not to euthanize the bat for rabies testing, but encourage others who encounter these types of interactions to have bats tested.",

            "abstractNote": "The small population and limited range of the Samoan ¯ying fox Pteropus samoensis has generated concern regarding the survival of this large, diurnally active bat. During 1995±96, surveys were conducted monthly in six study valleys on Tutuila Island, American Samoa, to assess population size. The amount of diurnal and nocturnal activity was investigated to gauge the accuracy of diurnal surveys, and territorial behaviours were observed to determine how they in¯uenced local dispersion. Individuals showed long-term ®delity to a series of roosts and small core areas that were used both nocturnally and diurnally. Territorial defence was observed only of temporary feeding territories in fruiting or ¯owering trees. Bats defended food resources by aerial patrols and extended aerial chases in which intruders were frequently bitten. Foraging movements changed seasonally, with up to 80% of individuals observed bypassing study valleys. The mean density of bats observed within the study valleys was 6.1 bats/km2 (range = 0.9±18.5 bats/km2). Pteropus samoensis were active both nocturnally and diurnally with greatest activity in late afternoon and evening, 16:00±22:00. Because bats were most active at night, it is probable that daytime surveys of ¯ying bats undercount the number of individuals present. Greatest densities were found in valleys that were contiguous with large tracts of forest inaccessible to people. Most observations of roosting bats were of solitary males on dead branches that jutted above the forest canopy, while females and dependant young roosted below the canopy, hidden within vegetation. Adult male±female pairs were rarely seen together other than during the mating period in August±January. The population has increased following a ban on hunting, but reliance on mature forest makes long-term species survival dependant on protection of the limited mature forest remaining and continued hunting restrictions.",

However, Ozark big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) are highly susceptible to human disturbance.

            "abstractNote": "Whereas it is generally agreed that the Neotropical bat family Mormoopidae, as well as the two mormoopid genera (Mormoops and Pteronotus) are each monophyletic, relationships among the six extant species of Pteronotus remain unresolved. The purpose of this study was to evaluate phylogenetic relationships within Pteronotus using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial ribosomal and cytochrome b genes and the nuclear Recombination Activating Gene-2 based on likelihood inferential techniques (maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics). Results of this study present, for the first time, a fully resolved and strongly supported phylogeny for all relationships within Pteronotus. These data strongly support: sister-group relationships between davyi and gymnonotus (subgenus pteronotus), between macleayii and quadridens (subgenus chilonycteris), and between the subgenera pteronotus and chilonycteris. Pteronotus personatus is sister to this clade and P. parnellii is the most basal lineage of Pteronotus. Although this is the first study to provide a fullyresolved and strongly supported hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships among species of Pteronotus, future work must focus on phylogeographic surveys within each species because previous studies have suggested that parnellii and personatus may contain undescribed species.",

Initial analysis showed that in addition to the echolocation calls at 81–84 kHz there were ultrasound calls at lower frequencies. Simultaneous recordings of ultrasound and low frequency signals (1–10 kHz) showed that echolocation pulses, ultrasound social calls and low frequency social calls were quite distinct in both duration, frequency and number of calls. Twelve types of ultrasound social calls were identified. The majority of calls were in the range 20–29 kHz and 1–49 ms duration. Variability was found in the relative power of the fundamental and harmonics of the calls. This analysis has identified a substantial repertoire of calls used by R. ferrumequinum in a nursery roost colony. The possibility of the use of a male advertisement call in the roost is discussed.",

There is a need for immortalized bat cell lines to culture and investigate the pathogenicity, replication kinetics, and evolution of emerging coronaviruses. We illustrate the susceptibility and permissiveness of a spontaneously immortalized kidney cell line (Rhileki) from Blyth’s horseshoe bat (R. lepidus) to SARS-CoV-2 virus, including clinical isolates, suggesting a possible virus-host relationship. We were able to observe limited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Rhileki cells compared with simian VeroE6 cells. Slower viral replication in Rhileki cells was indicated by higher ct values (RT-PCR) at later time points of the viral culture and smaller foci (foci forming assay) compared with those of VeroE6 cells. With this study we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not restricted to R. sinicus and could include more Rhinolophus species. The establishment of a continuous Rhinolophus lepidus kidney cell line allows further characterization of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Rhinolophus bat cells, as well as isolation attempts of other bat-borne viruses.",

Five of the\n              Histoplasma\n              isolates from the bats were subsequently identified as Latin American (LA) clade A, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) class 6. These observations raised concern as to whether the commercially available HAg test could detect\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen not of the North American clade upon which the HAg test had been developed. To evaluate this concern, a murine model of disseminated histoplasmosis was established, and mice were infected with multiple LA\n              Histoplasma\n              isolates, including clinical isolates recovered from Brazilian AIDS patients (RFLP class 5 and class 6) and isolates recovered from the bats during the outbreak (RFLP class 6).\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen was detected in all infected mice in our experiments, even when\n              Histoplasma\n              was not recovered in culture. Because the currently available HAg test is able to detect\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen in mice infected with Latin American isolates, this suggests that bat host factors rather than differences among\n              Histoplasma\n              RFLP classes were responsible for the inability to detect HAg in infected bats.",

Conspecifics may also get attracted towards distress calls as a behaviour of cooperative mobbing or just selfishly assessing the potential source of danger. The exact functions of distress calls in bats therefore vary to a great degree and are very hard to pinpoint. We conducted playback experiments to test the response of short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx towards the distress calls of their conspecifics from related and unrelated sites. Bats were attracted to their conspecifics from both related and unrelated sites and in one occasion towards fruit bat (Rousettus leschenaulti) of another genus within the same family. The response towards the opposite sex was significant in most of the playback trials and the reasons remain unclear. This symmetric response towards conspecifics from related and unrelated sites suggests the possibility of fruit bats building social relationships among unrelated individuals and probably between species.",

The genus consists of 7 species, 4 broadly distributed through the Caribbean and mainland of North and South America, and 3 species limited to the Greater Antilles archipelago. We present a brief review of the taxonomic history, redefine the genus, and consider some questions that remain concerning the biology and systematics of the group. A new species, Cameronieta almaensis n. sp., is described from the wings of Pteronotus parnellii collected from the Serra das Almas Reserve, in the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil. This is the first record of Cameronieta from Brazil.",

Here, we report on the predation of a protected species of pipistrelle bat by S. nobilis in Britain. To our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of a Theridiidae spider preying on a bat globally, the first case of a Theridiidae spider preying on a vertebrate in Britain, and the first global case of a Steatoda preying on a mammal.",

The inflorescence of\n              Ficus\n              , hereafter referred to as the ‘fig’, is an enclosed receptacle lined with unisexual flowers. The flowers of\n              Ficus\n              species are pollinated by wasps that feed on galled fig ovules as larvae and that lay eggs in fig flowers as adults (Weiblen 2002). Ripe figs are consumed by vertebrate frugivores, which are the primary dispersers of fig seeds (Shanahan\n              et al.\n              2001). The interaction between figs, pollinators and frugivores introduces the potential for conflict between the roles of raising fig wasps and dispersing seeds. Specifically, the pollination mutualism could be compromised if frugivores consumed figs containing pollinator larvae. This conflict is resolved in very different ways according to the breeding system of the fig.",

Of 28 pairs of autooomes 4 are metacentric, two of them are small-sized, and 24 are acrocentric. One pair of middle-sized acrocentric autosomes is provided with satellites, and among small elements only one pair is punctiform. The X chromosome is a large submetacentric one: its average centromere index is 2,89. The Y chromosome is small and oblong. A comparison has been made between the karyogram of Rhinolophus mehelyi and those of Rh. ferrumequinum, Rh. euryale, Rh. blasii and Rh. hipposideros. The results speak in favour of the opinion of CAPANNA and CIVITELLI (1964), and CAPANNA, CIVITELLI and CoNTI (1967) on the significance of the morphologically identical chromosomes: their role in the phylogeny of Rhinolophid bats was discussed.",

None of the examined species were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium following the global test for heterozygote deficiency. Inbreeding coefficient (FIS) values at the species level also were statistically greater than zero. This may indicate some level of inbreeding in all examined taxa although it seems to be relatively low because significant FIS values were recorded in only 2 swarming sites of M. mystacinus, 2 sites of M. brandtii, and 3 sites of M. alcathoe. However, almost 10% of related individuals sharing 1 parent (i.e., half siblings) were found in the same swarming sites for M. mystacinus and M. brandtii, with fewer observed in M. alcathoe. At the population level, 4.1%, 5.9%, and 8.7% of individuals of M. mystacinus, M. brandtii, and M. alcathoe, respectively, were assigned as full siblings. These figures suggest the possibility of females mating selectively with the same male in more than 1 year.",

            "abstractNote": "The serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus is the most frequently rabies-infected (European bat lyssavirus 1-type, EBLV-1) bat species in Europe. To confirm Lyssavirus infection of this bat in Poland, we tested for the presence of rabies virus RNA from oropharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR. There was a 0.9% (two out of 212 individuals) level of infection within the overall population of serotine bats studied. However, an appreciation of the potential for pathogen transmission and disease risk requires an understanding of the dispersal of the primary host, and any large-scale geographic barriers that may impede gene flow. Thus, we also studied the patterns of bat dispersal via population genetics using nuclear (seven microsatellite loci) and mitochondrial (mtDNA control region) markers, examined in 12 subpopulations distributed across the country. Molecular analyses of microsatellite loci indicated high genetic diversity at all sites (heterozygosity observed, HO = 0.53–0.78), and extremely weak genetic structure in the Polish population of the species. The overall FST was 0.012 (95% confidence interval: 0.006–0.020), and pairwise values ranged from 0.00 to 0.05. Only 22% of individuals were assigned to the subpopulation from which they were sampled. The Bayesian approach implemented in STRUCTURE also confirmed that all examined subpopulations should be treated as a single group, indicating a high level of gene flow. There was some evidence for female philopatry (genetic differentiation was greater in maternally-inherited mtDNA than nuclear DNA) and male-biased dispersal, e.g., HO and the variance of mean assignment were significantly higher in males than in females. Twelve individuals (seven females and five males) were identified as potential first generation migrants. Their migration routes ranged from 60–283 km in females (0 ± SE = 177.9 ± 29.37) to 27–385 km in males (206.4 ± 58.95); surprisingly, no sexual differences were observed and this finding suggests that female-mediated gene flow may occur. MtDNA also produced a strong genetic signal for the demographic expansion (Fu’s FS statistics, FS = -26.30, P < 0.01 and a star-shaped haplotype network), which took place roughly 33,000 years BP, i.e., before the Last Glacial Maximum. The genetic uniformity of the Polish population implies that there is no migration barrier to EBLV-1, at least within the country, and the potential threat of rabies virus spreading via migration of infected animals may be higher than previously thought.",

Here, I present the ﬁrst description of the use of two tents by Recife Broad-nosed Bat, Platyrrhinus reciﬁnus, constructed in leaves of Miconia brunnea in a degraded Brazilian Atlantic forest fragment. Both structures had the architectural style of tents-boat/apical. The shape of the leaves may mediate the architecture of these tents. In addition, they observed that only one male attended the two tents during the same night. This description provides new insights into the biology and behaviour of Platyrrhinus species. I further highlight several unknown for most tent-making bats that merit future research.",

Seven (12.3%) of 57 bats screened in this study showed yeasts in their faeces. Five species of the genus Candida were isolated: C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C. pelliculosa. No phospholipase activity was detected in the egg yolk plate assay; however, all isolates demonstrated protease secretion in skim milk agar. Yeasts isolated from bats produced bioﬁlm on the surface of polystyrene plates and all were classiﬁed as intermediate bioﬁlm producers. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for ﬂuconazole in the yeasts varied according to the species. Only one isolate (M34 – C. lusitaniae) was considered susceptible dose-dependent to ﬂuconazole. The yeasts were injected intravenously into Swiss mice, and at 15 days post-infection, the animals were killed and portions of their kidneys cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar medium. All tissues analysed showed positive cultures of Candida spp. This is the ﬁrst study evaluating the presence of fungi in the faeces of bats in an urban region, where the yeast species found were shown to be potentially pathogenic. As bats are commonly found in cities, these ﬁndings indicate the need for continuous surveillance concerning environmental contamination by their excreta.",

In predator–prey interactions that involve an active chase, pursuit behaviour can be studied as the collection of rules that dictate how a predator should steer to capture prey. It remains unclear how variable this behaviour is within and across species since most studies have detailed the pursuit behaviour of high-speed, open-area foragers. In this study, we analyse the pursuit behaviour in 44 successful captures by\n              Corynorhinus townsendii\n              , Townsend's big-eared bat (\n              n\n              = 4). This species forages close to vegetation using slow and highly manoeuvrable flight, which contrasts with the locomotor capabilities and feeding ecologies of other taxa studied to date. Our results indicate that this species relies on an initial stealthy approach, which is generally sufficient to capture prey (32 out of 44 trials). In cases where the initial approach is not sufficient to perform a capture attempt (12 out of 44 trials),\n              C. townsendii\n              continues its pursuit by reacting to prey movements in a manner best modelled with a combination of pure pursuit, or following prey directly, and proportional navigation, or moving to an interception point.",

            "abstractNote": "Mercury (Hg) is increasing in marine food webs, especially at high latitudes. The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of methyl mercury (MeHg) has serious effects on wildlife, and is most evident in apex predators. The MeHg body burden in birds is the balance of ingestion and excretion, and MeHg in feathers is an effective indicator of overall MeHg burden. Ivory gulls (\n              Pagophila eburnea\n              ), which consume ice-associated prey and scavenge marine mammal carcasses, have the highest egg Hg concentrations of any Arctic bird, and the species has declined by more than 80% since the 1980s in Canada. We used feathers from museum specimens from the Canadian Arctic and western Greenland to assess whether exposure to MeHg by ivory gulls increased from 1877 to 2007. Based on constant feather stable-isotope (\n              δ\n              13\n              C,\n              δ\n              15\n              N) values, there was no significant change in ivory gulls' diet over this period, but feather MeHg concentrations increased 45× (from 0.09 to 4.11 µg g\n              −1\n              in adults). This dramatic change in the absence of a dietary shift is clear evidence of the impact of anthropogenic Hg on this high-latitude threatened species. Bioavailable Hg is expected to increase in the Arctic, raising concern for continued population declines in high-latitude species that are far from sources of environmental contaminants.",

Eleven populations from four countries (Benin, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Senegal) had comparable levels of genetic diversity, although the two populations in the extreme west (Senegal) had less diversity. Pairwise\n              F\n              ST\n              ranged from 0.02 to 0.28 and increased with geographic distance, even at a regional scale. Gene pools detected by Bayesian clustering seem to be a byproduct of the isolation‐by‐distance pattern rather than representing actual discrete entities. The organization of genetic diversity appears to result essentially from spatially restricted gene flow, with some influences of human seed exchange. Despite the potential for relatively long‐distance pollen and seed dispersal by bats within populations, statistically significant spatial genetic structuring within populations (SGS) was detected and gave a mean indirect estimate of neighborhood size of ca. 45. This study demonstrated that relatively high levels of genetic structuring are present in baobab at both large and within‐population level, which was unexpected in regard to its dispersal by bats and the influence of human exchange of seeds. Implications of these results for the conservation of baobab populations are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The ovaries of early embryos (40 days post coitum/p.c.) of the bat Carollia perspicillata contain numerous germ-line cysts, which are composed of 10 to 12 sister germ cells (cystocytes). Variability in the number of cystocytes within the cyst and between the cysts (defying the Giardina rule) indicates that the mitotic divisions of the cystoblast are asynchronous in this bat species. Serial section analysis showed that the cystocytes are interconnected via intercellular bridges that are atypical, strongly elongated, short-lived, and rich in microtubule bundles and microﬁlaments. During slightly later stages of embryonic development (44–46 days p.c.), somatic cells penetrate the cyst, and their cytoplasmic projections separate individual oocytes. Separated oocytes surrounded by a single layer of somatic cells constitute the primordial ovarian follicles. The oocytes of C. perspicillata are similar to mouse oocytes and are asymmetric. In both species, this asymmetry is clearly recognizable in the localization of the Golgi complexes. The presence of germ-line cysts and intercellular bridges (although noncanonical) in the fetal ovaries of C. perspicillata suggest that the formation of germ-line cysts is an evolutionarily conserved phase in the development of the female gametes in a substantial part of the animal kingdom. genesis 50:18–27, 2012.

In this study, R. ferrumequinum korai showed a distinct reproductive cycle, unlike other hibernating bat species. The testicular reproductive cycle of R. ferrumequinum korai consists of three main stages. The ﬁrst is the spermatogenesis stage (from April to September), including spermatocytogenesis (which appears from April to May) and spermiogenesis (from June to September). The activity of spermatogenesis was highest in August. The lumen of seminiferous tubules was open from mid-April to mid-October. It was closed from November to March of the following year. The second stage is the phagocytosis stage (from mid-October to mid-November), which is a puriﬁcation process to prepare for new spermatogenesis the following year. This period is called the cleansing period. The third is the dormant stage – that is, a state of holding only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. It is an adaptation strategy to store energy for long periods of hibernation. Compared to previous studies, spermatogenesis period preceded 1 month earlier. This suggests that temperature increase can impact reproductive development and spermatogenesis.",

            "abstractNote": "In this study to investigate the male reproductive cycle of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum korai, we focused on monthly morphological changes of cauda epididymis, sperm inﬁltration into cauda epididymis, sperm storage and sperm destruction. The caudal epididymal reproductive cycle consisted of two successive purge stages. The ﬁrst stage of sperm disappearance occurred from April to June. This was a preparation phase for accepting new sperm produced by spermatogenesis, and entailed removing long-stored spermatozoa from the cauda epididymis during the long hibernation period. The second stage of sperm disappearance occurred from July to August, to remove malformed spermatozoa and other residues that were formed during the spermatogenesis process. Therefore, cauda epididymis cleansing lasts about 5 months, from April to August. This period is called the cleansing period. Sperm destruction was achieved by regulating leukocyte phagocytosis and the secretion and uptake by epithelial cells of cauda epididymis. Compared to the author’s previous studies, morphological traits of the cauda epididymis changed 1 month earlier. This suggests that temperature increase can impact reproductive development of the epididymis. Caudal epididymal sperm did not show any sudden morphological change during the long hibernation period after mating. This might be related to a low metabolic rate during hibernation.",

            "abstractNote": "Closely related species have been used as representative systems to investigate the genetic mechanisms involved in the early stages of species differentiation. Previous studies have indicated that variation in gene expression might be a sensitive indicator of initial species divergence, although the role of expression divergence, and especially that associated with phenotypic variation remained relatively undefined. For three organs (cochlea, brain, and liver) from two closely related bat species (Rhinolophus siamensis and R. episcopus), the interspecific and intersubspecific gene expression profiles were compared using transcriptomics in this study. Striking organ specificity of expression was observed, and expression profiles exhibited similarities between cochlea and brain tissues. Numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for each organ in the interspecific comparison (cochlea/brain/liver: 1,069/647/692) and intersubspecific comparison (608/528/368). Functional enrichment analysis indicated vital variation in expression related to the immune system, ion activities, neuronal function, and multisensory system regulation in both comparisons. DEGs relevant to the variation in echolocation calls (RF) were found, and some of them were involved in the pivotal patterns of expression variation. The regulation of immune, ion channel, neural activity, and sophisticated sensory functions at the expression level might be key mechanisms in the early species divergence of bats, and the expression variation related to acoustical signal could have played a crucial part. This study expands our knowledge of gene expression and patterns of variation for three key organs to echolocation at both the interspecific and intersubspecific levels. Further, the framework described here provides insight into the genetic basis of phenotypic variation during the incipient stage of species differentiation.",

However, little is known about their roles in generating novel phenotypes and phenotypic variation during the course of animal evolution. Here, we, for the first time, characterized the miRNAs of the cochlea in an echolocating bat (Rhinolophus affinis). We sampled eight individuals from two R. affinis subspecies with significant echolocation call frequency differences. We identified 365 miRNAs and 121 of them were novel. By searching sequences of these miRNAs precursors in multiple high-­quality mammal genomes, we found one specific miRNA shared by all echolocating bats but not present in all other nonecholocating mammals. The targeted genes of this miRNA included several known hearing genes (e.g., KCNQ4 and GJB6). Together with the matched mRNA-­seq data, we identified 1766 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two subspecies and 555 of them were negatively regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). We found that almost half of known hearing genes in the list of all DEGs were regulated negatively by DEMs, suggesting an important role of miRNAs in call frequency variation of the two subspecies. These targeted DEGs included several important hearing genes (e.g., Piezo1, Piezo2, and CDH23) that have been shown to be important in ultrasonic hearing of echolocating mammals.",

In China, two morphologically similar bent-winged bat species, Miniopterus fuliginosus and Miniopterus magnater were identiﬁed, but their distribution range and genetic differentiation are largely unexplored. In this study, we applied DNA bar codes and two other mitochondrial DNA genes including morphological parameters to determine the phylogeny, genetic differentiation, spatial distribution, and morphological difference of the M. fuliginosus and M. magnater sampled from China and one site in Vietnam. Mitochondrial DNA gene genealogies revealed two monophyletic lineages throughout the Tropic of Cancer. According to DNA bar code divergences, one is M. fuliginosus corresponding to the Chinese mainland and the other is M. magnater corresponding to tropical regions including Hainan and Guangdong provinces of China and Vietnam. Their most recent common ancestor was dated to the early stage of the Quaternary glacial period (ca. 2.26 million years ago [Ma] on the basis of D-loop data, and ca. 1.69–2.37 Ma according to ND2). A population expansion event was inferred for populations of M. fuliginosus at 0.14 Ma. The two species probably arose in separate Pleistocene refugia under different climate zones. They signiﬁcantly differed in forearm length, maxillary third molar width, and greatest length of the skull.",

            "abstractNote": "Since European settlement in Australia, the geographical range of ghost bats (Macroderma gigas) has contracted northwards. Ghost bats are thought to occur in disjunct populations with little interpopulation migration, raising concerns over the current status and future viability of the southernmost colony, which has also been threatened by mining activity. To address these concerns, demographic parameters of the southernmost colony were estimated from a mark–recapture study conducted during 1975–1981. Female bats gave birth to a single young in late spring, but only 40% (22–70%, 95% CI) of females bred in their second year, increasing to 93% (87–97%, 95% CI) for females ≥ 2 years old. Sixty-ﬁve percent of juveniles caught were female. Annual adult survival ranged between 0.57–0.77 for females and 0.43–0.66 for males, and was lowest over winter–spring and greatest in autumn–winter. Juvenile survival for the ﬁrst year ranged between 0.35–0.46 for females and 0.29–0.42 for males. Adult survival varied among seasons, was negatively associated with rainfall, but was not associated with temperature beyond being lower in late winter. Poor survival may result from the inferior daytime roosts that bats must use if water seepage forces them to leave their normal roosts. Although these age-speciﬁc rates of fecundity and survival suggested a declining population, mark–recapture estimates of the population trend indicated stability over the study period. Counts at daytime roosts also suggested a population decline, but were considered unreliable because of an increasing tendency of bats to avoid detection. It is therefore likely that some assumptions in estimating survival were violated. These results provide a caution against the uncritical use of population projections derived from mark–recapture estimates of demographic parameters, and the use of untested indices as the basis for conservation decisions.",

            "abstractNote": "A vaccine that effectively protects immunocompromised patients against invasive aspergillosis is a novel approach to a universally fatal disease. Here we present a rationale for selection and in vivo testing of potential protein vaccine candidates, based on the modification of an immunodominant fungal allergen for which we demonstrate immunoprotective properties. Pulmonary exposure to viable Aspergillus fumigatus conidia as well as vaccination with crude hyphal extracts protects corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mice against invasive aspergillosis (J. I. Ito and J. M. Lyons, J. Infect. Dis. 186:869-871, 2002). Sera from the latter animals contain antibodies with numerous and diverse antigen specificities, whereas sera from conidium-exposed mice contain antibodies predominantly against allergen Asp f 3 (and some against Asp f 1), as identified by mass spectrometry. Subcutaneous immunization with recombinant Asp f 3 (rAsp f 3) but not with Asp f 1 was protective. The lungs of Asp f 3-vaccinated survivors were free of hyphae and showed only a patchy low-density infiltrate of mononuclear cells. In contrast, the nonimmunized animals died with invasive hyphal elements and a compact peribronchial infiltrate of predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Three truncated versions of rAsp f 3, spanning amino acid residues 15 to 168 [rAsp f 3(15-168)], 1 to 142, and 15 to 142 and lacking the known bipartite sequence required for IgE binding, were also shown to be protective. Remarkably, vaccination with either rAsp f 3(1-142) or rAsp f 3(15-168) drastically diminished the production of antigen-specific antibodies compared to vaccination with the full-length rAsp f 3(1-168) or the double-truncated rAsp f 3(15-142) version. Our findings point to a possible mechanism in which Asp f 3 vaccination induces a cellular immune response that upon infection results in the activation of lymphocytes that in turn enhances and/or restores the function of corticosteroid-suppressed macrophages to clear fungal elements in the lungs.",

            "abstractNote": "Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are one of many species within zoologic collections that frequently develop iron storage disease. The goals of this retrospective multi-institutional study were to determine the tissue distribution of iron storage in captive adult Egyptian fruit bats and the incidence of intercurrent neoplasia and infection, which may be directly or indirectly related to iron overload. Tissue sections from 83 adult Egyptian fruit bats were histologically evaluated by using tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, and Prussian blue techniques. The liver and spleen consistently had the largest amount of iron, but signiﬁcant amounts of iron were also detected in the pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, and lung. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 11) was the most common neoplasm, followed by cholangiocarcinoma (4). Extrahepatic neoplasms included bronchioloalveolar adenoma (3), pulmonary carcinosarcoma (1), oral sarcoma (1), renal adenocarcinoma (1), transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (1), mammary gland adenoma (1), and parathyroid adenoma (1). There were also metastatic neoplasms of undetermined primary origin that included three poorly differentiated carcinomas, a poorly differentiated sarcoma, and a neuroendocrine tumor. Bats with hemochromatosis were signiﬁcantly more likely to have HCC than bats with hemosiderosis (P ¼ 0.032). Cardiomyopathy was identiﬁed in 35/77 bats with evaluable heart tissue, but no direct association was found between cardiac damage and the amount of iron observed within the liver or heart. Hepatic abscesses occurred in multiple bats, although a signiﬁcant association was not observed between hemochromatosis and bacterial infection. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst publication providing evidence of a positive correlation between hemochromatosis and HCC in any species other than humans.",

The pellets collected at 152 sites in central and north-eastern Poland in the years 1990–2008 comprised 17,908 items of vertebrate prey, of which 115 (0.64%) were bats. Tawny owls caught 11 bat species, most frequently Nyctalus noctula, Plecotus auritus and Eptesicus serotinus. The analysis revealed habitat-related differences to the proportions of all tawny owl prey items accounted for by bats, being the highest in urban habitats (2.0%) and suburban forests (0.8%), and the lowest in forest interiors (0.1%). Bat frequency in the diet of tawny owls correlated negatively with that of other mammals pooled together with amphibians. Myotis nattereri and ‘‘aerial hawkers’’ (vs. ‘‘gleaners’’) were taken significantly more often in habitats associated with a large city (parks and suburban forests), and P. auritus in non-urban habitats.",

Although lepidopterans comprised only 21.5% of the available prey, they occurred in > 90% of the pellets examined and accounted for > 85% of the volume of prey consumed. Dipterans, coleopterans, and homopterans occurred in 18.3%, 10.6%, and 6.7% of the feces, respectively, but each accounted for < 5% of the volume of prey consumed. Trichopterans, hymenopterans, and neuropterans also were found in feces but in trace amounts. Our results support the classification of C. t. ingens as a moth specialist, but additional insights are needed to fully understand how its feeding tactics conform to the allotonic frequency hypothesis (i.e., avoiding detection by eared moths). Conservation of this highly endangered North American bat will require, in part, maintenance of habitats capable of supporting abundant populations of Lepidoptera.",

Despite their prevalence in urban environments, limited research has been conducted to determine the features of buildings or of the surroundings that might affect the likelihood of a building being selected by Mexican free-tailed bats as a roost. Our study objectives were to improve the current understanding of Mexican free-tailed bat’s urban roosting preferences with regard to both microhabitat and macrohabitat. Between August 2010 and August 2012, we conducted acoustic surveys and emergence observations and examined 218 buildings in Waco, TX, USA. A total of 54 day-roosts for Mexican free-tailed bats was identified. At the microhabitat scale, modeling of building characteristics and opening characteristics showed that bats preferred to roost in tall and abandoned buildings. Roost exits were more likely the results of structural damage to buildings and less likely to have vegetation blocking the adjacent air space. Roost accessibility seemed to be more important than thermal condition in roost selection. At the broader macrohabitat scale, bats were more likely to roost in areas with lower income and were near tall buildings and water sources.",

Eared moths perform evasive flight manoeuvres upon hearing approaching bats, thereby substantially increasing survival probability. Accordingly, eared moths constitute only a minor portion of many bats’ diets. In contrast, the barbastelle bat\n                      Barbastella barbastellus\n                      almost exclusively feeds on eared moths by emitting low‐amplitude stealth echolocation calls that are undetectable by distant moths. While closing in on the prey, however, the calls might become audible. We thus hypothesised that barbastelle bats lower the source level of their calls even further while closing in, such that the level at the moth's ear remains below the moth's hearing threshold and the moth fails to elicit its evasive manoeuvre.\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    We tested these hypotheses by offering tethered moths to barbastelle bats in the wild and in captivity. We reconstructed the bats’ three‐dimensional flight paths based on time‐of‐arrival differences of the echolocation calls at four microphones, measured the received sound levels at the moth's position with an additional miniature microphone, and calculated call source levels.\n                  \n                  \n                    We show that barbastelle bats continuously reduced source level upon detecting a moth, thereby delaying the time and shortening the distance when the moth might detect the bat. The received level at the targeted moth never exceeded the moth's neuronal hearing threshold by more than 10 dB, which is likely sufficiently low to prevent moth evasive flight.\n                  \n                  \n                    Barbastelle bats emit low‐amplitude calls to counter moth hearing. Continued amplitude reduction during an attack extends the time before the prey becomes aware of the predator, if at all. In combination, these two strategies allowed barbastelle bats to access a food resource which is largely unavailable to competing species, thereby probably altering competition between sympatric predators.\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                A\n                plain language summary\n                is available for this article.",

            "abstractNote": "The remarkable high-frequency sensitivity and selectivity of the mammalian auditory system has been attributed to the evolution of mechanical amplification, in which sound waves are amplified by outer hair cells in the cochlea. This process is driven by the recently discovered protein prestin, encoded by the gene\n              Prestin\n              . Echolocating bats use ultrasound for orientation and hunting and possess the highest frequency hearing of all mammals. To test for the involvement of\n              Prestin\n              in the evolution of bat echolocation, we sequenced the coding region in echolocating and nonecholocating species. The resulting putative gene tree showed strong support for a monophyletic assemblage of echolocating species, conflicting with the species phylogeny in which echolocators are paraphyletic. We reject the possibilities that this conflict arises from either gene duplication and loss or relaxed selection in nonecholocating fruit bats. Instead, we hypothesize that the putative gene tree reflects convergence at stretches of functional importance. Convergence is supported by the recovery of the species tree from alignments of hydrophobic transmembrane domains, and the putative gene tree from the intra- and extracellular domains. We also found evidence that\n              Prestin\n              has undergone Darwinian selection associated with the evolution of specialized constant-frequency echolocation, which is characterized by sharp auditory tuning. Our study of a hearing gene in bats strongly implicates\n              Prestin\n              in the evolution of echolocation, and suggests independent evolution of high-frequency hearing in bats. These results highlight the potential problems of extracting phylogenetic signals from functional genes that may be prone to convergence.",

In the mild winter of 1994–1995, ﬂight cage temperatures never fell below 10ЊC. Bats were never observed to enter sustained (over 2 d) torpor. They were also never observed to mate. Unmanipulated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized males and unmanipulated females were exposed to 6 d of 4ЊC. All individuals appeared torpid, and body temperatures of monitored bats fell at least 15Њ–20ЊC. Plasma androgen levels of torpid unmanipulated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized males averaged 25.4 { 9.2, 19.7 { 9.1, and 1.5 { 0.25 ng/mL, respectively, and did not differ signiﬁcantly from levels for the same groups 1 mo previous to induced torpor. When animals were returned to 23ЊC, 57% of unmanipulated, 40% of the sham-operated, and 33% of gonadectomized males displayed mating behavior upon arousal. Almost all matings occurred within 48 h of arousal, the majority in the ﬁrst 3 h. Males not exposed to low temperatures were not observed to mate. Although individuals from all three treatments mated, gonadectomized males averaged fewer mounts and copulations per individual. Androgen levels declined signiﬁcantly from torpor levels in all groups 48 h after arousal. Thus, an extended period of low body temperature and arousal appeared to be a short-term activator of sexual behavior in the big brown bat; unmanipulated males were more strongly affected by this stimulus than gonadectomized males.",

            "abstractNote": "The Cimicidae is a family of blood‐dependent ectoparasites in which dispersion capacity is greatly associated with host movements. Bats are the ancestral and most prevalent hosts for cimicids. Cimicids have a worldwide distribution matching that of their hosts, but the global classification is incomplete, especially for species outside the most common Cimicidae taxa. In this study, we place a little‐studied cimicid species, Bucimex chilensis, within a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Cimicidae by sequencing the genomic regions of this and other closely related species. For this study, we collected B. chilensis females from Myotis chiloensis in Tierra del Fuego, 1,300 km further south than previously known southernmost distribution boundary. We also sequenced COI regions from Primicimex cavernis, a species which together with B. chilensis comprise the entire subfamily Primiciminae. Using Bayesian posterior probability and maximum‐likelihood approaches, we found that B. chilensis and P. cavernis clustered close to each other in the molecular analyses, receiving support from similar morphological features, agreeing with the morphology‐based taxonomic placement of the two species within the subfamily Primiciminae. We also describe a previously unrecognized morphological adaptation of the tarsal structure, which allows the austral bat ectoparasite, B. chilensis, to cling on to the pelage of its known host, the Chilean myotis (Myotis chiloensis). Through a morphological study and behavioral observation, we elucidate how this tarsal structure operates, and we hypothesize that by clinging in the host pelage, B. chilensis is able to disperse effectively to new areas despite low host density. This is a unique feature shared by P. cavernis, the only other species in Primiciminae.",

Notably, bats have been reported to lack obvious symptoms of infection with such viruses and are thought to have unique immune system responses. However, the responses of their innate immune system, the first line of immunity, remain largely unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the expression profiles in two\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cell lines to investigate their innate immune responses. The gene expression profiles after polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] induction were similar between the two bat cell lines, but uniquely upregulated differentially expressed genes were also identified. We also revealed that the upregulated genes of\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cells were distinct from those of human epithelial cells in response to induction. Moreover, the basal expression levels of several immune‐related genes were higher in bat cells than in human cells. We also identified unannotated novel transcripts that were upregulated after induction and novel microRNAs expressed in bat cells, some of which were upregulated by poly (I:C) treatment. This is the first report to illustrate the innate immune response in\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cells; therefore, this study provides basic and novel insights into bat innate immunity. Our data represent a valuable resource for future studies into bat immunity and the biology of\n              Eptesicus\n              bats.",

Analysing DNA in scats through metabarcoding can reveal dietary items not preserved in faeces but also resolve dietary preferences to species level. DNA metabarcoding analysis of scats collected from six individual long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) from Whirinaki Forest Park revealed a predominance of aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera) and small-bodied moths (Lepidoptera). This contrasts with earlier studies of faecal remains in this species which revealed a strong preference for Dipterans and Coleopterans. The use of DNA metabarcoding may provide a better understanding of diets, as soft-bodied insects can be detected even when not apparent in physical examinations of scat, and thus will allow for more robust comparison of diﬀerences in diets between populations and seasons. The application of DNA metabarcoding is a simple but high-resolution tool to allow further study on dietary preference in this endangered species.",

            "abstractNote": "The 60-g subtropical Formosan leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros terasensis, hibernates in the wild at warm roost (and hence body) temperatures up to 23uC. For small hibernators, torpid metabolic rate is temperature dependent and thus hibernation in warm hibernacula is predicted to be energetically costly. This species, however, rarely feeds during the hibernation season to offset the expected high energetic costs. In this study we used a respirometry system to quantify physiological characteristics of euthermic and torpid H. terasensis in winter. We tested the hypothesis that H. terasensis exhibits metabolic inhibition during torpor. Our results showed that H. terasensis saved 94.6% energy by using torpor at air temperatures of 15uC, compared with its euthermic metabolic rate at that air temperature. Torpor metabolic rate declined with declining air temperature to around 14uC, but then increased at lower air temperatures of 10–14uC. Above 14uC , the slope of 213.0uK 6 1.4uK between metabolic rates and body temperatures in an Arrhenius plot (or Q10 5 4.4) suggests that, in addition to direct temperature effects, H. terasensis exhibited metabolic inhibition during torpor. A model used to evaluate energy expenditure of H. terasensis showed that at 20uC and 23uC a 55-g bat needs 194 kJ (4.9 g fat) and 273.2 kJ (6.9 g fat), respectively, to survive a 70-day hibernation period.",

Previous researchers have hypothesized that demographic characteristics of populations may shift with changes in environmental conditions, with self-regulatory ability increasing with environmental suitability. We studied responses of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) to habitat disturbance. Given that optimal habitat for this species is deciduous woodland, we predicted that populations in habitats disturbed by cutting woody vegetation would be lower and more variable in density than in undisturbed habitat, density and stability of populations in disturbed habitat would increase over time, survival would be higher in undisturbed than in disturbed habitat, and populations in undisturbed habitat would show a greater degree of self-regulation. This 6year study in western Pennsylvania involved 3 replicated study sites (each 3.8 ha), with woody vegetation removed on half of each site prior to beginning the study. Density in disturbed treatment averaged 65% of density in undisturbed habitat. There were no differences between treatments in survival or in population growth rates over time. Population trends over time were similar between treatments, populations in disturbed habitat did not become more stable with time, and density did not converge with that of undisturbed habitat. Although populations in the undisturbed habitat were clearly self-regulating, those in disturbed habitats were not. Despite expectations that demographic performance will align with environmental suitability, it may be difficult to ascribe a particular demography to a habitat generalist such as P. leucopus.",

Little is known about its ecology. We used morphological analysis of droppings from an urban semiarid Mediterranean landscape to determine seasonal differences in diet. We identified 15 insect prey types and found significant seasonal differences in the consumption of seven prey types. The diet of E. isabellinus was dominated by Scarabaeidae (Coleoptera) and Diptera, and there were seasonal changes in the consumption of Carabidae (Coleoptera), Lepidoptera and Cercopidae (Hemiptera). Shannon-Wiener and Levins’ indices showed that the diet was more diverse during the post-hibernation and pregnancy periods. Pianka’s index showed that there was relatively low dietary overlap between periods. The seasonal changes recorded between different physiological periods could be related to changes in the energetic needs of the individual or to variation in preyavailability. Although E. isabellinus mainly eats Scarabaeidae and Diptera, it can show flexibility for example by hunting insects that fly around blossoms such as chafers Melolontha spp.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous little brown bats are exposed to elevated concentrations of mercury (Hg) through their preference for aquatic-based prey. Here we investigated spatial patterns of total Hg (THg) in fur from 10 little brown bat maternity colonies across Nova Scotia, and assessed relationships with the acidity of nearby lakes and rivers. Total Hg concentrations were measured in fur samples from 149 adult female little brown bats. Values showed signiﬁcant variation among colonies (mean range 3.76−27.38 μg/g, dry weight), and 48% of individuals had Hg concentrations in excess of the 10 μg/g threshold associated with neurochemical changes in Chiroptera conspeciﬁcs (n = 26) from Virginia. Average surface water acidity parameters (pH and acid neutralization capacity) within an 8 km radius of each maternity roost showed strong negative associations with average colony fur THg concentrations. This suggests that freshwater acidity in foraging grounds explains much of the variation in average fur THg concentrations in little brown bat colonies. These ﬁndings highlight the signiﬁcant role that water quality may have on Hg bioaccumulation within terrestrial species that feed on aquatic prey.",

Deficiency of IFN-gamma but not IL-17A enhanced susceptibility of control mice to both infections. However, vaccine-induced protective immunity against both infections required CD4+ T-cell-derived IFN-gamma and IL-17A, and functional phagocytic effectors. Vaccination primed Th1, Th17, and Th1/17 lymphocytes, which produced pro-inflammatory cytokines that enhanced phagocytic killing of both organisms. Vaccinated, infected mice had increased IFN-gamma, IL-17, and KC, increased neutrophil influx, and decreased organism burden in tissues. In summary, rAls3p-N vaccination induced a Th1/Th17 response, resulting in recruitment and activation of phagocytes at sites of infection, and more effective clearance of S. aureus and C. albicans from tissues. Thus, vaccine-mediated adaptive immunity can protect against both infections by targeting microbes for destruction by innate effectors.",

            "abstractNote": "Ceiba pentandra is a tropical tree with high rates of selﬁng in some populations. In mixed-mating species, variation in selﬁng is due to changes in adult density or variability of incompatibility systems. The effect of spatial isolation and phenology on selﬁng rates and pollen ﬂow distances was analyzed using microsatellites in a fragmented population of Ceiba pentandra, in southern Costa Rica. Adult trees within a heterogeneous landscape were classiﬁed as grouped or isolated. We compared selﬁng rates at the individual level, between isolation conditions and 2 yr (2007, 2009), which differed in the number of ﬂowering individuals. Mixed mating was estimated in both years (tm = 0.624–0.759). Trees mated predominantly by outcrossing, while only a few trees reproduced through selﬁng. Spatial isolation did not signiﬁcantly affect outcrossing rates. The progeny of grouped trees was mostly sired by near-neighbors (<1 km) and by long-distance pollen ﬂow events in isolated trees. A reduction in the number of ﬂowering individuals in 2009 reduced near-neighbor matings, increased selﬁng in grouped trees, and decreased the number of unsampled sires in the progeny. Comparing selﬁng rates on individuals that ﬂowered in both reproductive periods suggests a ﬂexible mating system. Variation in self-fertilization rates in this population appears to depend on variation of individual traits, such as genetic variability in self-incompatibility genes, but it is independent of landscape heterogeneity. In contrast, pollen ﬂow distances depend on local tree density as bats concentrate their foraging between near individuals to maximize energy efﬁciency.",

However, the ecomorphological boundaries of these species are poorly differentiated, and consequently correspondence between their geographic distribution, ecological plasticity and morphological variation remains unclear. In this study, patterns of cranial and mandibular morphological variation were assessed for Carollia brevicauda, C. castanea and C. perspicillata from Colombia. Using geometric morphometrics, morphological variation was examined with respect to: differences in intraspecific variation, morphological modularity and integration, and biogeographic patterns. Patterns of intraspecific variation were different for each species in both cranial and mandibular morphology, with functional differences apparent according to diet. Cranial modularity varied between species whereas mandibular modularity did not. High cranial and mandibular correlation reflects Cranium-Mandible integration as a functional unit. Similarity between the biogeographic patterns in C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata indicates that the Andes do not act as a barrier but rather as an independent region, isolating the morphology of Andean populations of larger-bodied species. The biogeographic pattern for C. castanea was not associated with the physiography of the Andes, suggesting that large body size does not benefit C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata in maintaining homogeneous morphologies among populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Natural and anthropogenic disturbances can strongly impact population dynamics of species and are often responsible for zoonotic emerging infectious diseases. However, long-term studies on the demographic consequences of human disturbances are unusual. We used 6 years (1995–2000) of mark-recapture data to investigate how climatic conditions, human disturbance and density affect sex- and age-speciﬁc apparent survival probabilities of the pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Schreber 1774) in a maternity colony. Our study demonstrated that density played an important role in population dynamics of pipistrelle bat and that its effect differed with respect to age and sex. Notably, human disturbance caused a strong decline of adult female survival, suggesting that perturbations have important consequences in bat-colony dynamics. Juvenile female survival was negatively inﬂuenced by density, being considerably lower in high densities. In contrast, juvenile and adult males were apparently not affected as they had constant survival probabilities. Although climatic factors can markedly affect population dynamics of temperate insectivorous bats, in this study, the weather conditions did not inﬂuence the survival rates of pipistrelle bats. We provide the ﬁrst report that demonstrates the density-dependent effect on bat survival. That is especially relevant to better understanding of the bat-population dynamics and to evaluate the consequences of human disturbance and their potential changes in the maternity colony structure.",

We identiﬁed one order of arachnids (Araneae) and ten orders of insects: Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Orthoptera, Mantodea, Hemiptera, Isoptera, Ephemeroptera, Blattodea and Odonata in a decreasing rank. Coleoptera (31.07%) were Carabidae, Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Tenebrionidae, Aphodidae, Scarabaeidae, and Histeridae. Hymenoptera (21.31%) were Formicidae, Myrmicidae and Vespidae, Diptera (13.78%) were Culicidae and Tabanidae, and Orthoptera (11.40%) were Acrididae and Gryllidae. The autumn-winter diet (October to December) included a large amount of Odonata, Scarabaeidae, Blattodea, Acrididae and Myrmicidae. The spring-summer diet (February to August) was characterized mainly by Chrysomelidae, Vespidae, Tenebrionidae, Aphodidae and Araneae. As other desert bat species A. tridens displays a combination of opportunism and selective predation depending on the abundance of insect groups.",

We used AnaBat II bat detectors, mist-netting, and radio-telemetry to collect preliminary data on the distribution and status of bats on the Chugach National Forest (CNF), their activity patterns, and their roosting and foraging habitats. Myotis spp. were detected at 20 of 25 acoustic sampling sites. Bat activity tended to be higher at water sites than at road or trail sites, and higher in hardwood stands than in conifer stands, although these differences were not statistically significant. Based on data recorded at a maternity roost, the total activity period for bats during July was approximately 5 h per night; no bat activity was observed prior to sunset or after sunrise at any of the sites. Hourly activity was not related to temperature, but activity ended earlier on cooler nights. An adult male Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus) was tracked to a day-roost in a large Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) snag with sloughing bark. Most female Little Brown Myotis captured at a maternity roost were either lactating or post-lactating. These preliminary findings suggest that bats are common on the CNF, but more research is needed to determine their habitat associations and their responses to disturbances including forest management practices, fire, insect outbreaks, climate change, and disease.",

            "abstractNote": "One of the most significant changes to Earth's climate in recent decades has been an increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves. During heatwaves, animal's thermal window can be exceeded, and in extreme cases, mass mortality events have been observed. In 2018, a heatwave in north-­eastern Australia resulted in the death of approximately one-­third of the spectacled flying-­ fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) population at urban roosts in Cairns. The species has now been listed as endangered with future heatwaves considered the greatest threat to its survival. In this study, we investigated long-­term climatic trends for Cairns, paying particular attention to the frequency of extreme heat events from 1943 to 2022. We then characterized the microclimate of urban flying-­fox roosts during the Austral summers of 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 across Cairns to assess the long-­term feasibility of urban spectacled flying-­fox roosts. From the long-­term climate records, we observed an overall increase in Cairns' average annual temperature of 1.3°C from 1943 to 2022 and an increase in the number of excessively hot days per decade, from 16 in the first decade (1943–1952) to 67 in the last (2013–2022). We regularly detected maximum roost temperatures of 30–35°C during our study, with excessively hot days (>35°C) recorded more frequently than expected compared to Cairns's maximum temperatures from the last decade (2013–2023). We detected only 1 day where roost temperatures exceeded 40°C and no period that replicated the 2018 heatwave conditions. Furthermore, we found a significant negative relationship between roost ambient temperature and humidity, where the hottest days also coincided with those with the lowest humidity. Importantly, we found no difference in microclimate between roosts that were occupied and unoccupied by flying-­foxes during our study, suggesting that other environmental or behavioural factors are more influential for roost selection than the roosting microclimate. Ensuring the long-­term conservation of spectacled flying-­foxes under a changing climate will require the management of urban roosts to increase their thermal resistance to heatwaves, and more research is needed to identify the variables modulating this aspect.",

To further knowledge of bat parasitology, pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus) were acquired from across the Greater Manchester and Lancashire region of England and examined for gastrointestinal helminths using morphological and molecular analyses†. Sixty-eight of 90 adult/juvenile bats (76% prevalence) were infected with at least 1 species of helminth and mean helminth abundance was 48·2 (+ / − 7·0). All helminths were digenean trematodes and the following species were identiﬁed in 51 P. pipistrellus specimens (prevalence in parentheses): Lecithodendrium linstowi (80·4%), L. spathulatum (19·6%), Prosthodendrium sp. (35·3%), Plagiorchis koreanus (29·4%) and Pycnoporus heteroporus (9·8%). Statistical analyses, incorporating multifactorial models, showed that male bats exhibited a signiﬁcantly more aggregated helminth distribution and lower abundance than females. Positive associations were observed between L. linstowi and L. spathulatum, Prosthodendrium sp. and P. heteroporus and between L. spathulatum and P. koreanus. A revised phylogeny of bat-associated Lecithodendriidae, incorporating novel L. spathulatum and Prosthodendrium sp. 28S rRNA sequences, separated the controversial clade formed by L. linstowi and P. hurkovaae. Further studies are likely to assist the understanding of bat-parasite/pathogen relationships, helminth infracommunity structures and phylogenetics.",
