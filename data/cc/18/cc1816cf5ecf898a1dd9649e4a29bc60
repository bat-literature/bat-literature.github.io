            "abstractNote": "This chapter discusses dendritic cells (DCs). Surrogate markers to measure adaptive T cell immunity include cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, cytokine production by T lymphocytes and more recently, antigen-specific T lymphocytes determined by tetramer/monomer technology. However, T lymphocyte responses are dependent on antigen-presenting cells, notably dendritic cells (DC), which in their various forms are shown to initiate and direct T lymphocyte responses. DC contributes to B lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell responses as well. Thus, fundamental to the complete measurement of immunity is the ability to accurately assess DC numbers and function along with other effector cells. Wherever possible, available functional DC data are correlated with absolute DC count data. DC counting and DC function are predicted to become clinically relevant biomarkers that correlate with clinical responses. The chapter discusses the tools that can be used for DC counting. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "Recently there has been a growing concern that many published research findings do not hold up in attempts to replicate them. We argue that this problem may originate from a culture of â€˜you can publish if you found a significant effectâ€™. This culture creates a systematic bias against the null hypothesis which renders meta-analyses questionable and may even lead to a situation where hypotheses become difficult to falsify. In order to pinpoint the sources of error and possible solutions, we review current scientific practices with regard to their effect on the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion. We explain why the proportion of published false-positive findings is expected to increase with (i) decreasing sample size, (ii) increasing pursuit of novelty, (iii) various forms of multiple testing and researcher flexibility, and (iv) incorrect P-values, especially due to unaccounted pseudoreplication, i.e. the non-independence of data points (clustered data). We provide examples showing how statistical pitfalls and psychological traps lead to conclusions that are biased and unreliable, and we show how these mistakes can be avoided. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to a culture of â€˜you can publish if your study is rigorousâ€™. To this end, we highlight promising strategies towards making science more objective. Specifically, we enthusiastically encourage scientists to preregister their studies (including a priori hypotheses and complete analysis plans), to blind observers to treatment groups during data collection and analysis, and unconditionally to report all results. Also, we advocate reallocating some efforts away from seeking novelty and discovery and towards replicating important research findings of one's own and of others for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole. We believe these efforts will be aided by a shift in evaluation criteria away from the current system which values metrics of â€˜impactâ€™ almost exclusively and towards a system which explicitly values indices of scientific rigour.",

            "abstractNote": "One of the main mechanisms of inducing an antiviral response depends on 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS), which sense double-stranded RNA in the cytoplasm and activate RNase L. Mutations leading to the loss of functional OAS1 and OAS2 genes have been identified as important modifiers of the human immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we performed comparative genomics to search for inactivating mutations of OAS genes in other species of mammals and to establish a model for the diversifying evolution of the OAS gene family. We found that a recombination of the OAS and OAS-like (OASL) loci has led to the loss of OAS2 in camelids, which also lack OAS3. Both paralogs of OASL and OAS3 are absent in Asian pangolins. An evolutionarily ancient OAS paralog, which we tentatively name OAS4, has been lost in pangolins, bats and humans. A previously unknown OAS gene, tentatively named OAS5, is present in Yangochiroptera, a suborder of bats. These differences in the OAS gene repertoire may affect innate immune responses to coronaviruses and other RNA viruses.",

Bats have provided the most diverse assemblages of coronaviruses, suggesting that they may be the natural reservoir. Continued virological surveillance has proven to be the best way to avert this infectious disease at the source. Here we provide the first description of a previously unidentified coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during virological surveillance in southern China. Partial genome analysis revealed a typical coronavirus genome but with a unique putative accessory gene organization. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, of these novel coronaviruses were most closely related to those of group 3 coronaviruses identified from birds, while the spike protein gene was most closely related to that of group 1 coronaviruses from mammals. However, these viruses always fell into an outgroup phylogenetic relationship with respect to other coronaviruses and had low amino acid similarity to all known coronavirus groups, indicating that they diverged early in the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. These results suggest that these viruses may represent a previously unrecognized evolutionary pathway, or possibly an unidentified coronavirus group. This study demonstrates the importance of systematic virological surveillance in market animals for understanding the evolution and emergence of viruses with infectious potential.",

            "abstractNote": "The polytypic Angola colobus Colobus angolensis is a widespread species that, in eastern Africa, is often restricted to small, highly isolated, areas. In 1966, evidence for an undescribed subspecies of C. angolensis was obtained in Mahale Mountains National Park, central west Tanzania. Mahale C. angolensis has only been observed twice by scientists (1976 and 1979) and remained unnamed. In April 2022, 43 years after the last published observation, we observed, heard, and photographed a group of Mahale C. angolensis. Given the considerable current geographic isolation (~100 km across L. Tanganyika; ~330 km across land) of this monkey from its conspecifics, together with the distinctive coloration and pattern of its pelage, we here designate this as a new subspecies. We also describe the environment in which Mahale C. angolensis lives, discuss its paleobiogeography, taxonomic arrangement, and threats, and provide recommendations for conservation and research. Mahale C. angolensis is endemic to the montane forests of Mahale Mountains National Park where it has been observed at only two sites, the south slope of Mt. Ihumo (~1,970 m asl) and on the ridge between Mt. Nkungwe and Mt. Kahoko (~2,350 m asl). In addition, bouts of 'roar' loud calls were heard on nearby Mt. Mhensabantu (~2,050 m asl) on two occasions. The geographic distribution of Mahale C. angolensis is likely between 10 km² and 50 km². The size of this population is probably <400 individuals, with <200 adults. This monkey appears to occur wholly within a remote and rugged part of Mahale Mountains National Park where agricultural encroachment and poaching are not major concerns at this time. The primary threats are habitat loss due to fire, and to a warming climate. With its small population and severely restricted geographic distribution, Mahale C. angolensis qualifies as a 'Critically Endangered' subspecies under current IUCN Red List degree of threat criteria.",

            "abstractNote": "Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasomes are a key part of the anti-viral innate immune system as they detect conserved viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). A successful host response to viral infections critically depend on the initial activation of PRRs by viruses, mainly by viral DNA and RNA. The signalling pathways activated by PRRs leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, to recruit immune cells, and type I and type III interferons which leads to the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISG), powerful virus restriction factors that establish the “antiviral state”. Inflammasomes contribute to anti-viral responses through the maturation of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 and through triggering pyroptotic cell death. The activity of the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune response normally leads to successful virus elimination, although disproportionate innate responses contribute to viral pathology. In this review we will discuss recent insights into the influence of PRR activation and inflammasomes on viral infections and what this means for the mammalian host. We will also comment on how specific PRRs and inflammasomes may be relevant to how SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, interacts with host innate immunity.",

            "abstractNote": "Some nonhuman animals form adaptive long-term cooperative relationships with nonkin that seem analogous in form and function to human friendship [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, it remains unclear how these bonds initially form, especially when they entail investments of time and energy. Theory suggests individuals can reduce the risk of exploitation by initially spreading out smaller cooperative investments across time [e.g., 5] or partners [6], then gradually escalating investments in more cooperative partnerships [7]. Despite its intuitive appeal, this raising-the-stakes model [7] has gained surprisingly scarce empirical support. Although human strangers do “raise the stakes” when making bids in cooperation games [8], there has been no clear evidence for raising the stakes during formation of social bonds in nature. Existing studies are limited to cooperative interactions with severe power asymmetries (e.g., the cleaner-client fish mutualism [9]) or snapshots of a single behavior within established relationships (grooming in primates [10, 11, 12, 13]). Raising the stakes during relationship formation might involve escalating to more costly behaviors. For example, individuals could “test the waters” by first clustering for warmth (no cost), then conditionally grooming (low cost), and eventually providing coalitionary support (high cost). Detecting such a pattern requires introducing random strangers and measuring the emergence of natural helping behaviors that vary in costs. We performed this test by tracking the emergence of social grooming and regurgitated food donations among previously unfamiliar captive vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) over 15 months. We found compelling evidence that vampire bats selectively escalate low-cost grooming before developing higher-cost food-sharing relationships.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Foamy viruses are exogenous retroviruses that are highly endemic in non-human primates (NHPs). Recent studies, mainly performed in North America, indicated frequent simian foamy virus (SFV) infection in persons occupationally exposed to NHPs. This zoonotic infection was demonstrated mainly after bites by chimpanzees [Pan troglodytes (P. t.)] of the West African P. t. verus subspecies in primatology centers or zoos in the USA. METHODS: We studied 32 chimpanzees from the Central African subspecies P. t. troglodytes and P. t. vellerosus, originating from Cameroon (29 cases) or Gabon (3 cases). We screened first plasma or sera of the animals with a Western blot detecting the SFVs Gag doublet proteins. Then, we performed two nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) amplifying a fragment of the integrase and LTR regions and, finally, we made phylogenetical analyses on the sequences obtained from the integrase PCR products. RESULTS: By serological and/or molecular assays, we detected foamy viruses (FVs) infection in 14 chimpanzees. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses of a 425 bp fragment of the integrase gene obtained for 10 of the 14 positive apes, demonstrated a wide diversity of new FVs strains that belong phylogenetically either to the P. t. troglodytes or P. t. vellerosus foamy viral clade. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that chimpanzees living in these areas of Central Africa are infected by several specific foamy viruses. This raises, in such regions, the potential risk of a human retroviral infection of zoonotic origin linked to chimpanzees contacts, as already exemplified for STLV-1 and SIV infections.",

Florida has indigenous non-migratory populations of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) that mostly roost in colonies in artificial structures. Unlike their counterparts in Brazil and Mexico, the viruses harbored by the Florida bats have been underexplored. We report the detection of an alphacoronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequence in the feces of two of 19 different T. brasiliensis that were capture/release bats that had been evaluated for overall health. The RdRp sequence is similar but not identical to previously detected sequences in the feces of two different species of bats (T. brasiliensis and Molossus molossus) in Brazil. In common with the experience of others doing similar work, attempts to isolate the virus in cell cultures were unsuccessful. We surmise that this and highly related alphacoronavirus are carried by Brazilian free-tailed bats living in a wide eco-spatial region. As various coronaviruses (CoVs) that affect humans emerged from bats, our study raises the question whether CoVs such as the one detected in our work are yet-to-be-detected pathogens of humans and animals other than bats.",

In contrast, Reston virus (RESTV) is apparently apathogenic in humans, and while transmission of RESTV from domestic pigs to people results in seroconversion, no signs of disease have been reported in such cases. The determinants leading to these differences in pathogenicity are not well understood, but such information is needed in order to better evaluate the risks posed by the repeated spillover of RESTV into the human population and to perform risk assessments for newly emerging filoviruses with unknown pathogenic potential. Interestingly, RESTV and EBOV already show marked differences in their growth in vitro, with RESTV growing slower and reaching lower end titers. In order to understand the basis for this in vitro attenuation of RESTV, we used various life cycle modeling systems mimicking different aspects of the virus life cycle. Our results showed that viral RNA synthesis was markedly slower when using the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) components from RESTV, rather than those for EBOV. In contrast, the kinetics of budding and entry were indistinguishable between these two viruses. These data contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis for filovirus pathogenicity by showing that it is primarily differences in the robustness of RNA synthesis by the viral RNP complex that are responsible for the impaired growth of RESTV in tissue culture.",

Over a human's life span, keratinized skin cells, immune cells, and microbes all interact to integrate the processes of maintaining skin's physical and immune barrier under homeostatic healthy conditions and also under multiple stresses, such as wounding or infection. In this Review, we explore the intricate interactions of microbes and immune cells on the skin surface and within associated appendages to regulate this orchestrated maturation in the context of both host physiological changes and environmental challenges.",

In order to further investigate the relationship between HIV-2 and SIVsm, the SIV specific to the SM, we characterized seven new SIVsm strains from SMs sold in Sierra Leone markets as bush meat. The gag, pol, and env sequences showed that, while the viruses of all seven SMs belonged to the SIVsm-HIV-2 lineage, they were highly divergent viruses, in spite of the fact that most of the samples originated from the same geographical region. They clustered in three lineages, two of which have been previously reported. Two of the new SIVsm strains clustered differently in gag and env phylogenetic trees, suggesting SIVsm recombination that had occurred in the past. In spite of the fact that our study doubles the number of known SIVsm strains from wild SMs, none of the simian strains were close to the groups in which HIV-2 was epidemic (groups A and B).",

            "abstractNote": "Pangolins, or scaly anteaters, have recently been flagshiped as one of the most illegally traded mammals, and as a corollary, as potential intermediate hosts at the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to improve the traceability of their trade, we developed 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci for the white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), the species most frequently found on African bushmeat markets. We genotyped 24 white-bellied pangolins from the Douala market, Cameroon, originating from the Ebo forest c. 75 km north-east of Douala. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 12 (mean = 6.95), and mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.592 (0.208-0.875) and 0.671 (0.469-0.836), respectively. Genetic diversity was higher than that cross-estimated from microsatellite loci developed for other species of pangolins. Two loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and two loci showed linkage disequilibrium. Genetic variance (PCoA) was increased with the addition of 13 pangolins of unknown origin, possibly suggesting that the Douala market is fed from differentiated source populations of white-bellied pangolins. Each of the 37 individuals had a unique multilocus genotype. The unbiased probability of identity (uPI) and the probability of identity among siblings (PIsibs) were both very low (uPI = 8.443 e-21; PIsibs = 1.011 e-07). Only five microsatellite loci were needed to reach the conservative value of PIsibs < 0.01, overall indicating a powerful discriminating power of our combined loci. These 20 newly developed microsatellite loci might prove useful in tracing the local-to-global trade of the white-bellied pangolin, and will hopefully contribute to the DNA-assisted implementation of future conservation strategies at reasonable costs.",
