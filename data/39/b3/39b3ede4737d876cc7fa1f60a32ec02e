Here, we investigated the seasonal effects of olive grove intensification at both local (farming practices and grove structural complexity) and landscape scale (land-cover diversity) on birds and bats, at species and community-level. Both groups were surveyed during spring, summer, and autumn in 60 sites representing varying levels of olive grove intensification throughout the Alentejo region (southern Portugal). At the local scale, the number of chemical applications was used as a proxy for the intensification of farming practices and a Structural Index, which accounted for within-grove variability in tree density and features, was used as a measure of grove structural complexity. At landscape scale, we quantified the proportion of the major land-cover types potentially affecting birds and bats. We found that the abundance of ca. 77% of the species analyzed (ca. 84% and 55% of birds and bats respectively) was negatively related to olive grove intensification in at least one season. The Structural Index was the most influential factor at both species and community-levels, especially for birds, with a consistent and strong effect across seasons. Chemical applications had a stronger negative effect on birds, whereas the amount of olive grove cover had a stronger detrimental effect on bats. Birds and bats showed a variable response to predictor variables depending on the season, particularly for the bat community. Our study shows differences in bird and bat responses associated with the spatio-temporal variability of the agricultural intensification components. On the one hand, birds and bats showed a seasonal pattern of association with the different components of olive grove intensification, probably due to their ecological and biological requirements. On the other hand, the responses of both groups also appear to be scale-dependent: while birds seem to respond to in-farm or local intensification more strongly, bats seem to be more influenced by landscape-scale simplification. Overall, we highlight the importance of the structural complexity of olive groves for birds and bats, an aspect that should be considered in the design of agricultural policies aiming to promote biodiversity conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Landscape and biophysical determinants of insectivorous bat activity and community composition in space and time are central to understanding how growers can maximise bat-mediated pest control services in crops. We measured community composition, abundance, richness and foraging attempts of insectivorous bats in the centre of dryland cotton crops using acoustic sampling. We examined how bat activity was related to woody vegetation in the surrounding landscape, prey insect abundance, distance to crop edge, size of ﬁeld, proximity to waterbodies and moon illumination to better understand insectivorous bat diversity and foraging in crop interiors. We collected a total of 9467 acoustic ﬁles including 1198 foraging attempts (feeding buzzes) of at least 21 insectivorous bat species. The bat assemblage in cotton crop interiors (richness and diversity) was positively related to woody vegetation foliage cover within 5–10 km of the crop, as well as Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera abundance, but was negatively related to distance from the ﬁeld edge into the crop and moon illumination. Increased feeding attempts were linked to increased Lepidoptera and Hemiptera on nights of high moon illumination (> 75 %). Bat activity and foraging was also higher during nights of increased insect abundance, particularly Lepidoptera, indicating that bats track food resources. Our results highlight the importance of managing bat roosting habitat at diﬀerent landscape scales to enhance bat diversity and foraging in crop interiors and thus insect consumption. Given the high bat feeding activity on nights of high moon illumination and increased Hemiptera abundance, the timing of insecticide sprays to target pests, such as Hemipteran sucking bugs, could be scheduled on nights of low moon illumination. Such information is useful in identifying conservation priorities for the management of bats in intensively farmed agroecosystems and should facilitate habitat management by growers to maximise crop pest protection services in crop interiors.",

The goal of the study was to assess the principal factors inﬂuencing the activity and species richness of insectivorous bats in a semi-arid Mediterranean agroecosystem. We hypothesized that bat activity and species richness are inﬂuenced by the anthropogenic factors that are typical of agroecosystems, such as fragmentation of the landscape and loss of natural habitat, agrochemical use, presence of powerlines and roads, and proximity to urban areas. We recorded bats in a diversiﬁed semi-arid Mediterranean agroecosystem in 2012 and 2013 and estimated the eﬀect of various anthropogenic and environmental factors on their activity. The proportion of natural and semi-natural habitats at the landscape and at the plot scale were the most important predictors of total bat activity, and of the activity the two most common species recorded, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Tadarida teniotis, both known to be synanthropic. Indeed, P. kuhlii had a positive association with the proximity to bodies of water and to settlements. Total bat activity was negatively associated with the use of agrochemicals. Thus, in line with our predictions, both the proportion of natural land cover in the environment and the use of agrochemicals play an important role in determining bat distribution in agricultural environments. Ecological inferences based on our results can be used to develop management schemes, such as restoring patches of natural vegetation near and within farmlands, to increase the suitability of agroecosystems as habitats for insectivorous bats. These could contribute both to the protection of endangered bat species and to bio-control of insect pests.",

We present a baseline survey and describe the patterns of roadkill in the Tarangire–Manyara ecosystem of Tanzania. A 75 km stretch of the Arusha Highway that passes adjacent to Manyara Ranch and Lake Manyara National Park was studied for 10 consecutive days in November 2013 (the rainy season). Wildlife species killed on the road, roadkill frequency and road characteristics were determined. A total of 101 roadkill were recorded (0.13 roadkill km−1) comprising 37 species from all terrestrial vertebrate groups, of which two species, house cat (Felis catus) and domestic dog (Canis lupus), were domesticated species. Birds were the most frequently killed taxon (50%), followed by mammals (30%), reptiles (17%) and amphibians (3%). Excluding birds, roadkill primarily consisted of nocturnal species (65%) versus diurnal species (35%). Most roadkill (77.3%) were encountered on road stretches adjacent to protected areas of Manyara Ranch and Lake Manyara National Park compared with 22.7% on the road stretches adjacent to non-protected areas. These findings highlight that roads are a potential threat to wildlife in East Africa and serve as a baseline for future comparisons.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Biodiversity in tropical rainforests is heavily influenced by land use/cover change (LUCC), but so far there have been few LUCC studies conducted in Africa. We present several methods that make use of remotely sensed data and landscape metrics and allow for assessment of the development of land cover and thus forest fragmentation and disturbance over a substantial period of time. The study covers Kakamega Forest and its associated forest areas in western Kenya, over the last 30 years. The accuracy of a supervised multispectral classification of Landsat time series data encompassing seven time steps between 1972 and 2001 is numerically assessed using ground truth reference data considering the 2001 time step. Here, buffering the forest areas by 1 km, highest user's accuracies for the forest classes ‘near natural + old secondary forest’ (87.50%), ‘secondary forest’ (80.00%) and ‘bushland/shrubs’ (81.08%) are revealed. Images of a spatially distributed fragmentation index derived from the land cover time series by applying a three by 3 pixel‐sized moving window to determine forest pixels’ adjacency, highlight trends in forest fragmentation, e.g. the splitting into two separate forests along the Yala/Ikuywa corridor. Calculations of mean fragmentation indices for the Biodiversity Monitoring Transect Analysis in Eastern Africa (BIOTA‐East Africa) focus research areas are used to evaluate the fragmentation index and to demonstrate its potential to extrapolate (e.g. biological) field findings in space and time. Here we argue for a correlation of the fragmentation indices results not only with forest management regimes, but with population distribution and accessibility (e.g. by roads). A cluster analysis applying the isodata‐algorithm on the classification results of all seven times steps allows for a rapid visual assessment of the distinct pattern of typical land cover development trends since 1972. This reveals that parts of Kakamega Forest have experienced severe forest loss while others, especially in the north‐east, show signs of succession.\n          , \n            Résumé\n            \n              La biodiversité des forêts pluviales tropicales est fort influencée par les changements d'utilisation et de couverture du sol (\n              land use/cover change\n              – LUCC), mais il y a eu jusqu’à présent fort peu d’études des LUCC en Afrique. Nous présentons plusieurs méthodes qui utilisent des données de télédétection et d’écologie spatiale et permettent d’évaluer le développement du couvert forestier et donc de la fragmentation et des perturbations durant une période substantielle. L’étude concerne la forêt de Kakamega et toute les zones forestières qui lui sont associées dans l'ouest du Kenya, au cours des 30 dernières années. L'exactitude d'une classification multispectrale de données sur des séries temporelles Landsat, qui regroupent sept étapes chronologiques entre 1972 et 2001, est évaluée numériquement en utilisant les données réelles de «vérité terrain» correspondant à l’étape de 2001. En quadrillant la forêt en unités d'un km de côté, l'utilisateur obtient les plus grandes précisions pour les classes de forêts «presque naturelle + ancienne forêt secondaire» (87,50%), «forêts secondaires» (80,00%) et «Brousse/buissons» (81,08%). Des images de l'index de fragmentation spatialement distribué, dérivées de séries temporelles de la couverture du sol en appliquant une fenêtre glissante de trois pixels sur trois pour déterminer l'adjacence des pixels, mettent en évidence les tendances de la fragmentation de la forêt, par exemple la séparation en deux forêts séparées le long du corridor Yala/Ikuywa. Les calculs des indices de fragmentation moyens pour les zones centrales de recherche de BIOTA‐est servent àévaluer l'indice de fragmentation et à démontrer son potentiel pour extrapoler des découvertes (ex. biologiques) de terrain dans l'espace et le temps. Nous défendons ici une corrélation des résultats des indices de fragmentation non seulement avec les régimes de gestion forestière, mais aussi avec la distribution de la population et l'accessibilité (routes). Une analyse d'ensemble appliquant l'algorithme de seuillage aux résultats de l'application des sept étapes permet une évaluation visuelle rapide du pattern distinct des tendances typiques du développement de la couverture végétale depuis 1972. Ceci révèle que des parties de la forêt de Kakamega ont connu de graves pertes forestières alors que d'autres, spécialement au nord‐est, présentent des signes de succession.",

            "abstractNote": "Deforestation causes fragmentation of habitats, which in turn affects the composition, abundance and demography of species, and therefore the population isolation of many species. The impacts of fragmentation will depend on the responsiveness of the species to disturbances in their habitat, and the configuration and structure of landscape. In some populations, habitat fragmentation can cause long-term population isolation by the reduction in population size and the weakening of relations between individuals, even in highly mobile species like bats. In Mexico, A. jamaicensis is the most studied bat; however, few studies focused on the knowledge of the impacts of habitat modification in its diversity and genetic structure. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity, structure and genetic differentiation, and analyze demographic history of A. jamaicensis in two different habitats, using a 396 bp fragment of the mitochondrial Dloop region. Haplotype network revealed 34 unique haplotypes of 34 individuals analyzed. Haplotype diversity was high (h = 1) for both populations, and nucleotide diversity was relatively low (< 0.03). The analysis of the distribution of pairwise differences between sequences and negative values of statistical tests based on neutrality suggest a process of recent and sudden demographic expansion of A. jamaicensis. A moderate genetic differentiation points to the existence of genetic structure of A. jamaicensis.",

In the context of previous studies, we managed to create and keep a wide collection of cell lines from European bat species. Liver cells were chosen for testing, as they represent the preferred model for toxicological studies. Bats are protected, cell lines replacing experimental animals thus represent a unique opportunity to examine effects of pollutants which animals are exposed to in their environments. Moreover, cell incubation temperature variation may simulate physiological states of heterothermic bats. Liver cell lines were cultivated to the required cell number. Exposure to five different concentrations of permethrin (PM) and imidacloprid (IMI) were used to determine cytotoxic effects of these pesticides on Nyctalus noctula-derived liver cells cultivated at 37 °C and 8 °C for 24 h. An assay based on the measurement of activity of lactate dehydrogenase released from damaged cells was used for quantitating cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity of IMI ranged from 0% to 47% and from 56% to 67% at 37 °C and 8 °C, respectively. Cytotoxicity of PM ranged from 36% to 56% and from 43% to 88% at 37 °C and 8 °C, respectively. Permethrin was tested on the cells at an order of magnitude lower concentrations; even so, higher degree of cytotoxicity was recorded. Imidacloprid was more toxic to bat liver cells at a hibernation temperature than at body temperature of 37 °C.",

Based on morphological characteristics as well as on partial COI and 16S rDNA gene sequences the tick was identified as an engorged female of Ixodes ariadnae. The greater mouseeared bat is a new host record for this tick species. Taking into account the geographical position of the collection site and the known migration distance of the greater mouse-eared bat, the present data suggest the autochthonous occurrence of I. ariadnae in Germany. This is the first record of I. ariadnae in Germany, and in any country other than Hungary, where this species has been recently discovered.",

As such, research on bat trypanosomes has been focused on South America, where Chagas disease is a serious issue. While the majority of European studies have been performed in the United Kingdom, there is virtually no data available for Eastern and Central parts of Europe. To address this, the present study aims to identify and assess the prevalence and pathogenicity of trypanosomes in bats sampled in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Poland. Blood collected from 381 adult bats of eight species was tested for presence of trypanosomes using nested polymerase chain reactions. To assess possible impacts of trypanosome parasites on the health status of their hosts, haematological and biochemical analyses were performed for 56 greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) emerging from hibernacula and 36 females of the same species from summer colonies. The overall prevalence of the two trypanosome species detected (T. dionisii and T. vespertilionis) was 27%, with a significantly higher prevalence in the Czech Republic compared to the other countries studied. Significant differences in bat trypanosome prevalence in different European countries appear to be connected with presence or absence of possible vectors in summer roosts. No impact of trypanosomes on haematology and blood chemistry parameters was detected in Trypanosoma-positive greater mouse-eared bats. Though T. dionisii infection in bats appears asymptomatic, long-term health consequences still need to be studied in greater detail.",

We aimed to analyze the occurrence of trypanosomatid species in bats occurring in remnants of gallery forests of Brasília, Federal District of Brazil. We sampled bats using mist nets in six sites, and we collected blood, wing fragments and oral swab samples from all captured individuals. Trypanosomatids were identiﬁed in the captured bats through sequencing of the SSUrRNA region and kDNA qPCR. We found no parasite in blood smears of 146 individuals of 14 species captured, but blood cultures were positive for nine bats. We detected trypanosomatids molecularly in 111 (76%) specimens of all bat species in the studied areas. Most of the infected bats had Leishmania-like DNA detected in blood and swab samples of the oral mucosa. We distinguished three species of Trypanosoma (Trypanosoma dionisii, T. rangeli and T. cruzi) in Carollia perspicillata. SSUrRNA PCR of oral samples is a non-invasive and practical method for identiﬁcation of trypanosomatid species in bats. Our results support our belief that bats could be potential reservoirs for Trypanosoma and Leishmania-like species in the enzootic cycle of these parasites in gallery forests of the Brazilian Cerrado biome.",

We studied the echolocation behaviors of an ecologically poorly known bat species, Myotis macrodactylus, while they were commuting in three types of habitats differing significantly in the amount of background clutter, as well as searching for prey above the water surface in a river. Results showed that M. macrodactylus altered their echolocation call structure in the same way during commuting as foraging bats do in relation to the changing level of clutter. With increasing level of clutter, M. macrodactylus generally produced echolocation calls with higher start, end, and peak frequencies; wider bandwidth; and shorter pulse duration. Compared to commuting, bats emitted significantly lower frequency calls with narrower bandwidth while searching for prey. Discriminant function analysis indicated that 79.8% of the calls from the three commuting habitats were correctly grouped, and 87% of the calls were correctly classified to the commuting and foraging contexts. Our finding has implications for those who would identify species by their calls.",

Morphological changes indicated that body mass and length of forearm followed a linear pattern of growth until 13 days of age at mean growth rates of 0.14 g/day and 1.08 mm/day, respectively, and thereafter, growth rates slowed. The length of the total epiphyseal gap of the fourth metacarpal–phalangeal joint showed a linear increase for up to 10 days, followed by a linear decrease until day 40 at a mean rate of 0.09 mm/day. Together, two equations permitted estimation of the age of H. pomona pups between 1 and 40 days. The logistic equation provided the best fit to the empirical curves for body mass and length of forearm. Studies of vocal development showed that the precursors of echolocation calls were not emitted until day 7 after birth. As the pups grew, the dominant frequency (DF) of isolation calls increased and number of harmonics (NH) decreased, whereas the duration remained relatively stable. The DF and BFM2 (the bandwidth of the terminal frequencymodulated sweep from the second harmonic) of the early echolocation calls increased; however, the NH and duration decreased.",

            "abstractNote": "Background  Two new species of chiggers in the two genera (Chiroptella Vercammen-Grandjean, 1960 and Rudnicula Vercammen-Grandjean, 1964) have been described in Indonesia since 2020. The checklist of all known bat-infesting chiggers has also been compiled for Indonesia. It summarizes 16 species in 9 genera of chiggers parasitizing 12 bat species belonging to 5 families collected on 8 Indonesian islands. Nine specimens collected in 2020 on Nusa Penida Island were not included in the checklist because of their uncertain taxonomy. In the current paper, we resolve the taxonomy of these specimens belonging to Trombicula sensu stricto group. We also revise the existing characters of this group and provide new characters helping with the clear definition of this taxa.\nMethods  Hosts and chiggers were captured in February 2020 in Nusa Penida Islands in Indonesia using standard bat-capturing and parasite-collecting methods. For the specimens examined in this study were provided drawings, measurements, and microscopy images. This type material is deposited in the Slovak and Czech National museums.\nResults  In the paper, we describe a new species parasitizing diadem leaf-nosed bat in the Goa Peteng cave on Nusa Penida Island (Lesser Sunda Islands, East Indonesia). This new species differs from all related species by the presence of a very long tarsala I ­(S1). A key to the larvae of all seven known Trombicula s. s. species is provided. The differentiation of Trombicula s. s. group is based on leg segmentation fsp = 6.6.6, rugose scutum with complete AM, AL and PL setation, and fT = 5B, 5BN or 4B2N.\nConclusion  A new species within the genus Trombicula, group minor has been described. The new species also increases the number of known chiggers in Indonesia and the number of species parasitizing the host species Hipposideros diadema. Trombicula s. s. has also been revised and more clearly defined.",

            "abstractNote": "Purpose  Neotropical bats are infested by multiple ectoparasites (like bat fly and mite species) and investigations on these invertebrates on their hosts are crucial to better understand the ectoparasite-ectoparasite and ectoparasite-host associations. The goal of this study was to report ectoparasites species (bat flies and mites) on bats, emphasizing ectoparasite co-occurrences and host-ectoparasite associations. We also test if there is relationship between bat flies and mites on their hosts.\nMethods  This study occurred twice a month from September 2011 to September 2012 in an Atlantic Forest remnant in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Spearman correlation was used to test relationship between bat flies and mites.\nResults  We found 27 species of ectoparasites on 13 species of bats. Ectoparasites belonged to the bat fly families Streblidae and Nycteribiidae, and the mite families Spinturnicidae, Macronyssidae, Sarcoptidae, and Trombiculidae. Streblid-streblid association was more frequent, but we also recorded streblid-spinturnicid, streblid-sarcoptid and spinturnicid-spinturnicid associations. The abundance of spinturnicid species was negatively related to the abundance of streblid species. We record the first occurrence of Strebla chrotopteri associated with Chrotopterus auritus, Periglischrus paracutisternus associated with Trachops cirrhosus and Basilia juquiensis associated with Myotis riparius for Rio de Janeiro State.\nConclusion  There were several co-occurrences between different taxa and between species of the same family. These results show the importance of the integrated taxonomic record. The negative interspecific interactions between spinturnicid and streblid may affect distributions, structuring ectoparasite communities on hosts.",

For pipistrelle bats, such environments are essential and so those species living in sympatry have to develop mechanisms of niche partitioning to avoid direct competition. We used ecological niche models and habitat suitability maps (HSMs) to study the ecological requirements and possible interspeciﬁc interactions between three sympatric species of pipistrelles in semiarid Mediterranean landscapes. The results point to differences between the three species: Pipistrellus kuhlii has the largest proportion of optimal habitat (despite being the least common), Pipistrellus pygmaeus has the highest value of marginality and the most common, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, is a habitattolerant and generalist species. However, all three species show a strong preference for aquatic habitats and there is a high degree of overlapping between them, so that their coexistence must obey ﬁne-scale mechanisms of niche partitioning. The profound alterations that have occurred in Mediterranean ecosystems as a result of substantial changes in the landscape uses (intensive agriculture and urbanization) may favour P. pipistrellus and be detrimental to the other two species, especially P. kuhlii.",

The tongues of nine adult individuals of each species were utilized in our investigation. The tongue of fruit-eating bat was observed relatively longer than the one of insect-eating bat. Grossly, the insect-eating bat had a lingual prominence on the dorsum of lingual body, while the fruit-eating bat had a concave midline over the lingual body. Histologically, numerous forms of lingual papillae were scattered along the dorsal epithelium of the tongue. The lingual papillae of the fruit-eating bat seem to be well adapted for piercing the skin of a fruit and liquid sap retention. The lingual glands of both species were lodged in the muscular layer. Two main sets were identiﬁed; the serous von Ebner's gland usually seen accompanied by the circumvallate papillae and Weber's gland with mixed mucoserous secretions. Von Ebner's gland showed more prominent acidic mucins, while Weber's gland expressed neutral mucins. The lingual epithelium of the fruit-eating bat had an outer covering of corniﬁed non-nucleated epithelium. On the other hand, the insect-eating bat had an outer covering of nucleated epithelium. It is for the ﬁrst time to record the existence of the entoglossal plates of both species which consisted of a bony core in the fruiteating bat and a cartilaginous element in the insect-eating bat. The current study represents an attempt to shed more light on the tongue evolution among mammalian vertebrates.",

In this study, we report an unusual interaction between a bat and a cockroach in the Grutas de Martínez de la Torre cave system in Oaxaca, Mexico. While cave cockroaches are known to feed on bat pups falling down to the ground, and some species of insectivorous bats prey on cockroaches, this interaction was different. A small lesser naked-backed bat (Pteronotus fulvus) was captured with a lesion on its back, which was caused by a cockroach (Nyctantonina azteca) who created a large cavity between the patagium and epidermal epithelium tissue where it was found. The cockroach showed injuries on its left side, including its tegmina, legs II and III, and antenna. The wounds on both organisms were not recent, indicating that this interaction had been going on for some time. If we had not detected this event, it is likely that this relationship would have persisted until one of them died. The observed interaction is difficult to categorize, however we evaluated two hypotheses; one being predation and the other parasitism. From our analysis of data presented in this paper we found support for an opportunistic case of parasitism, in which N. azteca persisted underneath the wing membrane of P. fulvus. Biotic relationships between bats and cockroaches in cave ecosystems are complex and have the potential for unexpected species interactions.",

            "abstractNote": "The study of host-parasite interactions is key to understanding ecological interactions since parasites play a crucial role in the regulation of populations of host species. The families Nycteribiidae and Streblidae (Diptera: Hippoboscoidea) are ectoparasitic flies specific to bats, which have evolved adaptations to their host. The host-parasite interactions are formed by coevolutionary processes and illustrate the current and historical associations between the species involved. For this reason, the use of ecological networks in parasite-host interactions allows us to elucidate how the structure of their interactions respond to biotic and abiotic factors. In the present study, we evaluated changes in the fly-bat interaction networks in two contrasting landscapes in the Department of Arauca of the Colombian Orinoquia Region. The first landscape is composed of savannas and alluvial forests and the second with anthropogenic disturbances composed of cocoa crops, livestock areas and human settlements. We used mist nets to capture bats and collect their respective parasitic flies. Using this data, we built a bipartite interaction network for each landscape, and we calculated the main metrics of each network. 19.8% of the 524 bats captured presented ectoparasitic flies, with a total of 326 flies belonging to nine genera of Streblidae and one genus of Nycteribiidae. The diversity and prevalence of ectoparasitic flies of bats was higher for the disturbed landscape in contrast to savannas and forests. The networks of both landscapes were characterized by being highly specialized and modular. Nonetheless, the network obtained in the savannas and alluvial forests showed greater specialization, and the landscape with anthropogenic impact presented greater modularity. Our results confirm the high specialization and modularity that characterizes the ectoparasitic bat-fly antagonistic network. Also, we provided new observations suggesting that a degraded landscape may affect the bat hosts and favors overcrowding and, consequently, the exchange of ectoparasites between bat species, reducing the level of specialization and promoting the increased prevalence of bat ectoparasitic flies.",

Following a previous report on bats with alopecia, in this work we complemented the list of bat species with alopecia available in the literature through 2023, adding phyllostomids (Artibeus planirostris, Carollia perspicillata), an emballonurid (Peropteryx pallidoptera), molossids (Molossus rufus, Nyctinomops macrotis), and vespertilionids (Corynorhinus rafinesquii, Eptesicus fuscus, Nycticeius humeralis, Myotis austroriparius, M. grisescens, M. velifer). We also explored factors that may explain alopecia in the first records of this condition in ten Pteronotus mesoamericanus females from Oaxaca, southeastern Mexico, recorded from November 2020 to January 2022. In those individuals, hair loss was observed on the back and head; six of them were lactating and four showed no evidence of reproductive activity. In addition, we documented alopecia on the thorax in four individuals of three species: Artibeus lituratus (one pregnant female and one male with scrotal testes), Pteronotus fulvus (one pregnant female), and Artibeus toltecus (one pregnant female). The alopecic bats presented mild alopecia (the affected area ranged from 1–5 cm2), and only one female showed moderate alopecia (8.1 cm2). Alopecia in P. mesoamericanus, P. fulvus, A. toltecus, and A. lituratus may be due to hormonal or nutritional imbalances associated with reproduction. In addition, in A. lituratus it may also be the result of environmental stress when foraging in an urban area. The causal agents of alopecia in bats are still not fully known, and it is probably a multifactorial phenomenon.",

Landscape features may drive the functional role variability of bat species on the ecosystems. Consequently, landscapes may change the degree of functional differentiation between species. We have evaluated the effect of pine forest monoculture and their environmental characteristics on the distribution and functional attributes of bat species. We sampled bat communities in areas with high (three sites) and low (three sites) forest land use management practices including six mist-netting locations in order to sample for bats at each site. In addition, we have also measured temperature, humidity, percentage of land use coverage (managed forest, agriculture, and native forest), and percentage of canopy openness at each site. We captured 87 bats belonging to eight species representing two families: Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae. For the functional analysis, we used three functional attributes to describe wing morphology: wing loading, aspect ratio, and forearm length. No significant effect of any environmental variable was observed on bat species composition. However, bat species distribution was driven by the ability associated with their functional attributes to occupy the space. Moreover, forearm length was positively correlated with forest cover, canopy openness, and humidity. Species with similar wing morphology have responded in a similar way to environmental variables in the studied areas. Functional dispersion was high in the native forest. The monoculture of exotic species may increase the functional attributes related with vulnerability as described by bat wing morphology. Therefore, the native forest conversion to pine forest monoculture may increase the loss of functional attributes in the bat community.",

            "abstractNote": "Human-modified landscapes are often composed of small and isolated natural habitat fragments immersed in agricultural and urban matrices. Within them, ecosystem services provided by wildlife, such as pest insect suppression, may decrease or even be lost leading to a substantial increase in agricultural production costs. Pest insect suppression by bats has been identified as an essential ecosystem service but remains poorly investigated. For example, we still lack a basic understanding of the proportion of pest insects that comprises the diet of many bat species. Here, we explored the diet composition of eight Brazilian bat species (78 individuals) in a human-modified landscape through the analysis of stable carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) isotopes. Bats were categorised into guilds: open-space aerial insectivores, narrow-space gleaning frugivores, or narrow-space gleaning nectarivores. We divided the insects collected into three groups depending on their δ13C values: forest, mixed, and pest insects. We found that open-space insectivorous bats had the highest proportion of insects in total in their diet — consuming primarily from the forest group (56%) and the pest group (34%). Interestingly, narrow-space gleaning frugivores also consumed pest insects (almost 20%). The narrowspace gleaning nectarivores had traces of insects in their diet, yet the actual proportion was inconclusive. Even though bats were from different guilds, with diets consisting mainly of plants and insects, the δ15N indicated that they fitted to similar trophic levels, as secondary consumers. Therefore, the trophic level of nectarivorous and frugivorous bats showed a more generalist diet than previously assumed. The proportion of forest insects in the diet of open-space aerial insectivores may indicate the importance of small forest patches as food resources for wildlife such as the ones included in human-modified landscapes. The bats’ contribution to this ecosystem service could improve the economic conservation value of Neotropical bats in human-modified landscapes.",

The use of humid hibernacula and ability to drink during periodic arousals allows most hibernators to manage this deficit over the course of a winter. Some populations of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) hibernate in relatively dry rock-crevices that do not contain free standing water. We monitored the winter behaviour and physiology of one such population in the Canadian prairies. Due to the semi-arid climate, we hypothesized that these bats would experience relatively high evaporative water loss and make frequent mid-winter flights to find water. We measured serum ion concentrations and hematocrit to assess level of dehydration in bats captured during winter. We also provided a heated water tank enriched in deuterium (2H) and used stable isotope analysis to test for elevated hydrogen isotope ratios (2H/1H; herein δ2H) in the blood of bats to determine if individuals drank from the tank. We also used passive acoustic monitoring, video surveillance, and passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to determine if bats visited the heated water tank. We found evidence of hypertonic dehydration (elevated hematocrit and concentrations of some serum ions) in bats as winter progressed. Blood δ2H of bats was similar to that of water on the landscape, and acoustic and video surveillance did not indicate any visits by bats to the water tank. Post-arousal dehydration is not uncommon in hibernators, which agrees with our observation that the water tank did not represent a water resource, despite it being the only open (not frozen) water available. It is unknown whether bats may exploit frozen sources of water (e.g., snow) to supplement metabolic water produced from fat catabolism.",

            "abstractNote": "Multiple studies show that animals exhibit consistent individual differences in behavior, but they also experience short-term changes in their behavioral responses associated with seasonal events, most notably reproduction. We compare calling rates between the breeding and non-breeding seasons, and between males and females, in Spix’s disk-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor). This species performs an exchange of inquiry and response calls in a context of social coordination and these vocalizations are used by individuals to signal roost location. Our results indicate that during the breeding season all males vocalize and also emit a greater number of response calls. In females, we found that there is no significant difference in their vocal behavior during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Even though being vocal leads to greater energy costs and risk of predation, males were more vocal and emitted more vocalizations when females are known to be ovulating. Therefore, our results suggest that response calls may not only facilitate group cohesion, as found in previous studies, but that it may also play a role in courtship.",

Because omnidirectional microphones tend to have a shorter range and record more noise than directional microphones, it has been suggested that these microphones be set farther from reflecting surfaces. Our objective was to determine the effects of microphone height (1.5, 5, and 9 m), distance from forest edge (1, 3, and 5 m), and survey timing on the number of bat files recorded, quality of recorded files, the proportion of identifiable files, and the probability of detecting individual species. We deployed 3×3 arrays of two types of bat detectors with omnidirectional microphones at two sites in Kentucky during two survey periods. We found little evidence for effects of microphone height or distance from forest edge on call quality or detection probabilities of any species. In contrast, survey period significantly affected the number of files recorded, the proportion of highquality files, the proportion of identifiable files, and the probability of detecting individual species; the length of the recording session also significantly affected the probability of detecting some species. Thus, it appears that biologists have some latitude when placing detectors with omnidirectional microphones on the landscape but timing of surveys should be considered when designing and analyzing bat acoustic survey and monitoring studies.",

            "abstractNote": "The ability to accurately identify individuals is essential for both management and research of wild or captive animals. Marks need to be clear enough to be recovered, long-lived enough to provide useful information and not have health implications for the tagged animal which may affect survival. Substantial evidence suggests that more invasive, permanent marking techniques such as wing banding can cause injuries to bats, limiting the species with which such procedures can be used. Furthermore, low recovery rates can mean that the long term impacts of permanent marking on survival cannot be assessed. Here we present a new non-invasive, low cost approach to tag bats which can be carried out with the minimum of handling. Recovery of marks is simple and does not require handling. Our approach repurposes ‘queen bee markers’, small, coloured and numbered plastic disks which are commonly used to mark queen bees; instead they are affixed with superglue directly onto the fur of the bat. We carried out a pilot study at a large hibernaculum in West Poland, home to ca. 35,000 bats, the majority of which are Myotis myotis, the target species for this study. In November 2017 we marked 203 bats during a census of the underground fortification system. We recovered 30% of the originally marked bats over a time period of five months; 27% of the originally marked bats were identified to individual when resighted. Fifteen individuals were recovered in March that were not recovered in January, suggesting that they were either missed by recorders or were not present in the system during the census. Using the colour marking system allowed us to derive information about changes in bat behaviour when identification to individual was not possible, and individual identification revealed differences in hibernation strategies. We conclude that bee markers are an effective, cheap and less invasive approach for short term monitoring of bat populations and will also be useful to monitor whether recovery rates warrant the use of more invasive marking techniques.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are one of the most widespread and speciose orders of mammals. Despite their huge biodiversity, little is known about the natural behaviour and ecology of many species given the difficulty in monitoring and studying them. Pipistrellus kuhlii is one of the most common bats of the Mediterranean biome but its ecology remains ambiguous given the scarcity of longitudinal studies. Such basic information is urgently needed to predict the shift of species distribution range under climate change scenarios. Here, we analysed the effects of weather variables (namely temperature, precipitation, wind speed and air humidity) on the body conditions of P. kuhlii monitored in five maternity roosts in Southern Europe over more than a decade (17 years). Using linear mixed-effect models, we disentangled the impact of weather predictors on body condition variations in 347 individuals. Our results revealed species-specific sensitivity to variations in the monitored four main weather parameters. Through the modelling analysis, we show how weather seasonal variables recorded prior to the capture period had a substantial role in driving bat body condition. A combination of warmer spring-summers and cooler winters was found associated with optimal body condition in P. kuhlii. Our analysis also showed that P. kuhlii bats were favoured by higher spring humidity combined with intermediate precipitation and humidity levels recorded during the summers prior to the capture. The latter parameters (precipitation and humidity) were arguably linked with the proliferation of entomofauna on which bats feed. Additionally, we assessed the body condition of 45 bats that were previously captured and tagged either with bands or PIT-tags, two of the most widespread marking techniques for bats. We showed that bats carrying a ring (band) or a PIT-tag had a body condition that did not differ to that expected for untagged bats. This suggests that transponding bats has no significant effect on body condition, enabling new opportunities for passive monitoring and large-scale long-term longitudinal studies for these animals.",

Five social groups, containing both males and females (each comprising 55–230 adult bats per annum, using 37–127 known roosts per colony), occupy discrete roosting areas to which individuals show high inter-annual fidelity. Natal philopatry is also high, compared to between colony movements, for both sexes in our study population. Despite considerable spatial overlap and variability in roost composition over the summer (April to October), related to temporal changes in reproductive status, there is sexual segregation within day roosts. Bachelor (adult male dominated) roosts are situated significantly further from water than maternity (adult female or juvenile dominated) roosts on average. This spatial partitioning between maternity and bachelor roosts operates within rather than between colony home roost ranges, however, with adult males from some social groups found roosting closer to water than are adult females from adjacent colonies. The co-occurrence of maternity and bachelor groups roosting in close proximity, including extensive spatial overlap in roosts occupied, and temporal overlap during roost sharing between the sexes, provides novel insights into social organisation and potential drivers of sexual segregation and mating strategies for this widespread and common species within lowland habitats.",

            "abstractNote": "The Mediterranean is considered one of the richest biodiversity regions in Europe, and bats contribute to this species richness. Within the last two decades, certain bat species traditionally considered as representatives of the Mediterranean have spread northwards and colonized areas outside this region. In our study, we focused on ecological requirements of one of these bat species, the Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). We used radio-telemetry and diet analysis to describe habitat use, home-range size and diet composition of reproductive females of Savi’s pipistrelle in the traditional core of its distribution range in the Mediterranean region. Our results indicate that Savi’s pipistrelle is able to fly long distances and utilize a wide range of habitats within its home-range, with affinities for particular habitats depending on its reproductive status. In particular, pregnant females favoured rocky pastures and forest areas, followed by meadows and riparian habitat, whereas the affinity for riparian habitat increased in lactating females, followed closely by meadows, forest and rocky pastures. The larger affinity for riparian habitats during lactation might indicate its importance for successful rearing of young, which could be influenced in the future by increasing droughts and water shortage in the Mediterranean region. Nevertheless, based on our radio-telemetry and diet analysis the species shows a high degree of flexibility, as an opportunistic forager that flies across large areas on a nightly basis, which may be a good predisposition for colonizing new areas.",
