            "abstractNote": "Background  Bats are increasingly being recognized as important hosts for viruses, some of which are zoonotic and carry the potential for spillover within human and livestock populations. Biosurveillance studies focused on assessing the risk of pathogen transmission, however, have largely focused on the virological component and have not always considered the ecological implications of different species as viral hosts. The movements of known viral hosts are an important component for disease risk assessments as they can potentially identify regions of higher risk of contact and spillover. As such, this study aimed to synthesize data from both virological and ecological fields to provide a more holistic assessment of the risk of pathogen transmission from bats to people.\nResults  Using radiotelemetry, we tracked the small-scale movements of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a species of bat known to host Marburg virus and other viruses with zoonotic potential, in a rural settlement in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The tracked bats exhibited seasonal variations in their movement patterns including variable usage of residential areas which could translate to contact between bats and humans and may facilitate spillover. We identified a trend for increased usage of residential areas during the winter months with July specifically experiencing the highest levels of bat activity within residential areas. July has previously been identified as a key period for increased spillover risk for viruses associated with R. aegyptiacus from this colony and paired with the increased activity levels, illustrates the risk for spillover to human populations.\nConclusion  This study emphasizes the importance of incorporating ecological data such as movement patterns with virological data to provide a better understanding of the risk of pathogen spillover and transmission.",

            "abstractNote": "The degree to which molecular and morphological loss of function occurs synchronously during the vestigialization of traits is not well understood. The mammalian vomeronasal system, a sense critical for mediating many social and reproductive behaviors, is highly conserved across mammals. New World Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are under strong selection to maintain a functional vomeronasal system such that most phyllostomids possess a distinct vomeronasal organ and an intact TRPC2, a gene encoding a protein primarily involved in vomeronasal sensory neuron signal transduction. Recent genetic evidence, however, shows that TRPC2 is a pseudogene in some Caribbean nectarivorous phyllostomids. The loss-of-function mutations suggest the sensory neural tissue of the vomeronasal organ is absent in these species despite strong selection on this gene in its mainland relatives, but the anatomy was unknown in most Caribbean nectarivorous phyllostomids until this study. We used diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) to test whether the vomeronasal and main olfactory anatomy of several phyllostomid species matched genetic evidence of function, providing insight into whether loss of a structure is linked to pseudogenization of a molecular component of the system. The vomeronasal organ is indeed rudimentary or absent in species with a disrupted TRPC2 gene. Caribbean nectar-feeders also exhibit derived olfactory turbinal morphology and a large olfactory recess that differs from closely related bats that have an intact vomeronasal organ, which may hint that the main olfactory system may compensate for loss. We emphasize non-invasive diceCT is capable of detecting the vomeronasal organ, providing a feasible approach for quantifying mammalian chemosensory anatomy across species.",

Abundant candidate hearing-related genes have been identified to be the important genetic bases underlying high-frequency hearing for laryngeally echolocating bats, however, extensive metabolites presented in the cochleae have not been studied. In this study, we identified 4,717 annotated metabolites in the cochleae of two typical laryngeally echolocating bats using the liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy technology, metabolites classified as amino acids, peptides, and fatty acid esters were identified as the most abundant in the cochleae of these two echolocating bat species,\n              Rhinolophus sinicus\n              and\n              Vespertilio sinensis\n              . Furthermore, 357 metabolites were identified as significant differentially accumulated (adjusted\n              p\n              -value &lt;0.05) in the cochleae of these two bat species with distinct echolocating dominant frequencies. Downstream KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that multiple biological processes, including signaling pathways, nervous system, and metabolic process, were putatively different in the cochleae of\n              R. sinicus\n              and\n              V. sinensis\n              . For the first time, this study investigated the extensive metabolites and associated biological pathways in the cochleae of two laryngeal echolocating bats and expanded our knowledge of the metabolic molecular bases underlying high-frequency hearing in the cochleae of echolocating bats.",

Recently, new inﬂuenza-like subtypes have been reported in Neotropical bats, but little is known about the relevance of bats as natural reservoirs of inﬂuenza viruses. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the presence of AIV and new inﬂuenza-like subtypes in South American bats. For a better understanding of the drivers and interactions between AIV and bats, we used molecular assays with different gene targets (i.e., M, NP, and PB1) to identify AIV in New World bats. A housekeeping gene (CytB) PCR was used to check for nucleic acid preservation and to demonstrate the bat-origin of the samples. A total of 87 free-living bats belonging to 25 different species of the families Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae were collected in Casanare, Colombia. As a result, this study found seven AIV-positive bat species, three of them reported for the ﬁrst time as AIV prone hosts. Neither of the AIV-like analyzed samples were positive for H17N10/H18/N11 subtypes. Although additional information is needed, the presence of a completely new or divergent AIV subtype in neotropical bats cannot be discarded. Collectively, the results presented here expand the epidemiological knowledge and distribution of AIV in neotropical free-ranging bats and emphasize the need to continue studying these viruses to establish the role they could play as a threat to animal and public health.",

            "abstractNote": "A large number of microorganisms colonize the intestines of animals. The gut microbiota plays an important role in nutrient metabolism and affects a number of physiological mechanisms in the host. Studies have shown that seasonal changes occur in the intestinal microbes of mammals that hibernate seasonally. However, these studies only focused on ground squirrels and bears. It remains unclear how hibernation might affect the intestinal microbes of bats. In this study, we measured microbial diversity and composition in the gut of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in different periods (early spring, early summer, late summer, torpor, and interbout arousal) using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing and PICRUSt to predict functional proﬁles. We found seasonal changes in the diversity and composition of the gut microbes in R. ferrumequinum. The diversity of gut microbiota was highest in the late summer and lowest in the early summer. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria was highest in the early summer and signiﬁcantly lower in other periods. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was lowest in the early summer and signiﬁcantly increased in the late summer, followed by a signiﬁcant decrease in the early winter and early spring. The relative abundance of Tenericutes was signiﬁcantly higher in the early spring compared with other periods. The results of functional prediction by PICRUSt showed seasonal variations in the relative abundance of metabolism-related pathways, including lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism. Functional categories for carbohydrate metabolism had signiﬁcantly lower relative abundance in early wintertorpor compared with late summer, while those associated with lipid metabolism had signiﬁcantly higher relative abundance in the early winter compared with late summer. Overall, our results show that seasonal physiological changes associated with hibernation alter the gut microbial community of R. ferrumequinum. Hibernation may also alter the metabolic function of intestinal microbes, possibly by converting the gut microﬂora from carbohydrate-related to lipid-related functional categories. This study deepens our understanding of the symbiosis between hibernating mammals and gut microbes.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats and rodents are widely distributed worldwide and can be native or intermediate reservoirs of many important zoonotic viruses. Pestiviruses are a group of virus species of the genus Pestivirus under the family Flaviviridae that can infect a wide variety of artiodactylous hosts, including swine and ruminants. Two classic types of pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus, are important causative agents of mild-to-severe disease in bovine and swine hosts, respectively, and cause tremendous economic losses in these industries. Recent reports revealed that bats and rodents could also act as natural hosts of pestiviruses and an atypical porcine pestivirus, which cause disease in piglets, showed a close genetic relationship with a speciﬁc bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1. This study aimed to describe the detection and characterization of novel pestiviruses from bats and rodents in different locations by analyzing the available bat and rodent virome data from throughout China. Two bat pestivirus species and four rodent pestivirus species that are distinct from other known viruses were identiﬁed and sequenced. These viruses were identiﬁed from two bat species and four rodent species in different Chinese provinces. There were two distinct lineages present in these viruses, that differ from artiodactylous pestivirus. These ﬁndings expand our understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and suggest the presence of a diverse set of pestiviruses in non-artiodactylous hosts. This study may provide new insight for the prevention of future viral disease outbreaks originating from bats and rodents.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats carry many zoonotic pathogens without showing pronounced pathology, with a few exceptions. The underlying immune tolerance mechanisms in bats remain poorly understood, although information-rich omics tools hold promise for identifying a wide range of immune markers and their relationship with infection. To evaluate the generality of immune responses to infection, we assessed the differences and similarities in serum proteomes of wild vampire bats (\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              ) across infection status with five taxonomically distinct pathogens: bacteria (\n              Bartonella\n              spp., hemoplasmas), protozoa (\n              Trypanosoma cruzi\n              ), and DNA (herpesviruses) and RNA (alphacoronaviruses) viruses. From 19 bats sampled in 2019 in Belize, we evaluated the up- and downregulated immune responses of infected versus uninfected individuals for each pathogen. Using a high-quality genome annotation for vampire bats, we identified 586 serum proteins but found no evidence for differential abundance nor differences in composition between infected and uninfected bats. However, using receiver operating characteristic curves, we identified four to 48 candidate biomarkers of infection depending on the pathogen, including seven overlapping biomarkers (DSG2, PCBP1, MGAM, APOA4, DPEP1, GOT1, and IGFALS). Enrichment analysis of these proteins revealed that our viral pathogens, but not the bacteria or protozoa studied, were associated with upregulation of extracellular and cytoplasmatic secretory vesicles (indicative of viral replication) and downregulation of complement activation and coagulation cascades. Additionally, herpesvirus infection elicited a downregulation of leukocyte-mediated immunity and defense response but an upregulation of an inflammatory and humoral immune response. In contrast to our two viral infections, we found downregulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism with\n              Bartonella\n              spp. infection, of platelet-dense and secretory granules with hemoplasma infection, and of blood coagulation pathways with\n              T. cruzi\n              infection. Despite the small sample size, our results suggest that vampire bats have a similar suite of immune mechanisms for viruses distinct from responses to the other pathogen taxa, and we identify potential biomarkers that can expand our understanding of pathogenesis of these infections in bats. By applying a proteomic approach to a multi-pathogen system in wild animals, our study provides a distinct framework that could be expanded across bat species to increase our understanding of how bats tolerate pathogens.",

            "abstractNote": "Animals often mount complex immune responses to infections. Aside from cellular and molecular defense mechanisms, animals can alter their behavior in response to infection by avoiding, resisting, or tolerating negative effects of pathogens. These behaviors are often connected to cellular and molecular immune responses. For instance, sickness behaviors are a set of behavioral changes triggered by the host inflammatory response (e.g., cytokines) and could aid in resisting or tolerating infection, as well as affect transmission dynamics if sick animals socially withdraw or are being avoided by others. To fully understand the group and population level transmission dynamics and consequences of pathogen infections in bats, it is not only important to consider cellular and molecular defense mechanisms, but also behavioral mechanisms, and how both interact. Although there has been increasing interest in bat immune responses due to their ability to successfully cope with viral infections, few studies have explored behavioral anti-pathogen defense mechanisms. My main objective is to explore the interaction of cellular and molecular defense mechanisms, and behavioral alterations that results from infection in bats, and to outline current knowledge and future research avenues in this field.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are important hosts for various zoonotic viral diseases. However, they rarely show signs of disease infection with such viruses. As the ﬁrst line for virus control, the innate immune system of bats attracted our full attention. In this study, the Tadarida brasiliensis MDA5 gene (batMDA5), a major sensor for anti-RNA viral infection, was ﬁrst cloned, and its biological functions in antiviral innate immunity were identiﬁed. Bioinformatics analysis shows that the amino acid sequence of batMDA5 is poorly conserved among species, and it is evolutionarily closer to humans. The mRNA of batMDA5 was signiﬁcantly upregulated in Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian inﬂuenza virus (AIV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected bat TB 1 Lu cells. Overexpression of batMDA5 could activate IFNb and inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP) replication in TB 1 Lu cells, while knockdown of batMDA5 yielded the opposite result. In addition, we found that the CARD domain was essential for MDA5 to activate IFNb by constructing MDA5 domain mutant plasmids. These results indicated that bat employs a conserved MDA5 gene to trigger anti-RNA virus innate immune response. This study helps understand the biological role of MDA5 in innate immunity during evolution.",

Here, we aimed to develop a systematic mapping to identify publication trends and research gaps in studying bats and agricultural systems.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We reviewed 309 studies published between 1990 and 2021 that sampled bats in agricultural systems or evaluated the effect of these systems on these animals.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We found that most studies were conducted in the Palearctic and Neotropical regions (55.3%) and forest biomes (66.0%). Grassland-cropland systems (50.2%) and forest plantations that do not require cutting during the extraction of their products (47.9%) were more studied than forest plantations that require cutting (19.7%). Additionally, acoustic recordings (41.1%) and mist nets (34.3%) were the primary sampling methods used, with few studies combining these methods (7.1%). Also, most studies were conducted on a local scale (77.7%). The number of landscape-scale studies was smaller (34.3%) and concentrated in the Palearctic region (39.6%). Most studies assessed how agricultural systems affect biodiversity (62.1%). However, the phylogenetic and functional dimensions and b-diversity were little explored, with 2.5% and 23.3% of the biodiversity studies, respectively. Of the proposed mitigation measures, the most cited was including natural/semi-natural/potential bat habitats in cultivated landscapes (59.5%).\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              In summary, our findings highlight the need for attention to the Afrotropic and Indo-Malaysia regions; predominantly non-forested biomes; plantations that require cutting during the extraction of their products; combined use of different sampling methods, as well as other methods as telemetry; use of multiple biodiversity descriptors and others biological descriptors, such as ecological services; landscape-scale studies and the role of conservation policies in promoting their conservation and raising awareness of their importance among producers and local communities. Filling these knowledge gaps is necessary to understand the factors influencing bat survival in cultivated landscapes. This is the only way to develop management and conservation strategies in these landscapes.",

            "abstractNote": "Generally, urbanization is a major threat to biodiversity; however, urban areas also provide habitats that some species can exploit. Flying-foxes (\n              Pteropus\n              spp.) are becoming increasingly urbanized; which is thought to be a result of increased availability and temporal stability of urban food resources, diminished natural food resources, or both. Previous research has shown that urban-roosting grey-headed flying-foxes (\n              Pteropus poliocephalus\n              ) preferentially forage in human-modified landscapes. However, which land-use areas and food plants support its presence in urban areas is unknown. We tracked nine\n              P. poliocephalus\n              roosting in Adelaide, South Australia, between December 2019 and May 2020, using global positioning systems (GPS), to investigate how individuals used the urban landscape mosaic for feeding. The most frequently visited land-use category was “residential” (40% of fixes) followed by “road-side,” “reserves” and “primary production” (13–14% each). However, “reserves” were visited four times more frequently than expected from their areal availability, followed by the “residential” and “road-side” categories that were visited approximately twice more than expected each; in contrast, the “primary production” category was visited approximately five times less than expected. These results suggest that while residential areas provide most foraging resources supporting Adelaide’s flying-fox population, reserves contain foraging resources that are particularly attractive to\n              P. poliocephalus\n              . Primary production land was relatively less utilized, presumably because it contains few food resources. Throughout, flying-foxes visited an eclectic mixture of diet plants (49 unique species), with a majority of feeding fixes (63%) to locally indigenous Australian native species; however, in residential areas 53% of feeding visits were to non-locally indigenous species,\n              vs\n              only 13% in reserves. Flowering and fruiting phenology records of the food plants visited further indicated that non-locally indigenous species increase the temporal availability of foraging resources for\n              P. poliocephalus\n              in urban Adelaide. Our findings demonstrate the importance of residential areas for urban-roosting\n              P. poliocephalus\n              , and suggest that the anthropogenic mixture of food resources available in the urban landscape mosaic supports the species’ year-round presence in urban areas. Our results further highlight the importance of conserving natural habitats within the urban landscape mosaic, and stress the need for accounting for wildlife responses to urban greening initiatives.",

We investigated and compared the acoustic behavior of free ranging bats in rural (Havelland, Brandenburg) and urban (Berlin city center) green areas (\n              n\n              = 6 sites) to assess possible effects of urbanization on bat vocalizations using automated real-time recordings from May to October 2020 and 2021. We show that foraging and social call activity of commonly occurring bat species was lower in urban areas compared to rural areas. We present data on rural-urban variation in acoustic parameters of echolocation and Type D social calls (produced during flight) using the example of the common pipistrelle\n              Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n              . Calls from urban sites revealed significantly higher end and peak frequencies compared to rural site calls. In addition, urban social calls present a higher degree of complexity as they structurally differed from rural social calls with regard to assemblage and number of call components. Moreover, urban social calls were emitted in a presumably different context than rural calls: antagonistic social calls in urban areas were detected throughout the year and in the acoustic absence of conspecifics and heterospecifics. Our results provide evidence for the ability of\n              P\n              .\n              pipistrellus\n              to modulate temporal and spectral features of echolocation and social calls, as well as patterns of social call production, in order to compensate for constraints imposed by the urban acoustic environment. We suggest that this acoustic behavioral plasticity plays a major role in the degree of adaptation of insectivorous bats to urban habitats.",

            "abstractNote": "The spatiotemporal distribution of females is a major factor affecting animal social systems. Predation risk and the distribution of feeding resources often determine where females are found, but abiotic factors (e.g., temperature) can also shape the distribution of females and therefore variation in social organization and mating systems. Given the predicted future changes in climatic variation, it is vital to understand how animal mating systems and the sexual selection process may be altered by temperature. In bats, female distribution is tightly linked to roosting ecology and particularly to the microclimatic conditions at the roost. Proboscis bats (Rhynchonycteris naso) form cohesive and stable multi-male-multi-female groups and inhabit exposed day roosts (e.g., tree trunks, vines, buildings). Strong selection to remain inconspicuous to visually oriented predators in the exposed day roosts has been suggested to promote a rather rare male mating strategy termed site-speciﬁc dominance where males defend females directly but are successful in doing so only in their own territory. The choice of open-roost structures can result in the bats roosting under direct sunlight, making individuals susceptible to overheating. Here we investigate whether regular relocations of R. naso social groups among male territories are a mechanism of behavioral thermoregulation. Our results suggest that in general R. naso choose the warmest suitable roost sites within a roost, possibly to minimize the energetic costs of thermoregulation. However, on days with high midday temperatures at the primary roost site, bats commonly relocate to alternative, cooler sites within their roosts. These thermoregulatory relocations entail that a social group regularly switches among the territories of several males. Thus, the need for behavioral thermoregulation determines the spatial distribution of females and shapes the mating opportunities of males during the day. This is supported by our result that territorial males defending primary roost sites are reproductively more successful than territorial males of alternate roost sites. In line with other studies, our ﬁndings suggest that the increase in ambient temperatures associated with climate change has the potential to affect the intensity of sexual selection in bat species and may have far-reaching behavioral, demographic, and evolutionary consequences for their populations.",

Rodent research has focused on a class of neurons in the hippocampus implicated in the representation of allocentric space – termed place cells – and the process by which these representations form. One class of models of hippocampal place ﬁeld formation depends on continuous theta, a low frequency brain oscillation that is prevalent in crawling rodents. Comparative studies of hippocampal activity in echolocating bats have reported many ﬁndings that parallel the rodent literature, but also describe noteworthy species differences, especially with respect to theta rhythm. Here, we ﬁrst discuss studies of the bat hippocampal formation and point to gaps in our knowledge, which motivate our new lines of inquiry. We present data from the free-ﬂying laryngeal echolocating big brown bat, which shows 3-D place cells without continuous theta, similar to reports from the lingual echolocating Egyptian fruit bat. We also report ﬁndings, which demonstrate that the animal’s control over echolocation call rate (sensory sampling) inﬂuences place ﬁeld tuning. These results motivate future comparative research on hippocampal function in the context of natural sensory-guided behaviors.",

            "abstractNote": "Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) emit trains of brief, wideband frequency-modulated (FM) echolocation sounds and use echoes of these sounds to orient, ﬁnd insects, and guide ﬂight through vegetation. They are observed to emit sounds that alternate between short and long inter-pulse intervals (IPIs), forming sonar sound groups. The occurrence of these strobe groups has been linked to ﬂight in cluttered acoustic environments, but how exactly bats use sonar sound groups to orient and navigate is still a mystery. Here, the production of sound groups during clutter navigation was examined. Controlled ﬂight experiments were conducted where the proximity of the nearest obstacles was systematically decreased while the extended scene was kept constant. Four bats ﬂew along a corridor of varying widths (100, 70, and 40 cm) bounded by rows of vertically hanging plastic chains while in-ﬂight echolocation calls were recorded. Bats shortened their IPIs for more rapid spatial sampling and also grouped their sounds more tightly when ﬂying in narrower corridors. Bats emitted echolocation calls with progressively shorter IPIs over the course of a ﬂight, and began their ﬂights by emitting shorter starting IPI calls when clutter was denser. The percentage of sound groups containing 3 or more calls increased with increasing clutter proximity. Moreover, IPI sequences having internal structure become more pronounced when corridor width narrows. A novel metric for analyzing the temporal organization of sound sequences was developed, and the results indicate that the time interval between echolocation calls depends heavily on the preceding time interval. The occurrence of speciﬁc IPI patterns were dependent upon clutter, which suggests that sonar sound grouping may be an adaptive strategy for coping with pulse-echo ambiguity in cluttered surroundings.",

Sample points were selected in stands of similar spatial structure in coniferous (Pinus sylvestris L.), in mixed (Pinus sylvestris and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.), and in deciduous (Quercus petraea) managed forests in western Poland. Bat calls were recorded using automated ultrasound recording devices (Batcorder 3.0, ecoObs, Nürnberg, Germany) during ﬁve consecutive nights from May to September in each of the six stands. A total of 4250 bat passes were recorded. Overall, 63.1% of bat passes were identiﬁed to species, 31.6% were identiﬁed to genus or sonotype group, and 5.3% remained unidentiﬁed. In total, eight species of bats and seven sonotype groups were recorded. The dominant species in all types of forests were Pipistrellus pygmaeus (44.5% of recorded bat passes), followed by Nyctalus noctula (10.3%) and Pipistrellus nathusii (5.7%). There were no signiﬁcant differences in the total activity of bats between the three types of forests; however, high seasonal ﬂuctuations in bat foraging activity were found. This study demonstrates that when coniferous, deciduous, and mixed stands with similar spatial structure are compared, forest type does not affect the foraging activity of bats.",

The peninsula has been occupied for millennia and is a heavily impacted landscape, and, unfortunately, its biotic diversity is among the most poorly studied in Central America. As part of multiyear studies of the ﬂora and fauna of the region, we assess the changes in vegetation and the terrestrial mammal community from earlier times to the present day. Through historical records, interviews with long-term residents of the area, and our studies over the past decade, we document changes in forest cover, settlement, and land use, and assess the changes in species diversity and in mammal species’ abundance. We then discuss the ecology of the mammal species on the peninsula, emphasizing the role that humans have played in inﬂuencing population levels.",

In the present study, ticks collected from underground environments in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and in the Central German Uplands (Federal States of Hesse, Bavaria, Thuringia, BadenWuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Northrhine-Westphalia) were investigated. Six tick species were revealed among the 396 analyzed specimens: Ixodes ariadnae, Ixodes canisuga, Ixodes hexagonus, I. ricinus, Ixodes trianguliceps, and Dermacentor marginatus. Adults and immatures of I. hexagonus dominated the findings (57% of all specimens), especially in shelters acting as potential resting places of main hosts. Ixodes canisuga and I. trianguliceps were for the first time recorded in Luxembourg, and one nymph of the bat tick I. ariadnae represents only the second report for Germany. Collecting ticks in subterranean environments turned out to be a useful approach to increase knowledge about the occurrence of relatively rare tick species, including those that spend most of their lifetime on their hosts, but detach in such environmental settings.",

            "abstractNote": "Eastern European broadleaved forests north of the 50th degree of latitude serve as a core breeding area for most migratory bat species wintering in Eastern and Central Europe. The southern border of this region has faced an increase in clear-cutting intensity in recent decades. We conducted a standardized mist-netting survey on eleven heterogeneous oak forest plots in order to assess how land cover types and forest age affect abundance, diversity and the breeding of bats. We found that abundance indices and species richness increased from upland plots surrounded by agricultural lands to riverine or waterside plots with high forest cover. Particularly large mature forests older than 90 years positively affected the breeding activity of bats, their abundance indices and overall species richness. Regarding species associations with speciﬁc habitats, we found that Myotis brandtii, Nyctalus leisleri and Pipistrellus pygmaeus were mainly found in mature deciduous forest stands, while Plecotus auritus appeared to be the only species tolerating clearcuts and young stands. Forest-dwelling species such as Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus nathusii were additionally associated with water habitats. Thus, the combination of mature forests and water sources is essential in shaping Eastern European assemblages of forest bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Synanthropic roosting may allow cave-dwelling bats to cope with habitat fragmentation provided that suitable buildings are sustainably protected. This study on Asinara Island, Sardinia, focuses on roost requirements in synanthropy at different life stages of two endangered bat species, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. We rated the roost potential of 532 buildings and compared it with actual roost usage. Microclimate was compared across different roost types and between species, and bat composition and behaviour in nurseries of R. hipposideros were related to roost structure and microclimate. The two species occupied 25% of structures rated as “high potential”, versus 5% and 0% rated as “intermediate” and “low potential”. Concerning microclimate, R. hipposideros preferred warmer and drier day roosts, with higher temperature fluctuations during summer, while winter, and night, roost microclimate was comparable between species. In larger, warmer, and drier nurseries, colony size and proportion of reproductive females were higher and parturition started earlier. Before parturition, roost temperatures were inversely correlated to clustering, supporting its thermoregulatory function. Mothers spent in total 50% of the night inside the nursery caring the pup. Roost microclimate, size, and location close to foraging areas may thus promote breeding success. We conclude that a structure-based rating of roost potential supplemented by species-specific microclimatic requirements constitutes a promising predictor of roost usage. Moreover, adequate buildings support the complete life cycle of R. hipposideros in the absence of suitable caves. Buildings thus deserve increased protection measures in fragmented Mediterranean landscapes to ensure sustainable bat conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Identifying unexpected acoustic inputs, which allows to react appropriately to new situations, is of major importance for animals. Neural deviance detection describes a change of neural response strength to a stimulus solely caused by the stimulus’ probability of occurrence. In the present study, we searched for correlates of deviance detection in auditory brainstem responses obtained in anaesthetised bats (Carollia perspicillata). In an oddball paradigm, we used two pure tone stimuli that represented the main frequencies used by the animal during echolocation (60 kHz) and communication (20 kHz). For both stimuli, we could demonstrate significant differences of response strength between deviant and standard response in slow and fast components of the auditory brainstem response. The data suggest the presence of correlates of deviance detection in brain stations below the inferior colliculus (IC), at the level of the cochlea nucleus and lateral lemniscus. Additionally, our results suggest that deviance detection is mainly driven by repetition suppression in the echolocation frequency band, while in the communication band, a deviant-related enhancement of the response plays a more important role. This finding suggests a contextual dependence of the mechanisms underlying subcortical deviance detection. The present study demonstrates the value of auditory brainstem responses for studying deviance detection and suggests that auditory specialists, such as bats, use different frequency-specific strategies to ensure an appropriate sensation of unexpected sounds.",

            "abstractNote": "Passive surveillance for lyssaviruses in UK bats has been ongoing since 1987 and has identiﬁed 13 cases of EBLV-2 from a single species; Myotis daubentonii. No other lyssavirus species has been detected. Between 2005 and 2015, 10 656 bats were submitted, representing 18 species, creating a spatially and temporally uneven sample of British bat fauna. Uniquely, three UK cases originate from a roost at Stokesay Castle in Shropshire, England, where daily checks for grounded and dead bats are undertaken and bat carcasses have been submitted for testing since 2007. Twenty per cent of Daubenton’s bats submitted from Stokesay Castle since surveillance began, have tested positive for EBLV-2. Phylogenetic analysis reveals geographical clustering of UK viruses. Isolates from Stokesay Castle are more closely related to one another than to viruses from other regions. Daubenton’s bats from Stokesay Castle represent a unique opportunity to study a natural population that appears to maintain EBLV-2 infection and may represent endemic infection at this site. Although the risk to public health from EBLV-2 is low, consequences of infection are severe and effective communication on the need for prompt post-exposure prophylaxis for anyone that has been bitten by a bat is essential.",

            "abstractNote": "Because of the immense amount of infrastructure in cities, the introduction of vegetation into these constructions is expected to play a critical role in reducing the heat island effect, in mitigating the effects of climate change, and in supporting habitat connectivity and associated biodiversity. Although there is the perception that these solutions can improve the biodiversity of cities, their real value is still unclear. This paper focuses on two aspects of urban greening: green roofs and green walls. It provides a systematic review on biodiversity present in green roofs and walls, through an exhaustive worldwide literature analysis. Arthropods, bats, and birds were the three taxonomic groups analyzed in the papers included in our review. We observed a strong increase in the number of recent publications, thus demonstrating a growing interest in this topic. In summary, we found that green roofs/walls offered additional opportunities for plants and animals to thrive in urban environments because of habitat creation and greater spatial connectivity. In addition, the enhancement of other ecosystem services such as stormwater management and heat island mitigation was noted. By incorporating green features into urban design and planning, cities can support biodiversity while also improving the overall sustainability and livability of urban spaces.",

            "abstractNote": "Rice represents the main staple food for more than half of the world’s population, playing an essential role in food security and economic growth. One of the major pests affecting this crop is the striped rice stem borer moth (Chilo suppressalis), a widespread species found in Australasia, Asia and southern Europe. Bats are paramount insect consumers and their role as natural pest controllers in agriculture has been increasingly acknowledged, including in rice paddies. In this study we quantify, for the first time in Europe, the economic value of the ecosystem services provided by insectivorous bats as suppressors of a rice pest through exclusion experiments in rice plantations in Spain. Our study design included exclosures that prevented bats from hunting over some experimental areas, combined with molecular analyses of bat guano. By assessing the crop damage levels caused by C. supressalis inside and outside the exclosures, we showed that pest impact almost doubled in the absence of bats (94.5 % of damage increase). We estimated that bats were preventing crop losses of almost 70 kg of rice per hectare on average, which in economic terms would imply savings of 56€/ha. If we extrapolate our results to the national level, these values could reach up to 7.6 tonnes of rice, or more than 6 million euros saved by bats per year in Spain. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing management measures that favour bat populations in agrosystems as part of the Integrated Pest Management strategies to fight harmful insects, thereby increasing yields and land productivity in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.",

Here, we use bat-­ borne tags and DNA metabarcoding of feces to test the hypothesis that greater mouse-­eared bats make immediate foraging decisions based on prey profitability and changes in the environment. We show that these bats use two foraging strategies with similar average nightly captures of 25 small, aerial insects and 29 large, ground-­dwelling insects per bat, but with much higher capture success in the air (76%) vs ground (30%). However, owing to the 3–20 times larger ground prey, 85% of the nightly food acquisition comes from ground prey despite the 2.5 times higher failure rates. We find that most bats use the same foraging strategy on a given night suggesting that bats adapt their hunting behavior to weather and ground conditions. We conclude that these bats use high risk-­high gain gleaning of ground prey as a primary foraging tactic, but switch to aerial hunting when environmental changes reduce the profitability of ground prey, showing that prey switching matched to environmental dynamics plays a key role in covering the energy intake even in specialized predators.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              The expansion of industrial‐scale wind‐energy facilities has not only increased the production of low‐carbon emission energy but has also resulted in mortality of wildlife, including migratory bats. Management decisions can be limited by a lack of understanding of the geographic impact of bats killed at wind‐energy facilities. Several studies have leveraged stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δ\n              2\n              H) of bat fur to illuminate this issue but are limited in the precision of conclusion because δ\n              2\n              H values vary primarily across latitudinal and elevational bands. One approach to increase the precision of geographic assignment is to combine independent inferences about spatial location from additional biomarkers and other related information. To test this possibility, we assigned known‐origin individuals of three bat species (\n              Lasiurus borealis\n              ,\n              L. cinereus\n              , and\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              ) commonly killed at on‐shore wind‐energy facilities in North America to a probable origin using δ\n              2\n              H values, trace element concentrations, and species distribution models. We used cross‐validated calibrated combined model tuning to determine the degree to which assignment probabilities improved when combining datasets. We found that combining markers typically performed better than single approaches. For\n              Lasiurus borealis\n              and\n              L. cinereus\n              , combining all three data sources outperformed any single or other combined approach. With an accuracy set at 80%, an average of 39.7% and 36.0% of each species' total geographic range was considered a potential origin, respectively; stable hydrogen alone included 51.8% and 50.6% of the total geographic area. In contrast, for\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              , including trace elements did not increase precision and adding distribution data to δ\n              2\n              H values only improved precision by 0.6%. Thus, we found that a combination of multiple biomarkers typically, but not always, outperforms single‐marker approaches and optimized combinations of different markers outperform equal weighting of each marker. From a practical perspective, δ\n              2\n              H values performed better than trace elements alone; in cases where cost is a limiting factor, the stable hydrogen should be the single biomarker used in conjunction with species distribution models. Overall, these results highlight the importance of validating methods for each species they are applied to and show that combining information from intrinsic biomarker approaches is a useful tool to document bat movements.",

Most previous studies used proxies rather than actual climate and land-­use data, and their interactions are rarely explored. We investigate whether higher summer average temperatures are driving decreasing bat body size as predicted by Bergmann's rule or increasing appendage size as per Allen's rule. We also explore whether temperature or resource availability (namely forest cover) is responsible for changes in wing functional traits. Using land-­use data from historical maps and national statistics combined with climatic data, we assessed the effect of temperature and resource availability on bat morphology. We used 464 museum specimens of three bat species (Eptesicus nilssonii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, and Plecotus auritus), spanning 180 years, across a 1200 km latitudinal gradient. We found no evidence of higher summer average temperatures driving decreases in body size in bats. Jaw sizes of P. auritus and P. pygmaeus changed over time but in different directions. The geographical variation of forest cover was also related to differences in wing functional traits in two species. Crucially, there was a significant antagonistic interactive effect of forest and temperature on tip index in P. pygmaeus whereby above 14.5°C the relationship between forest and tip index actually reversed. This could indicate that higher temperatures promote more pointed wings, which may provide energetic benefits. Our results show the importance of including both climatic and land-­use variables when assessing trends in bat morphology and exploring interactions. Encouragingly, all three species have shown an ability to adapt their body size and functional traits to different conditions, and it could demonstrate their potential to overcome future negative impacts of climate and land-­use change.",

In North America, arthropodivorous bats are threatened on a continent-­wide scale by the spread of white-­nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. We tested whether bat species that display lower mortality from this disease can partially fill the functional role of other bat species experiencing population declines. Specifically, we performed high-­ throughput amplicon sequencing of guano from two generalist predators: the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). We then compared changes in prey consumption before versus after population declines related to WNS. Dietary niches contracted for both species after large and abrupt declines in little brown bats and smaller declines in big brown bats, but interspecific dietary overlap did not change. Furthermore, the incidence and taxonomic richness of agricultural pest taxa detected in diet samples decreased following bat population declines. Our results suggest that persisting generalist predators do not necessarily expand their dietary niches following population declines in other predators, providing further evidence that the functional roles of different generalist predators are ecologically distinct.",

            "abstractNote": "The expansion of anthropogenic noise poses an emerging threat to the survival and reproductive success of various organisms. Previous investigations have focused on the detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise on the foraging behavior in some terrestrial and aquatic animals. Nevertheless, the role of airport noise in impairing foraging activities of most wild animals has been neglected. Here, we aimed to assess whether foraging behavior in free-­living Japanese pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus abramus) can be disturbed by airport noise. We used audio recording to monitor foraging activities of bats at 11 sites around the runway of a municipal airport. We quantified noise level and spectra, aircraft activity, habitat type, nightly temperature, wind speed, and moon phase for each site. The analysis revealed that noise level and aircraft activity were significant negative predictors for the number of bat passes and feeding buzzes around the runway, even after controlling for the effects of other environmental factors. There was no marked spectral overlap between bat echolocation pulses and airport noise in the presence and absence of low-­flying aircraft. The spectro-­temporal parameters of echolocation vocalizations emitted by bats were dependent on noise level, aircraft activity, and habitat type. These results provide correlative evidence that airport noise can reduce foraging activities of wild pipistrelle bats. Our findings add to the current knowledge of adverse impacts of airport noise on foraging bats in artificial ecosystems and provide a basis for further research on the mechanisms behind noise pollution near airports.",

There are only 32 described species worldwide, including six species in the Afrotropical region. Knowledge on these parasites is limited, and most studies are restricted to the New World polyctenid species. Here we report additional records of Adroctenes horvathi from Kenya and South Africa, as well as Hypoctenes faini from Rwanda. We present an updated list of published polyctenid records in the Afrotropical region indicating their host specificity and their geographical distribution. We report global infection patterns and sex ratio of polyctenids based on previously published data, including Old and New World species. Lastly, we demonstrate the first molecular phylogeny of Polyctenidae, showing their phylogenetic relationship with the closely related family Cimicidae.",

In omnibus surveys that record data on multiple species simultaneously, species ranges are often nonoverlapping and misaligned with the administrative unit defining the spatial domain of interest (e.g., a state or province). Consequently, some species display differentially restricted extents within a study area. Assuming hard boundaries based on expert opinion or published range maps to restrict species occurrence predictions implies a false sense of certainty in model‐based inferences.\n                \n                \n                  We propose a multi‐species occupancy model with a spatial Gaussian process on site‐specific effects for each species as a model‐based solution. Specifying informative Bayesian hyperpriors on the spatial hyperparameters encapsulates broad‐scale correlation among site occupancy probabilities for each species. We fit this model to acoustic detection/nondetection data collected with autonomous recording units during summer of 2016–2019 throughout Oregon and Washington, USA, on 15 bat species.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We found vast improvements in spatial predictions of spotted bat (\n                    Euderma maculatum\n                    ), canyon bat (\n                    Parastrellus hesperus\n                    ), and Brazilian free‐tailed bat (\n                    Tadarida brasiliensis\n                    ) when the available environmental predictors were insufficient for characterizing their restricted ranges within the region.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    In contrast, widespread species (\n                    Lasionycteris noctivagans\n                    ,\n                    Myotis californicus\n                    ,\n                    Myotis evotis\n                    ,\n                    Myotis volans\n                    ) were appropriately modeled using only environmental predictors, such as percentage forest cover and cliff and canyon cover.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Utilizing spatial Gaussian processes within a community or multi‐species model incorporates uncertainty in range boundaries and allows for simultaneous predictions for the entire faunal assemblage even if species have nonoverlapping or restricted ranges within a spatial domain of interest. Such modeling improvements are essential if species distribution models are to accurately inform monitoring, species recovery plans, and other conservation efforts.",

During hibernation, infected little brown bats are able to initiate anti-Pd immune responses, indicating pathogen-mediated selection on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. However, such immune responses may not be protective as they interrupt torpor, elevate energy costs, and potentially lead to higher mortality rates. To assess whether WNS drives selection on MHC genes, we compared the MHC DRB gene in little brown bats pre- (Wisconsin) and post- (Michigan, New York, Vermont, and Pennsylvania) WNS (detection spanning 2014–2015). We genotyped 131 individuals and found 45 nucleotide alleles (27 amino acid alleles) indicating a maximum of 3 loci (1–5 alleles per individual). We observed high allelic admixture and a lack of genetic differentiation both among sampling sites and between pre- and post-WNS populations, indicating no signal of selection on MHC genes. However, post-WNS populations exhibited decreased allelic richness, reflecting effects from bottleneck and drift following rapid population declines. We propose that mechanisms other than adaptive immunity are more likely driving current persistence of little brown bats in affected regions.",

In the tropics, catching bats has been more commonly used as a survey method than acoustic recordings. In our study, acoustic methods based on recording echolocation calls detected greater bat activity and more species than mist-n­ etting. However, some species were detected more frequently or exclusively by capture. Ideally, the two methods should be used together to compensate for the biases in each. Using combined capture and acoustic data, we found that protected forests, forest fragments, and shade coffee plantations hosted similar and diverse species assemblages, although some species were recorded more frequently in protected forests. Tea plantations contained very few species from the overall bat assemblage. In riparian habitats, a strip of forested habitat on the river bank improved the habitat for bats compared to rivers with tea planted up to each bank. Our results show that shade coffee plantations are better bat habitat than tea plantations in biodiversity hotspots. However, if tea is to be the dominant land use, forest fragments and riparian corridors can improve the landscape considerably for bats. We encourage coffee growers to retain traditional plantations with mature native trees, rather than reverting to sun grown coffee or coffee shaded by a few species of timber trees.",

Here we examine the impact of insectivorous birds, bats, and ants exclusion on arthropods communities on replicated 5 Â 5 m of pioneering early successional vegetation plots in lowland tropical forest gaps in Papua New Guinea. In plots from which focal taxa of predators were excluded we observed increased biomass of herbivorous and predatory arthropods, and increased density, and decreased diversity of herbivorous insects. However, changes in the biomass of plants, herbivores, and arthropod predators were positively correlated or uncorrelated between these three trophic levels and also between individual arthropod orders. Arthropod abundance and biomass correlated strongly with the plant biomass irrespective of the arthropods’ trophic position, a signal of bottom-up control. Patterns in herbivore specialization confirm lack of a strong top-down control and were largely unaffected by the exclusion of insectivorous birds, bats, and ants. No changes of plant–herbivore interaction networks were detected except for decrease in modularity of the exclosure plots. Our results suggest weak top-down control of herbivores, limited compensation between arthropod and vertebrate predators, and limited intra-guild predation by birds, bats, and ants. Possible explanations are strong bottom-up control, a low activity of the higher order predators, especially birds, possibly also bats, in gaps, and continuous influx of herbivores from surrounding mature forest matrix.",

            "abstractNote": "Occupancy modeling is important for exploring species distribution patterns and for conservation monitoring. Within this framework, explicit attention is given to species detection probabilities estimated from replicate surveys to sample units. A central assumption is that replicate surveys are independent Bernoulli trials, but this assumption becomes untenable when ecologists serially deploy remote cameras and acoustic recording devices over days and weeks to survey rare and elusive animals. Proposed solutions involve modifying the detection-level component of the model (e.g., ﬁrst-order Markov covariate). Evaluating whether a model sufﬁciently accounts for correlation is imperative, but clear guidance for practitioners is lacking. Currently, an omnibus goodnessof-ﬁt test using a chi-square discrepancy measure on unique detection histories is available for occupancy models (MacKenzie and Bailey, Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics, 9, 2004, 300; hereafter, MacKenzie–Bailey test). We propose a join count summary measure adapted from spatial statistics to directly assess correlation after ﬁtting a model. We motivate our work with a dataset of multinight bat call recordings from a pilot study for the North American Bat Monitoring Program. We found in simulations that our join count test was more reliable than the MacKenzie–Bailey test for detecting inadequacy of a model that assumed independence, particularly when serial correlation was low to moderate. A model that included a Markov-structured detection-level covariate produced unbiased occupancy estimates except in the presence of strong serial correlation and a revisit design consisting only of temporal replicates. When applied to two common bat species, our approach illustrates that sophisticated models do not guarantee adequate ﬁt to real data, underscoring the importance of model assessment. Our join count test provides a widely applicable goodness-of-ﬁt test and speciﬁcally evaluates occupancy model lack of ﬁt related to correlation among detections within a sample unit. Our diagnostic tool is available for practitioners that serially deploy survey equipment as a way to achieve cost savings.",

            "abstractNote": "Many bat species in North America face precarious futures due to white-nose syndrome and wind energy development. These threats, and others, make it imperative to monitor long-term population fluctuations of bats. Counting hibernating bats in caves estimates abundance of these cave-dwelling mammals, and such counts can be used to understand population fluctuations across time. Passive acoustic monitoring can capture large amounts of long-term data that are standardized, scalable, and reproducible; these data can also be archived for future analyses. Little work has been done, however, assessing the relationship between recorded acoustic data from bats that arouse from torpor during hibernation and fly out of caves and number of bats counted in hi­ bernacula. We acoustically monitored and counted two species of bats in 9 hibernacula from November to March 2011 to 2018. We hypothesized that acoustic data recorded from Townsend’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii) and western small-footed myotis (Myotis ciliolabrum) exiting hibernacula could be used to estimate abundance of those species in hibernacula. Over seven years, we conducted 29 hibernacula surveys and simultaneously set passive acoustic detectors during winter when those surveys were conducted. Acoustic monitors recorded for 1,063 nights. Detectors recorded 2,459 files of Townsend’s big-eared bats and 9,094 files of western small-footed myotis. Across all years and hibernacula, mean number of Townsend’s big-eared bats counted in a cave was 96; mean number of western small-footed myotis counted in a cave was 7. For Townsend’s big-eared bats, the top model held 43% of model weight and included the variables bat activity (i.e., mean number of Anabat files/night) and cave. For western small-footed myotis, the top model held 55% of model weight and contained the variable bat activity. Mean number of acoustic recordings of bats flying out of a cave across a winter was positively related to number of hibernating bats counted in a cave in a year for western smallfooted myotis—with greater variability for estimates with a larger number of acoustic files recorded of bats flying out of caves; for Townsend’s big-eared bats that relationship held for 2 caves with > 90 individuals. Our results indicate that researchers can use passive acoustic data as an index of abundance of bats hibernating in caves in temperate climate zones. Additionally, our data indicate that researchers can acoustically detect hibernating western small-footed myotis even when these bats are not observed during hibernacula surveys. This monitoring can minimize the potential effect of researchers on the behavior of bats, facilitate long-term monitoring, and reduce the number of occasions that biologists enter caves to count bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Effective forest restoration requires tools for evaluating and comparing restoration approaches. Nevertheless, measuring restoration progress can be difficult and expensive. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be an inexpensive assessment strategy to collect large amounts of biodiversity information at scale. Nevertheless, analyzing and interpreting this information remains a difficult challenge. In this study we applied and compared three approaches to assess restoration treatments using recordings collected from PAM. We tested the hypothesis that variation in forest structure translates into differences in the species composition and acoustic signature of sites. For this purpose we used a reforestation experiment on the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica, where we compared the mature forest to four restoration treatments. The treatments included natural regeneration and three treatments that varied the ratio of balsa, a pioneer tree species, and other native species. Our first approach consisted of visual and acoustic review of recordings to describe taxonomic groups found in each location. Our second approach consisted of measuring the acoustic energy present in the 10–30 kHz frequency band, an acoustic range primarily occupied by the mating signals of katydids and other insects, important elements of the food web and are often less mobile than birds and mammals. In our third approach we created 24-hour spec­ trograms that represented sites and treatments. Using the 24-hour spectrograms, we calculated a PCA and used a tSNE to evaluate the differences in acoustic signature and visualize clusters of treatments. The first approach revealed that relying on visual and acoustic review would fail to find the diel acoustic patterns that were captured in the other two approaches. The approaches varied substantially in the amount of acoustic data incorporated and the amount of human processing time. Subsampling recordings demonstrated that using only 10 sec instead of 40 sec per recording generated comparable results. The failure to differentiate among resto­ ration treatments could reflect insensitivity in the approaches, but more likely represents the fact that the restoration plots are newly established and that substantial differentiation is more likely to arise during the time course of restoration.",

This dominance reﬂects the challenge of incorporating multiple sources of error into geographic assignments and the nature of spatially explicit dD models, which possess greater latitudinal than longitudinal resolution. However, recent progress in likelihood-based assignments that incorporate multiple sources of isotopic error and Bayesian approaches that include additional sources of information may advance ﬁner-scale understanding of animal movements. We develop a stable-isotope method for determining probable origins of bats within hibernacula and show that this method produces spatially explicit, continuous assignments with regional resolution. We outline how these assignments can be used to infer hibernacula connectivity, an application that could inform spatial modeling of white-nose syndrome. Additionally, estimates of seasonal and annual ﬂight distances for many cave-dwelling bat species can be derived from this approach.

            "abstractNote": "The connections of climatic variables to zoonotic and wildlife diseases remain uncertain. Here, we compiled a systematic database for the prevalence of 121 pathogenic microbial taxa in birds (ca 376 species) and bats (ca 39 species), including 11 939 observations from over 450 000 individuals across Europe and surrounding regions. We modelled the potential connection of climatic variables with the prevalence of 75 pathogenic microbial taxa at a multi‐pathogenic‐taxa level and of 17 most‐studied pathogenic taxa at a single‐pathogenic‐taxon level. According to the multi‐taxa model, the prevalence of bacterial taxa was positively associated with temperature, while this association was significantly weaker for eukaryotes and viruses. The prevalence of bacterial taxa was negatively associated with rainfall, while viruses showed a positive association with rainfall. These associations between climatic variables and prevalence of pathogenic taxa were not different between bird and bat hosts. According to the single‐taxon models, the prevalence of influenza A viruses,\n              Plasmodium\n              , and several bacterial taxa in birds and bats was positively associated with temperature. Rainfall showed positive associations with the prevalence of Usutu, Sindbis and Influenza A viruses but the directions of significant associations varied among bacterial taxa. Strikingly, this was evidenced also between bacterial taxa that share hosts and transmission mechanism hinting towards hitherto unknown features on pathogen ecology, e.g.\n              Salmonella\n              versus\n              Campylobacter\n              and\n              Anaplasma\n              versus\n              Borrelia\n              . Our results suggest that rising temperature and increasing precipitation will accelerate the threat of bird‐ and bat‐associated bacterial and viral pathogens to wildlife, domesticated animals and humans, respectively. However, the idiosyncratic relationships with climatic conditions among pathogenic taxa highlight the need for pathogen‐specific predictive models to understand future pathogen distributions.",

            "abstractNote": "Seasonal utilization of urban areas by bats remains inadequately explored. This study aimed to comprehensively survey the species composition and population dynamics of bats during both the breeding season (May–July) and autumn migration season (August–September) within a large urban area, speciﬁcally Kharkiv city, Ukraine. We conducted multiyear data collection from 2014 to 2016, employing a combination of acoustic recordings, mist-netting, and registration of opportunistically found bats. The results revealed the identiﬁcation of seven bat species using all methods (Eptesicus serotinus, Nyctalus noctula, N. leisleri, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii, P. nathusii, and Vespertilio murinus), with notable differences in species composition between the studied periods. During the migration season, N. noctula was a numerically predominant species, while P. kuhlii and E. serotinus were the most abundant during the breeding season. The urban core bat population during the breeding season primarily consisted of males and solitary reproductive females, mainly represented by P. kuhlii and E. serotinus. Acoustic recording data indicated that N. noctula actively avoided the urban core during the breeding season, but was more common on the city periphery. In contrast, during the migration season, the city experienced a signiﬁcant surge in bat abundance, both in general and speciﬁcally among noctule bats, with their numbers increasing tenfold compared to the breeding season. Moreover, a considerable number of young individuals were observed during the migration season. These ﬁndings provide evidence that bats tend to avoid the urban core in large cities at temperate latitudes during the breeding season but actively utilize urban areas during autumn migration. Understanding the seasonal preferences and movements of bats in urban environments is crucial for effective conservation and management strategies.",

            "abstractNote": "Mangrove ecosystems play important ecological roles, including the mitigation of global climate change and biodiversity conservation. However, they have received little attention from scientists for the research and conservation of bats and general biodiversity. In Vietnam, bat species inhabiting mangroves have been relatively unstudied, while this ecosystem is located along the country’s coastal zones and has declined dramatically due to the development of agriculture, wind energy and other threats. To initially ﬁll this gap, ﬁve bat surveys were conducted between September 2019 and November 2021 within Ha Long Bay and Ben Tre province, which contain representative mangrove areas of northern and southern regions of Vietnam, respectively. Bats were captured using mist nets, mobile nets and hand nets. Their echolocation calls were recorded and analyzed using the PCTape system and Selena software, respectively. Five species were captured and recorded: Cynopterus brachyotis, Macroglossus minimus, Myotis hasselti, Myotis pilosus and Taphozous melanopogon. They are all new to both Ha Long Bay and Ben Tre province. Four species (C. brachyotis, M. minimus, M. hasselti and M. pilosus) have been rarely documented from other ecosystems in Vietnam but have commonly been recorded and captured in mangrove areas. Of these species, M. pilosus is a globally “Vulnerable” species. While searching for prey, Myotis hasselti emitted high energy echolocation calls sweeping from about 96 to about 24 kHz with a signal duration of about 5 ms. This species sometimes uses social calls of a horseshoe-shaped structure, which last about 15 ms and are emitted about 26 ms in front of a search call. Results from our surveys indicated the importance and potential of mangroves for bat research and conservation.",

We recently conducted a bat survey in Son Doong Cave in May 2022 for an initial understanding of the bat species inhabiting this special cave. Bats were captured using mist nets. Echolocation calls were recorded and analyzed using the PCTape system and Batman and Selena software, respectively. Results from the survey conﬁrmed that Son Doong Cave is a home for at least six echolocating bat species of ﬁve genera and four families: Hipposideridae (Aselliscus stoliczkanus, Hipposideros scutinares), Rhinolophidae (Rhinolophus thomasi), Molossidae (Mops plicatus) and Vespertilionidae (Myotis pilosus and Myotis cf. muricola). Of these ﬁve species, H. scutinares and M. pilosus are listed as globally “vulnerable” by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Among the six captured and recorded species from the Son Doong Cave, each species is clearly distinguishable from the others in terms of morphological features, echolocation call structure and frequencies.",

China is one of the world’s megabiodiversity countries, but its biodiversity is seriously threatened by anthropogenic forces. Many studies have identiﬁed priority regions in China for conserving biodiversity. However, most of these studies focused on plants and mainly relied on metrics such as species richness. A comprehensive assessment of functional diversity hotspots of Chinese terrestrial vertebrates is still lacking. In this study, we collected distribution information and functional traits of terrestrial Chinese vertebrates. We calculated functional richness and identiﬁed hotspots. Then, we assessed the overlap between functional hotspots and hotspots identiﬁed based on species richness. We found that the mountains in southern China harbor the most hotspots. Southwestern China is the most important region for biodiversity conservation, as it harbors functional diversity and species richness hotspots of multiple taxa. Mismatches between functional diversity and species richness hotspots were found in all taxa. Moreover, the locations of functional hotspots are different among taxa, even within taxonomic units. For example, the functional diversity patterns of Rodentia, Chiroptera and other mammalian taxa are different. These results highlight the importance of considering distinct groups separately in conservative actions.",

The complex distribution of divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages contradicts, at least in part, nuclear and morphological data. The most likely explanation for this discordance is the historical hybridization between ancestral populations of H. gentilis and H. rotalis/H. khaokhouayensis. Our data supports the species status of H. gentilis, while only partially corroborating its previously proposed subspecies delimitation. We suggest the lowland forest populations from south Vietnam may correspond to their own subspecies. At the same time, the close phylogenetic relationship and morphological similarity of mountain forms from south and central Vietnam to the north Vietnamese populations make doubtful the subspecies status of H. gentilis sinensis.",

However, the eﬀectiveness of biosphere reserves and the contribution of the diﬀerent zones of use to protection is poorly known. We assessed the diversity and activity of bats in the Crocker Range Biosphere Reserve (CRBR) in Sabah, Malaysia, using harp traps, mist nets and acoustic surveys in each zone—core, buﬀer, transition and in agricultural plots outside of the reserve. We captured 30 species, bringing the known bat fauna of CRBR to 50 species, half of Borneo’s bat species. Species composition and acoustic activity varied among zones and by foraging ensemble, with the core and buﬀer showing particular importance for conserving forest-dependent insectivorous bats. Frugivorous bats were found in all zones but were the most abundant and most species-rich ensemble within agricultural sites. Although sampling was limited, bat diversity and activity was low in the transition zone compared to other zones, indicating potential for management practices that increase food availability and enhance biodiversity value. We conclude that, collectively, the zones of the CRBR eﬀectively protect diversity, but the value of the transition zone can be improved.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Emerging infectious diseases remain a significant threat to public health. Most emerging infectious disease agents in humans are of zoonotic origin. Bats are important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses and have been implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events in recent years. It is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of the bat-associated viruses to prevent future outbreaks. To facilitate further research, we constructed the database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir). Known viral sequences detected in bat samples were manually collected and curated, along with the related metadata, such as the sampling time, location, bat species and specimen type. Additional information concerning the bats, including common names, diet type, geographic distribution and phylogeny were integrated into the database to bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists. The database currently covers &gt;4100 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 viral families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide. It provides an overview and snapshot of the current research regarding bat-associated viruses, which is essential now that the field is rapidly expanding. With a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, DBatVir provides a convenient and powerful platform for virologists and zoologists to analyze the virome diversity of bats, as well as for epidemiologists and public health researchers to monitor and track current and future bat-related infectious diseases.\n            Database URL: http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir/",

Chromosome painting with human probes has been applied to 10 bat species from 8 families. Except for the combination 10/12pq/22q, all syntenic segmental associations proposed for the mammalian ancestor have been found in Chiroptera. Bat-specific painting probes, established from 4 species of 3 families, have been used in whole chromosome painting experiments in 29 species from 8 families. The results show that the prevailing mode of chromosomal evolution in bats is Robertsonian translocation with a large number of convergent events. Given our present knowledge of chiropteran karyotypes, only a few elements of the ancestral chiropteran karyotype can be reconstructed with confidence.",
