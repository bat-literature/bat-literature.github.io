In ﬂies fed on subcutaneously infected ERBs and tested from 3 to 43 days post infection (dpi), MARV was detected only in those that took blood during the peak of viremia, 5–7 dpi. Seroconversion did not occur in control bats in contact with MARV-infected bats infested with bat ﬂies up to 43 days post exposure. In ﬂies inoculated intra-coelomically with MARV and tested on days 0–29 post inoculation, only those assayed on day 0 and day 7 after inoculation were positive by q-RT-PCR, but the virus concentration was consistent with that of the inoculum. Bats remained MARV-seronegative up to 38 days after infestation and exposure to inoculated ﬂies. The ﬁrst ﬁlial generation pupae and ﬂies collected at different times during the experiments were all negative by q-RT-PCR. Of 1693 nycteribiid ﬂies collected from a wild ERB colony in Mahune Cave, South Africa where the enzootic transmission of MARV occurs, only one (0.06%) tested positive for the presence of MARV RNA. Our ﬁndings seem to demonstrate that bat ﬂies do not play a signiﬁcant role in the transmission and enzootic maintenance of MARV. However, ERBs eat nycteribiid ﬂies; thus, the mechanical transmission of the virus through the exposure of damaged mucous membranes and/or skin to ﬂies engorged with contaminated blood cannot be ruled out.",

While the mechanisms underlying this ability to avoid sickness are not known, deep sequencing studies of bat genomes have uncovered genetic adaptations that may have functional importance in the antiviral response of these animals. Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are the natural reservoir hosts of Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to humans, these bats do not become sick when infected with MARV. A striking difference to the human genome is that Egyptian rousettes have an expanded repertoire of IFNW genes. To probe the biological implications of this expansion, we synthesized IFN-ω4 and IFN-ω9 proteins and tested their antiviral activity in Egyptian rousette cells. Both IFN-ω4 and IFN-ω9 showed antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including MARV, with IFN-ω9 being more efﬁcient than IFN-ω4. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the transcriptional response induced by each protein. Although the sets of genes induced by the two IFNs were largely overlapping, IFN-ω9 induced a more rapid and intense response than did IFN-ω4. About 13% of genes induced by IFN-ω treatment are not found in the Interferome or other ISG databases, indicating that they may be uniquely IFN-responsive in this bat.",

            "abstractNote": "A basic assumption of the Darwinian theory of evolution is that heritable variation arises randomly. In this context, randomness means that mutations arise irrespective of the current adaptive needs imposed by the environment. It is broadly accepted, however, that phenotypic variation is not uniformly distributed among phenotypic traits, some traits tend to covary, while others vary independently, and again others barely vary at all. Furthermore, it is well established that patterns of trait variation differ among species. Specifically, traits that serve different functions tend to be less correlated, as for instance forelimbs and hind limbs in bats and humans, compared with the limbs of quadrupedal mammals. Recently, a novel class of genetic elements has been identified in mouse gene-mapping studies that modify correlations among quantitative traits. These loci are called relationship loci, or relationship Quantitative Trait Loci (rQTL), and affect trait correlations by changing the expression of the existing genetic variation through gene interaction. Here, we present a population genetic model of how natural selection acts on rQTL. Contrary to the usual neo-Darwinian theory, in this model, new heritable phenotypic variation is produced along the selected dimension in response to directional selection. The results predict that selection on rQTL leads to higher correlations among traits that are simultaneously under directional selection. On the other hand, traits that are not simultaneously under directional selection are predicted to evolve lower correlations. These results and the previously demonstrated existence of rQTL variation, show a mechanism by which natural selection can directly enhance the evolvability of complex organisms along lines of adaptive change.",

HDC bats separate signals from returning echoes in the frequency domain. Rhinolophids are more specialised neurobiologically than hipposiderids, producing longer duration signals at higher duty cycles, and have narrowly tuned auditory fovea and almost full Doppler shift compensation. Here, I examine whether these differences have produced ecological divergence between the families by testing predictions of differences in prey perception, prey capture behaviour, foraging habitat and diet. I found no discernible differences in these variables between the two families. Rhinolophids and hipposiderids both forage close to vegetation, capture prey by aerial hawking and gleaning from surfaces, and consume mostly ﬂying insects with spiders and terrestrial, ﬂightless arthropods taken occasionally. The data presented here show that the two families are similar in foraging ecology despite differences in echolocation and audition.",

            "abstractNote": "The Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae are closely related families of bats that have similar echolocation (long-duration pure-tone signal, high duty cycle) and auditory systems (Doppler-shift compensation, auditory fovea). Rhinolophid bats are known to forage in highly cluttered areas where they capture fluttering insects, whereas the foraging habitat of hipposiderid bats is not well understood. Compared to rhinolophids, hipposiderid calls are shorter in duration, have lower duty cycles, and they exhibit only partial Doppler-shift compensation. These differences suggest that the foraging habitat of the two families may also differ. We tested this hypothesis by studying foraging and echolocation of Hipposideros speoris at a site with a range of vegetation types. Bats foraged only while in flight and used all available closed and edge habitats, including areas adjacent to open space. Levels of clutter were high in forest and moderate in other foraging areas. Prey capture (n=42) occurred in edge vegetation where it bordered open space. Echolocation signals of H. speoris lacked an initial upward frequency-modulated sweep and were of moderate duration (5.1–8.7 ms). Sequences had high duty cycles (23–41%) and very high pulse repetition rates (22.8–60.6 Hz). Variation in signal parameters during search phase flight across foraging habitats was low. H. speoris showed a greater flexibility in its use of foraging habitat than is known for any rhinolophid species. Our study confirmed that there are differences in habitat use between hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats and we suggest that this divergence is a consequence of differences in their echolocation and auditory systems.",

Australian Mammalogy 21: 135138 Diet, foraging behaviour, and hunting habitat of a small sample of large-eared horseshoe bats, Rlzinolophus philippinensis, were studied on Cape York Peninsula. Faeces of three pregnant females of the large form of the species contained Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera. Lepidoptera were present in a ll faeces examined (n=32) and had a high percent volume in most faeces. Upon release, the females were briefly observed hunting while in flight. A radio tagged male of the small form foraged during continuous flight both in rainforest and around buildings in a rainforest clearing, where insects were attracted to artificial light. When hunting around light, the bat captured insects (moths) by aerial pursuit and, on one occasion, through gleaning from the ground. Foraging ecology of the t\\vo taxa was similar to that of sympatric Rhinolophus megaphyllus.",

Myotis daubentoni, Pipistrellus nathusii, Plecotus auritus and Eptesicus serotinus are the most abundant and widespread species, although recently P. auritus has disappeared from some hibernacula. There are still abundant populations of Myotis nattereri, Myotis brandti and Barbastella barbastellus in hibernacula, while their status in summer is unknown. Myotis dasycneme is probably very rare and endangered. The status of Myotis mystacinus and Nyctalus leisleri is not clear, but they are most likely very rare because very few specimens have been found. So far little is known about status of Nyctalus noctula, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Eptesicus nilssoni and Vespertilio murinus because these species are common only during autumn bat migration along the Baltic Sea coast. Two other species, Myotis bechsteini and Rhinolophus hipposideros, have been rejected from the list of bats of Lithuania, because old references to records of these species were not reliable.",

            "abstractNote": "Light pollution constitutes a major threat to biodiversity by decreasing habitat quality and landscape connectivity for nocturnal species. While there is an increasing consideration of biodiversity in urban management policies, the impact of artificial light is poorly accounted for. This is in a large part due to the lack of quantitative information and relevant guidelines to limit its negative effects. Here we compared the potential of two sources of information on light pollution, remote sensing (nocturnal picture taken from the International Space Station ISS) and ground-based (location of streetlights) data, to measure its impact on bats. Our aims were to (i) evaluate how light pollution affected Pipistrellus pipistrellus activity at the city scale, (ii) determine which source of information was the most relevant to measure light pollution’s effect and (iii) define a reproducible methodology applicable in land management to account for biodiversity in lighting planning. We used citizen science data to model the activity of P. pipistrellus, a species considered light tolerant, within three cities of France while accounting for artificial light through a variable based on either source of information. We showed that at the city scale, P. pipistrellus activity is negatively impacted by light pollution irrespective of the light variable used. This detrimental effect was better described by variables based on ISS pictures than on streetlights location. Our methodology can be easily reproduced and used in urban planning to help take the impact of light pollution into consideration and promote a biodiversity-friendly management of artificial light.",

The development of this threat underlines the urgency to adopt lighting practices (characteristics) that have the least impact on species, in particular the most vulnerable species still present in semi-natural areas. It is therefore crucial to better assess the relative effects of the different light parameters for a wide variety of species. Our study investigates the relative effects of streetlights characteristics, i.e. height, lamps type (HPS, LED), illuminance, and the distance to a streetlight on the activity of a variety of species (15) according to their flight traits. We compared bat species activity in lit and dark conditions along streets and in hedges at less than 200 m away from streetlights of various characteristics, in a Mediterranean protected area.",

Although this publication is intended to aid users of scientific and common names, we argue that current practices for authoring, reviewing, and using this list, in some cases, generate taxonomic chaos. By this we mean that users are uncertain of which name to use and/or the rationale for using a particular name, and efficient communication is hindered by this confusion. Most importantly, through inadequate and inconsistent review of this list, the societies have endorsed unnecessary and arbitrary name changes and are uncritically promoting individual taxonomic viewpoints when a clear choice on the most appropriate name has not been reached by the community. This problem is exemplified by North American anurans for which 57 of the 100 species have scientific names (i.e., genus-species combinations) different from the previous version of the list. Forty-eight of these new combinations result from changes to the genus name, and there is controversy over the proposed genus names for at least 43 of these. Despite this controversy and that a stated goal of the list is to report on such controversies, the alternative names are not discussed. As a result, for these taxa, the list fails to provide adequate information for users to make informed decisions on name usage. Here, we examine the role of such lists in taxonomy. Although we specifically focus on the arbitrary changes to the names of North American Bufo and Rana, the continuation of current practices for generating the list will promote instability and taxonomic confusion on a broader scale. We conclude with recommendations for improving the utility of such lists and for avoiding unnecessary taxonomic chaos.",

            "abstractNote": "Threats to North American bat species necessitate the quantiﬁcation of bat habitat. To characterize bat habitat, we recorded bat echolocation calls from state forests in Indiana, USA. We identiﬁed calls using automated classiﬁcation software and constructed detection histories for 3 species of conservation concern: Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), and northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis). We analyzed these data using single- and multi-species occupancy approaches to estimate occurrence and detection probabilities at the genus level (Myotis) and for each species separately. We constructed models using a suite of habitat covariates (e.g., forest cover, edge, streams, hibernacula, public roads) and determined the effect of these features on occupancy for each species (or group). We validated all models using training and independent data. Occupancy of all species was affected by the proportion of forest in surrounding areas. For most models, bat occupancy was greatest in areas with a lower proportion of forest within 1 km. Occupancy was also often greatest in recently harvested or intact, mature second-growth stands as opposed to stands 10–30 years following harvest. The spatial conﬁguration of water and roads also affected species occupancy. Our methods allowed us to assess the factors that affect occupancy for the genus and individual species, thus allowing for the identiﬁcation of features useful in classifying important habitat at both taxonomic levels. The results of this study can aid land managers in identifying habitat that may be used by foraging bats and in planning future timber harvests in managed forests. Ó 2017 The Wildlife Society.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat genomes are characterized by a diverse transposable element (TE) repertoire. In particular, the genomes of members of the family Vespertilionidae contain both active retrotransposons and active DNA transposons. Each TE type is characterized by a distinct pattern of accumulation over the past ~40 million years. Each also exhibits its own target site preferences (sometimes shared with other TEs) that impact where they are likely to insert when mobilizing. Therefore, bats provide a great resource for understanding the diversity of TE insertion patterns. To gain insight into how these diverse TEs impact genome structure, we performed comparative spatial analyses between different TE classes and genomic features, including genic regions and CpG islands. Our results showed a depletion of all TEs in the coding sequence and revealed patterns of species- and element-speciﬁc attraction in the transcript. Trends of attraction in the distance tests also suggested signiﬁcant TE activity in regions adjacent to genes. In particular, the enrichment of small, non-autonomous TE insertions in introns and near coding regions supports the hypothesis that the genomic distribution of TEs is the product of a balance of the TE insertion preference in open chromatin regions and the purifying selection against TEs within genes.",

Our goal was to determine the landscape-scale environmental variables necessary to predict roost occupancy for both species.\nMethods Using MaxLike, a presence-only occupancy modeling approach, with known roost sites, we identiﬁed factors associated with roosting habitat. Spatially independent roost locations were particularly limited for northern long-eared bats resulting in differences in study areas and sample sizes between the two species.\nResults Occupancy of Indiana bat roosts was greatest in areas with [80 % local forest cover within broader landscapes (1 km) with \\40 % forest, \\1 km of perennial streams but[1 km from intermittent streams and in areas with poor foraging habitat. Northern longeared roost occupancy was greatest in areas with[80 % regional but fragmented forest cover with greater forest edge approximately 4 km from the nearest major road.\nConclusions Landscape features associated with roost occupancy differed greatly between species suggesting disparate roosting needs at the landscape scale, which may require independent management of roost habitat for each species.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat conservation in the eastern United States following the onset of white-nose syndrome necessitates the conservation and production of important summer habitat required by bats for both diurnal roosting and nocturnal foraging and commuting. Forest management via silvicultural applications can purposely direct forest succession so important habitat features are retained and developed. The effects of timber harvest on habitat at large spatiotemporal scales for a species are not always readily apparent but can be investigated with spatially explicit forest dynamic modeling. Here we used a forest succession model (LANDIS-II) to simulate future forest conditions under different harvest regimes. We simulated nine harvest scenarios on Indiana State Forests that ranged from a complete cessation of timber harvest to intensive timber extraction. We then applied previously created models of nocturnal and diurnal habitat occupancy for both Indiana and northern long-eared bats. We found that suitable nocturnal habitat was maximized for Indiana bats but minimized for northern long-eared bats under low intensity timber harvest scenarios. Among moderate intensity timber harvest scenarios, both species exhibited the greatest amount of suitable nocturnal habitat when timber harvest applications focused on regenerative openings. The quantity of suitable diurnal habitat trended in the opposite direction of nocturnal habitat with selection harvests favoring suitable roosting habitat. Finally, both species displayed a trend in which overall suitable habitat was primarily driven by the degree of suitable diurnal habitat rather than nocturnal habitat. These results highlight the complex nature of managing multiple habitat needs for more than one species. Furthermore, our research illustrates the importance of understanding the distinct habitat requirements associated with different life history needs that can occur within a single species. Despite such complexities, our results can help guide forest management to preserve and encourage suitable habitat for multiple imperiled bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "The forest habitats of Sulawesi and its attendant islands support diverse bat communities with numerous regionally endemic species. However, these communities remain poorly described, with very little data being published from the region in recent years. In this study we provide a detailed description of the Chiroptera of Buton Island, Sulawesi’s largest satellite island located off the southeast coast of the mainland. Harp traps and mist nets were deployed over two eight-week research seasons between June and August in 2013 and 2014. Survey effort totalled 1,044 mist net hours and approximately 3,148 hours of harp trapping, supplemented with further opportunistic records. We sampled 178 individual bats in the course of this survey work, and identified a total of 23 species, including four species endemic to the Wallacean biodiversity hotspot and three species considered by the IUCN to be near-threatened. We present morphometric measurements for most species presented in our inventory. Our records for one species (Cynopterus c.f. titthaecheilus) in likelihood represent a major spatial range extension, this species not having been previously reported from the Sulawesi region. Our records for an additional 12 species represent minor spatial range extension within the Sulawesi Island group. Non-parametric richness estimators and species accumulation curves predict that further species may be present on Buton: any future survey work should expand the range of habitats surveyed and utilise more specialist equipment to provide the best chance of increasing the known species inventory of the Island.",

Several important collections dating from this period were purchased by Nils Gyldenstolpe of the Royal Natural History Museum, Stockholm, but the collections were never identified, nor were records ever published. These collections present a large number of new locality records, several remarkable range extensions, a number of very poorly known species, and three apparently undescribed species (one bat, two rodents). Formal description of the new forms is deferred until revisions of Tonatia and Oxymycterus are completed. Field observations document several novel roosting habits of bats and foraging sites for certain quadrupeds. Lists of species taken at different sites offer new information on syntopic assemblages of mammals in different lowland and highland sites.",

Of 133 bat species sampled, 53 species in six families were captured frequently enough to allow estimation of their parasite loads. Over all species and six families, prevalence and mean intensity were uncorrelated with these variables, but the number of fly species was correlated with host body mass. Correlations of parasitism with body mass were strengthened among the 44 species of Phyllostomidae. Earlier studies showed that bat roosting habits influence their parasitism by bat flies with more permanent, enclosed roosts being with heavier parasitism. Multiple regressions of all measures of parasitism showed that roosting habits and host body mass, respectively, were the first variables to enter stepwise regressions, together accounting for 20–43% of the variation in measures of parasitism. Lack of correlation between proxies of distribution and abundance with parasitism is taken to indicate that proximate factors such as host-as-habitat, social groupings, and roost microhabitat take precedence over species-wide attributes like commonness and ubiquity.",

Latitude is regarded as a major explanatory variable in species density, although it is only a surrogate for underlying ecological variables. I aimed to elucidate those underlying ecological variables that are associated with variation in bat species richness across the entire North American continent, providing a portrait of the macroecology of the order Chiroptera and its familial components.",

This is especially true in long-lived, group-living species that encounter moderate levels of environmental heterogeneity. Here we review the social learning literature that uses bats as models under the framework of Galef (2009) and Laland (2009) to examine when, where, and from whom bats are most likely to learn socially about food and other foraging behaviour. We conclude that evidence exists for bats learning about novel foods from other bats, learning how to handle such food from other bats, and that bats often learn these ways when uncertain about the quality of different foods available. There is also evidence that young bats learn about new foods from their mothers, and that adult bats learn from other adult bats, even other bat species. However, whether bats more likely to learn from familiar individuals or learn about speciﬁc foraging areas from others is less established and warrants further research. We also conclude that phyllostomid bats present the best evidence of social learning about food and suggest future research, including investigating the possibility of nonhuman culture, focus on this diverse group.",

Although conspecifics tend to be reliable models, heterospecifics with similar resource requirements may be suitable surrogates when conspecifics are few or unfamiliar with recent changes in resource availability. We tested whether\n              Trachops cirrhosus\n              , a gleaning bat that localizes prey using their mating calls, can learn about novel prey from conspecifics and the sympatric bat\n              Lophostoma silvicolum.\n              Specifically, we compared the rate for naïve\n              T. cirrhosus\n              to learn an unfamiliar tone from either a trained conspecific or heterospecific alone through trial and error or through social facilitation.\n              T. cirrhosus\n              learned this novel cue from\n              L. silvicolum\n              as quickly as from conspecifics.

This can create a mosaic of patches with different tree densities that may influence habitat use by foraging bats. Use of forest patches may also vary among bat species due to variation in their manoeuvrability. Apart from studies investigating use of clear‐cuts, few have tested for differences in use of forest patches by bats, or for differences among bat species.\n                \n                \n                  We investigated the influence of various harvesting regimes, which created forest patches of different tree densities, on habitat selection by foraging bats in the boreal mixed‐wood forest of Alberta, Canada. We also tested for variation in habitat selection among species related to differences in body size and wing morphology.\n                \n                \n                  Over two summers we assessed habitat use by bats using ultrasonic detectors to count the echolocation passes of foraging bats. We measured activity in three forest types and four tree densities, ranging from intact (unharvested) forests to clear‐cuts.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Smaller, more manoeuvrable, species (\n                    Myotis\n                    spp.) were less affected by tree density than the larger, less manoeuvrable,\n                    Lasionycteris noctivagans\n                    . Two\n                    Myotis\n                    spp. differed in their habitat use.\n                    Myotis lucifugus\n                    , an aerial insectivore, preferred to forage along the edge of clear‐cuts, while\n                    M. septentrionalis\n                    , a species that gleans prey from surfaces, did not forage in clear‐cuts but preferred intact forest.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The largest species in our study,\n                    L. noctivagans\n                    , preferred clear‐cuts and avoided intact patches. There were therefore differences in habitat selection by foraging bats among the species in our study area, and these were correlated with size and wing morphology.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Our results suggest that, in the short term, thinning has minimal effect on habitat use by bats. They also indicate that silvicultural methods have different immediate effects on different species of bats that may be obscured if the community is studied as a single entity. Management for forest‐dwelling bats must take such species‐specific effects into consideration. Harvesting that creates a mosaic of patches with different tree densities is likely to satisfy the requirements of more species than a system with less diverse harvesting styles.",
