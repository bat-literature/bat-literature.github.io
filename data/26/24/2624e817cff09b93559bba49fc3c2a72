            "abstractNote": "The phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships among the Old World leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideridae) and the closely related horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae) remain unresolved. In this study, we generated a novel approximately 10-kb molecular data set of 19 nuclear exon and intron gene fragments for 40 bat species to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae. We estimated divergence times and explored potential reasons for any incongruent phylogenetic signal. We demonstrated the effects of outlier taxa and genes on phylogenetic reconstructions and compared the relative performance of intron and exon data to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analyses produced a well-resolved phylogeny, supporting the familial status of Hipposideridae and demonstrated the paraphyly of the largest genus, Hipposideros. A fossil-calibrated timetree and biogeographical analyses estimated that Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae diverged in Africa during the Eocene approximately 42 Ma. The phylogram, the timetree, and a unique retrotransposon insertion supported the elevation of the subtribe Rhinonycterina to family level and which is diagnosed herein. Comparative analysis of diversification rates showed that the speciose genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros underwent diversification during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. The intron versus exon analyses demonstrated the improved nodal support provided by introns for our optimal tree, an important finding for large-scale phylogenomic studies, which typically rely on exon data alone. With the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by a novel coronavirus, the study of these species is urgent as they are considered the natural reservoir for emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses. It has been shown that host phylogeny is the primary factor that determines a virus's persistence, replicative ability, and can act as a predictor of new emerging disease. Therefore, this newly resolved phylogeny can be used to direct future assessments of viral diversity and to elucidate the origin and development of SARS-like coronaviruses in mammals.",

For example, exposure to bats is the main source of human rabies in the Americas. But rabies is not generally transmitted among people; humans are a dead end for the virus.\n              \n                Streicker\n                et al.\n              \n              (p.\n              676\n              , see the cover) show that rabies virus lineages tend to be specific for bat lineages. It seems that although rabies viruses have the potential for rapid evolution, this property alone is not enough to overcome genetic barriers, which inhibit the onward transmission of rabies virus into a new species. White-nose syndrome, an exotic fungal infection of bats, has, over the past 3 years, spread from upstate New York to West Virginia, killing on average 70% of the animals in a hibernating colony. The infection makes bats restless over winter when they should be dormant, which makes them exhaust their fat reserves, resulting in the death of over a million bats.\n              \n                Frick\n                et al.\n              \n              (p.\n              679\n              ) have analyzed population data collected on bats in the northeastern United States for the past 30 years and show that, mainly owing to white-nose syndrome, the once abundant little brown bat is heading for regional extinction in the next 16 years or so. This scale of loss of an insectivorous mammal is expected to have repercussions for ecosystem integrity and for the economic costs of agricultural pest control.\n            \n          , \n            Rabies virus’ innate capacity to replicate and adapt cannot overcome host genetic barriers to cross-species transfer.\n          , \n            For RNA viruses, rapid viral evolution and the biological similarity of closely related host species have been proposed as key determinants of the occurrence and long-term outcome of cross-species transmission. Using a data set of hundreds of rabies viruses sampled from 23 North American bat species, we present a general framework to quantify per capita rates of cross-species transmission and reconstruct historical patterns of viral establishment in new host species using molecular sequence data. These estimates demonstrate diminishing frequencies of both cross-species transmission and host shifts with increasing phylogenetic distance between bat species. Evolutionary constraints on viral host range indicate that host species barriers may trump the intrinsic mutability of RNA viruses in determining the fate of emerging host-virus interactions.",

            "abstractNote": "The majority of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, with viruses that originate in wild mammals of particular concern (for example, HIV, Ebola and SARS). Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population within a species range-which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease devastating hibernating North American bat populations that is caused by the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans. Previous histopathological analysis demonstrated little evidence of inflammatory responses in infected bats, however few studies have compared other aspects of immune function between WNS-affected and unaffected bats. We collected bats from confirmed WNS-affected and unaffected sites during the winter of 2008-2009 and compared estimates of their circulating levels of total leukocytes, total immunoglobulins, cytokines and total antioxidants. Bats from affected and unaffected sites did not differ in their total circulating immunoglobulin levels, but significantly higher leukocyte counts were observed in bats from affected sites and particularly in affected bats with elevated body temperatures (above 20°C). Bats from WNS-affected sites exhibited significantly lower antioxidant activity and levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), a cytokine that induces T cell differentiation. Within affected sites only, bats exhibiting visible fungal infections had significantly lower antioxidant activity and levels of IL-4 compared to bats without visible fungal infections. Overall, bats hibernating in WNS-affected sites showed immunological changes that may be evident of attempted defense against G. destructans. Observed changes, specifically elevated circulating leukocytes, may also be related to the documented changes in thermoregulatory behaviors of affected bats (i.e. increased frequencies in arousal from torpor). Alterations in immune function may reflect expensive energetic costs associated with these processes and intrinsic qualities of the immunocapability of hibernating bats to clear fungal infections. Additionally, lowered antioxidant activity indicates a possible imbalance in the pro- versus antioxidant system, may reflect oxidative tissue damage, and should be investigated as a contributor to WNS-associated morbidity and mortality.",

Genome sequences have identified evidence for a striking expansion of and positive selection in gene families associated with immunity. Bats have also been known to be hosts of malaria parasites for over a century, and as hosts, they possess perhaps the most phylogenetically diverse set of hemosporidian genera and species. To provide a molecular framework for the study of these parasites, we surveyed bats in three remote areas of the Upper Guinean forest ecosystem. We detected four distinct genera of hemosporidian parasites: Plasmodium, Polychromophilus, Nycteria, and Hepatocystis. Intriguingly, the two species of Plasmodium in bats fall within the clade of rodent malaria parasites, indicative of multiple host switches across mammalian orders. We show that Nycteria species form a very distinct phylogenetic group and that Hepatocystis parasites display an unusually high diversity and prevalence in epauletted fruit bats. The diversity and high prevalence of novel lineages of chiropteran hemosporidians underscore the exceptional position of bats among all other mammalian hosts of hemosporidian parasites and support hypotheses of pathogen tolerance consistent with the exceptional immunology of bats.",

Bats were followed for 12.7  6.3 (s d) days. Home-range sizes were among the largest published for Microchiroptera. Median minimum convex polygons (100% MCPs) for adult males were 1589 ha (max = 5629 ha), 1361 ha for post-lactating females, and 657 ha for non-reproductive females. Ranges of lactating females (median = 330 ha), were signi®cantly smaller. Juveniles that were volant for < 2 weeks had the smallest ranges (median = 237 ha) but movements increased signi®cantly after c. 2 weeks to a median of 2006 ha. Movements were frequent and rapid within the range (790  471 s d m/15 min) and average range lengths were 3.3±10.9 km (max = 19 km). Despite their large home ranges, bats concentrated their activity (85% of ®xes) in small core areas that represented a mean of 5.7  1.5% (s d) of the 100% MCPs. Ranges of roosting sites were also small, averaging 9.4  1.8% (s d) of total range size. Bats followed similar movement patterns each night but core areas only overlapped by 43  14% (s d) from one night to the next. Moderately low levels of overlap of home ranges (31±68%) and of core areas (23±56%) among individuals of the same reproductive class suggest a degree of spatial segregation among bats from the same roosting group. A prediction that C. tuberculatus has large ranges to minimize overlap between foraging bats, re¯ecting scarcity of food, requires testing. Range sizes were probably underestimates of seasonal, annual, and life-time range requirements. Nevertheless, large range size and the degree of individual spacing implies that conservation areas designed for bats should be large and that protection of roosting areas alone would not be suf®cient to protect bat populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Serotine nursery roosts with less than 20 bats were found to have home ranges of at least 24 to 77 km\n              2\n              and core areas of activity from 13 to 33 km\n              2\n              . The size of the range may have increased further if more individuals had been tracked, as three of the four colonies studied had not reached their asymptotes. The total home‐range area covered by four serotine colonies was 127.36 km\n              2\n              . Excluding non‐breeding bats, a density of one bat per 120 ha was estimated. However, actual density was likely to be higher if there were additional non‐breeding females and immatures that were not in nursery roosts. Colonial home ranges and core areas overlapped, with individuals from different colonies feeding at the same sites. Individual home ranges (\n              n\n              = 32) varied from 0.16 to 47.58 km\n              2\n              , but these were not used exclusively by one individual. Around the colonial core area and breeding roosts, home ranges were used by all individuals from a single colony. It is only further from the core area that ranges appeared to be used by individuals. The distance from roost to feeding areas varied by up to 7.4 km, but the bat usually commuted along lines of trees and hedges and over pastures. This resulted in greater distances being travelled than if they had flown by a direct route. On average, individuals commuted distances of 8 km each night between feeding areas, with a maximum distance of over 41 km. They visited between 0 and 10 feeding sites each night (mean = 2.89).",

            "abstractNote": "UNLABELLED: The Paramyxoviridae form an increasingly diverse viral family, infecting a wide variety of different hosts. In recent years, they have been linked to disease emergence in many different animal populations and in humans. Bats and rodents have been identified as major animal populations capable of harboring paramyxoviruses, and host shifting between these animals is likely to be an important driving factor in the underlying evolutionary processes that eventually lead to disease emergence. Here, we have studied paramyxovirus circulation within populations of endemic and introduced wild small mammals of the southwestern Indian Ocean region and belonging to four taxonomic orders: Rodentia, Afrosoricida, Soricomorpha, and Chiroptera. We report elevated infection levels as well as widespread paramyxovirus dispersal and frequent host exchange of a newly emerging genus of the Paramyxoviridae, currently referred to as the unclassified morbillivirus-related viruses (UMRVs). In contrast to other genera of the Paramyxoviridae, where bats have been shown to be a key host species, we show that rodents (and, in particular, Rattus rattus) are significant spreaders of UMRVs. We predict that the ecological particularities of the southwestern Indian Ocean, where small mammal species often live in densely packed, multispecies communities, in combination with the increasing invasion of R. rattus and perturbations of endemic animal communities by active anthropological development, will have a major influence on the dynamics of UMRV infection. IMPORTANCE: Identification of the infectious agents that circulate within wild animal reservoirs is essential for several reasons: (i) infectious disease outbreaks often originate from wild fauna; (ii) anthropological expansion increases the risk of contact between human and animal populations and, as a result, the risk of disease emergence; (iii) evaluation of pathogen reservoirs helps in elaborating preventive measures to limit the risk of disease emergence. Many paramyxoviruses for which bats and rodents serve as major reservoirs have demonstrated their potential to cause disease in humans and animals. In the context of the biodiversity hot spot of southwestern Indian Ocean islands and their rich endemic fauna, we show that highly diverse UMRVs exchange between various endemic animal species, and their dissemination likely is facilitated by the introduced Rattus rattus. Hence, many members of the Paramyxoviridae appear well adapted for the study of the viral phylodynamics that may be associated with disease emergence.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Factors related to the natural transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) to humans are still not well defined. Results of previous sero-prevalence studies suggest that circulation of EBOV in human population is common in sub-Saharan Africa. The Efé pygmies living in Democratic Republic of the Congo are known to be exposed to potential risk factors of EBOV infection such as bush meat hunting, entry into caves, and contact with bats. We studied the pygmy population of Watsa region to determine seroprevalence to EBOV infection and possible risks factors.\nMETHOD: Volunteer participants (N = 300) aged 10 years or above were interviewed about behavior that may constitute risk factors for transmission of EBOV, including exposures to rats, bats, monkeys and entry into caves. Samples of venous blood were collected and tested for IgG antibody against EBOV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The χ2-test and Fisher's exact test were used for the comparison of proportions and the Student's t-test to compare means. The association between age group and anti-EBOV IgG prevalence was analysed by a nonparametric test for trend.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of anti-EBOV IgG was 18.7 % overall and increased significantly with age (p = 0.023). No association was observed with exposure to risk factors (contacts with rats, bats, monkeys, or entry into caves).\nCONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of IgG antibody to EBOV in pygmies in Watsa region is among the highest ever reported, but it remains unclear which exposures might lead to this high infection rate calling for further ecological and behavioural studies.",

            "abstractNote": "Members of the viral family Circoviridae are increasingly recognized worldwide. Bats seem to be natural reservoirs or dietary-related dispensers of these viruses. Here, we report a distantly related member of the genus Cyclovirus detected in the faeces of a great roundleaf bat (Hipposideros armiger). Interestingly, the novel virus lacks a Circoviridae-speciﬁc stem-loop structure, although a Geminiviridae-like nonamer sequence was detected in the large intergenic region. Based on these differences and its phylogenetic position, we propose that our new virus represents a distant and highly divergent member of the genus Cyclovirus. However it is lacking several characteristics of members of the genus, which raises a challenge in its taxonomic classiﬁcation.",

We investigated the prevalence and genetic diversity of HBV in bats in China. In this study, a total of 197 insectivorous bats belonging to 10 bat species were captured from karst caves in Mengyin County, Shandong Province and Xianning City, Hubei Province, China. PCR ampliﬁcation indicated that in total 6.6% (13/197) bats were positive to HBVs. The HBV positive rate in bats was 7.1% (9/127) and 5.7% (4/70) in Shandong Province and Hubei Province, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HBV from the two places were in the same cluster with 90.5%–99.5% homology, but distinct from bat HBVs from other places in China and other countries. We concluded that HBV was prevalent and genetic diversiﬁed in bats, supporting the hypothesis that bats may be the origin of primate hepadnaviruses.",

Between 2000 and 0330 h, females nursed their young an average of two times for a total of ca. 52 min. Females nursed only their own babies; they occasionally interacted with other young and adults. most frequently by touching noses. Adults returned to and left their young independently of each other, not in synchronized fashion. Between 0500 and 1900 h, adults seldom interacted, although they were clustered tightly. Young were in a nursing position, presumably nursing, ca. 50% of the time. Adults never appeared to sleep and spent 74% of the day quietly alert and 24% grooming themselves. We observed no cooperative behavior such as allogrooming, communal nursing, or sharing of food at any time. We suggest that absence of stable associations of adults caused by long-:-distance migration and occasional changes in roosting sites has prevented evolution of overtly cooperative behavior in dayroosts of L. curasoae.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are susceptible to rabies. Although bats may appear to be asymptomatic carriers of rabies for a few days, eventually they fall ill to the viral infection and die. Two of at least four bat-specific variants of rabies virus in Canada have killed humans. Rabies is usually transmitted by biting, but bats are small mammals so their bites may go unnoticed. People exposed to rabid animals should receive postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). With 60 known human deaths from 1950 to 2009, rabies is rare in Canada and the United States of America compared with India where it kills over 100 people annually. In Asia and Africa, most human rabies is acquired from dog bites. In Brazil, dog and bat bites together account for >80% of human rabies. In Canada, rabies is a disease primarily confined to wildlife (foxes, racoons, skunks, and bats). The public image of bats is negatively affected by their association with diseases. Too often bats are victimized by allegations of their role in deadly diseases such as rabies, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In general, bats are not dangerous, but humans should seek treatment if they are bitten by one. (Graphical abstract shows a 4-g elegant myotis biting MBF’s finger—photo by Sherri and Brock Fenton.)",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Despite conservation discourses in Madagascar increasingly emphasizing the role of customary institutions for wildlife management, we know relatively little about their effectiveness. Here, we used semi-structured interviews with 54 adults in eight villages to investigate whether sacred caves and taboos offer conservation benefits for cave-dwelling bats in and around Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, south-west Madagascar. Although some caves were described as sites of spiritual significance for the local communities, most interviewees (c. 76%) did not recognize their present-day sacred status. Similarly, only 22% of the interviewees recognized taboos inhibiting bat hunting and consumption. Legal protection of bats and caves through protected areas was often more widely acknowledged than customary regulations, although up to 30% of the interviewees reported consumption of bats within their communities. Guano extraction was often tolerated in sacred caves in exchange for economic compensation. This may benefit bat conservation by creating incentives for bat protection, although extraction is often performed through destructive and exploitative practices with little benefit for local communities. In view of these results our study questions the extent to which sacred sites, taboos and protected areas offer protection for bats in Madagascar. These results support previous studies documenting the erosion of customary institutions in Madagascar, including the loss of the spiritual values underpinning sacred sites. Given that many Malagasy bats are cave-dwelling species and that most depend on the customary protection of these sites, it is important to obtain a better understanding of the complex interactions between spiritual practices, taboos and protected areas in sustaining bat diversity.",

Although the species roosted in different locations (S. borbonicus in hollow mopane trees, R. hildebrandti in a hollow baobab tree, and T. midas in buildings), roost temperatures and the bats' body temperatures were generally similar. The S. borbonicus and T. midas flew continuously while foraging in pursuit of flying prey; the R. hildebrandti switched between continuous flight, and hunting from a perch also in pursuit of flying prey. All three species foraged for about 60 min nightly, but the T. midas ventured at least 10 km from their roosts, while for S. borbonicus and R. hildebrandti, comparable figures were 4 and 2 km, respectively. The three species showed a spectrum of wing morphology and echolocation call design features from clutter resistant (R. hildebrandti) to relatively clutter resistant (S. borbonicus) and clutter intolerant (T. midas) and the foraging areas used by the bats corresponded to these features. Rhinolophus hildebrandti foraged below the canopy in riverine forest and deciduous woodland, while S. borbonicus foraged around the canopy but not closer than 0.5 m to it, while T. midas foraged in the open well above the canopy. These differences are discussed along with variations in foraging behaviour in insectivorous bats.",

A total of 6400 bats was handled during studies of swarming at 10 hibernacula in Ontario and Quebec from 1966 to 1968. Juveniles comprised over 50% of the swarming population, and the proportion of females in this population was greater than that observed in hibernating populations. Two phases of swarming have been distinguished: the first, occurring in August, lacks both sexual activity and a hibernating population, and the second, which begins in September, involves both sexual activity and the buildup of a hibernating population. Possible functions of swarming are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Thirty-six of the 70 species of bats known from Belize were recorded from the area around Lamanai, Orange Walk County: two in roosts and 34 in about 680 mist net hours that produced 560 captures. Day roosts used by 35 of the species were located using radio-tracking (Sturnira lilium, Platyrrhinus helleri, Centurio senex and Bauerus dubiaquercus) or general searching for roosts (Rhynchonycteris naso, Saccopteryx bilineata, Saccopteryx leptura, Diclidurus albus, Mimon bennettii, Micronycteris schmidtorum, Carollia brevicauda, Carollia perspicillata and Eptesicus furinalis). Data on the day roosts of 23 other species were determined from the literature. Most species reported from Lamanai (19) roosted in hollows, while others used foliage (6), tents (3), sheltered sites (2), crevices (2), open sites (1), and a few species used more than one type of day roost (hollows and crevices (1); hollows and foliage (1); hollows, foliage and tents (1)). The fauna consisted of 13 aerial foragers, 9 gleaners, 11 fruit/leaf eaters, one trawler, one ﬂower-visitor and one blood-feeder. In day roost use and foraging behaviour, the Lamanai fauna did not differ signiﬁcantly from that of Paracou, French Guiana, but both these locations differed from the bat fauna of Kruger National Park, South Africa, in foraging behaviour.",

There was marked seasonal variation in the prey taken, with bats and frogs dominating the biomass at different times. In November 1987, all-night radio-tracking over 15 bat nights revealed significant differences in habitat use between individuals, with one bat foraging along and over the Zambezi River, and another foraging in Acacia albida woodland and over the river. The bats alternated between foraging from continuous flight and making short flights from perches, although foraging over the river usually entailed continuous flight. Significant differences in the use of these foraging strategies between 1987 and an earlier study coincided with differences in November rainfall, and a drastic reduction in the amount of food the bats consumed daily.",

Bats appear effectively to dominate the aerial nocturnal adaptive zones of fruit and insect eating, although they are more effective as small rather than as large insectivores. In most tropical locations, either owls or bats are regular consumers of fish; bats which feed on terrestrial vertebrates and the bird families Podargidae, Aegothelidae, and Nyctibiidae seem to occupy the adaptive zone of small owls, but these bats and birds are limited anatomically from replacing larger owls. Bat hawks (Falco rufigularis and Macheiramphus alcinus) and some carnivorous bats may be the only regular aerial predators of bats. The use that many bats make of night roosts as locations for food consumption, and the nocturnal roosting habits of some diurnal birds may represent adaptations for avoid. ing nocturnal, volant predators.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats may host emerging viruses, including coronaviruses (CoV). We conducted an evaluation of CoV in rhinolophid and vespertilionid bat species common in Europe. Rhinolophids carried severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV at high frequencies and concentrations (26% of animals are positive; up to 2.4×10(8) copies per gram of feces), as well as two Alphacoronavirus clades, one novel and one related to the HKU2 clade. All three clades present in Miniopterus bats in China (HKU7, HKU8, and 1A related) were also present in European Miniopterus bats. An additional novel Alphacoronavirus clade (bat CoV [BtCoV]/BNM98-30) was detected in Nyctalus leisleri. A CoV grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 816-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of all accepted mammalian CoV species (RdRp-based grouping units [RGU]). Criteria for defining separate RGU in mammalian CoV were a >4.8% amino acid distance for alphacoronaviruses and a >6.3% distance for betacoronaviruses. All the above-mentioned novel clades represented independent RGU. Strict associations between CoV RGU and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent RGU represented simultaneously in China and Europe. A SARS-related virus (BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from a Rhinolophus blasii (Rhi bla) bat was fully sequenced. It is predicted that proteins 3b and 6 were highly divergent from those proteins in all known SARS-related CoV. Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was surprisingly absent. Surface expression of spike and staining with sera of SARS survivors suggested low antigenic overlap with SARS CoV. However, the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV showed higher similarity with that of BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008 than with that of any Chinese bat-borne CoV. Critical spike domains 472 and 487 were identical and similar, respectively. This study underlines the importance of assessments of the zoonotic potential of widely distributed bat-borne CoV.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats host noteworthy viral pathogens, including coronaviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses. Knowledge on the ecology of reservoir-borne viruses is critical for preventive approaches against zoonotic epidemics. We studied a maternity colony of Myotis myotis bats in the attic of a private house in a suburban neighborhood in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, during 2008, 2009, and 2010. One coronavirus, 6 astroviruses, and 1 novel adenovirus were identified and monitored quantitatively. Strong and specific amplification of RNA viruses, but not of DNA viruses, occurred during colony formation and after parturition. The breeding success of the colony was significantly better in 2010 than in 2008, in spite of stronger amplification of coronaviruses and astroviruses in 2010, suggesting that these viruses had little pathogenic influence on bats. However, the general correlation of virus and bat population dynamics suggests that bats control infections similar to other mammals and that they may well experience epidemics of viruses under certain circumstances.",

            "abstractNote": "The large virus family Paramyxoviridae includes some of the most significant human and livestock viruses, such as measles-, distemper-, mumps-, parainfluenza-, Newcastle disease-, respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumoviruses. Here we identify an estimated 66 new paramyxoviruses in a worldwide sample of 119 bat and rodent species (9,278 individuals). Major discoveries include evidence of an origin of Hendra- and Nipah virus in Africa, identification of a bat virus conspecific with the human mumps virus, detection of close relatives of respiratory syncytial virus, mouse pneumonia- and canine distemper virus in bats, as well as direct evidence of Sendai virus in rodents. Phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds. Hypothesis tests in a maximum likelihood framework permit the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to both the major Paramyxoviridae subfamilies (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae). Future attempts to predict the emergence of novel paramyxoviruses in humans and livestock will have to rely fundamentally on these data. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "In 2002/2003, a novel coronavirus (CoV) caused a pandemic, infecting more than 8000 people, of whom nearly 10% died. This virus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV was linked to a zoonotic origin from rhinolophid bats in 2005. Since then, numerous studies have described novel bat CoVs, including close relatives of the newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this paper we discuss CoV genomic properties and compare different taxonomic approaches in light of the technical difficulties of obtaining full genomic sequences directly from bat specimens. We first present an overview of the available studies on bat CoVs, with details on their chiropteran hosts, then comparatively analyze the increase in bat CoV studies and novel genomic sequences obtained since the SARS pandemic. We then conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus, to show that bats harbour more CoV diversity than other mammalian hosts and are widely represented in most, but not all parts of the tree of mammalian CoVs. We next discuss preliminary evidence for phylogenetic co-segregation of CoVs and bat hosts encompassing the Betacoronavirus clades b and d, with an emphasis on the sampling bias that exists among bat species and other mammals, then present examples of CoVs infecting different hosts on the one hand and viruses apparently confined to host genera on the other. We also demonstrate a geographic bias within available studies on bat CoVs, and identify a critical lack of information from biodiversity hotspots in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We then present evidence for a zoonotic origin of four of the six known human CoVs (HCoV), three of which likely involved bats, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E; compare the available data on CoV pathogenesis in bats to that in other mammalian hosts; and discuss hypotheses on the putative insect origins of CoV ancestors. Finally, we suggest caution with conclusions on the zoonotic potential of bat viruses, based only on genomic sequence data, and emphasize the need to preserve these ecologically highly relevant animals. This paper forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on \"from SARS to MERS: 10years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses\".",

            "abstractNote": "The winter community structure of bats visiting Muierilor Cave, Romania, was studied between 2004 and 2008. Field observations revealed the presence in the hibernacula of the following species: Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis myotis/oxygnathus, Myotis emarginatus, Myotis daubentonii and Miniopterus schreibersii. The hibernating bat assemblages were characterized by a significant dominance of R. ferrumequinum and M. schreibersii. During the eight visits conducted at Muierilor Cave in the winter months the maximum number of bats recorded was 2830. Our observations indicate that in spite of frequent disturbance arising from speleotourism, Muierilor Cave is one of the biggest and most important bat hibernacula in Southern Carpathians.",

This study aimed to use high throughput screening to identify the viruses in fecal guano of Taiwanese insectivorous bats caves in order to obtain more information on bat-derived pathogenic viruses in East Asia. Guano samples were collected from two caves in Taiwan, pooled, and then subjected to Multiplex PCR-based next generation sequencing for viral identiﬁcation. Subsequently, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) sequence was detected and conﬁrmed by reverse transcription PCR. EMCV is considered as rodent virus and thus, animal species identiﬁcation through cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcoding was further done to identify the viral source. Finally, determination of distribution and veriﬁcation of the presence of EMCV in guano obtained from Japanese and South Korean caves was also done. We concluded that the guano collected was not contaminated with the excrement of rodents which were reported and presumed to live in Taiwan. Also, EMCV genome fragments were found in guanos of Japanese and South Korean caves. It is possible that the eastern bent-wing bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus) is one of the natural hosts of EMCV in East Asia.",

High risk activities at the bat-human interface pose the threat of zoonotic virus transmission. We present evidence for prior exposure of bat harvesters and two resident fruit bat species to filovirus surface glycoproteins by screening sera in a multiplexed serological assay. Antibodies reactive to two antigenically distinct filoviruses were detected in human sera and to three individual filoviruses in bats in remote Northeast India. Sera obtained from Eonycteris spelaea bats showed similar patterns of cross-reactivity as human samples, suggesting them as the species responsible for the spillover. In contrast, sera from Rousettus leschenaultii bats reacted to two different virus glycoproteins. Our results indicate circulation of several filoviruses in bats and the possibility for filovirus transmission from bats to humans.",

It lists nine new localities records, including the first from northern and peninsular Thailand, which represent a substantial increase in the species’ known range; it confirms the record from northern peninsular Malaysia. In addition, it provides further information on two other small species of the Hipposideros bicolor group, H. ater and H. cineraceus.",

The prevalence of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in this area is unknown; however, cases of human infection were previously confirmed near these collection sites. Samples were collected from 353 mammals (rodents, shrews, pangolins, elephant shrews, a potamogale, and a hyrax). Some rodents and shrews were captured from houses where human monkeypox cases have recently been identified, but most were trapped in forests and agricultural areas near villages. Real-time PCR and ELISA were used to assess evidence of MPXV infection and other Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) infections in these small mammals. Seven (2.0%) of these animal samples were found to be anti-orthopoxvirus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody positive (six rodents: two Funisciurus spp.; one Graphiurus lorraineus; one Cricetomys emini; one Heliosciurus sp.; one Oenomys hypoxanthus, and one elephant shrew Petrodromus tetradactylus); no individuals were found positive in PCR-based assays. These results suggest that a variety of animals can be infected with OPXVs, and that epidemiology studies and educational campaigns should focus on animals that people are regularly contacting, including larger rodents used as protein sources.",

A contribution to the debate on the nocturnal giant carnivore Nyctalus lasiopterus (Schreber, 1780) has raised doubts about the possibility of catching small passerine birds. Some authors hypothesize that the giant bat is condemned, by the low resolution of its ultrasonic impulse, to mistakenly catch floating feathers in the air. This contribution aims to highlight how the species effectively preys on small birds and the need to further investigate the intricacies of its trophic and predatory ecology.\n\nChirotteri ornitofagi mangiatori di penne? Un contributo al dibattito sulla carnivoria della nottolagigante. In un recente dibattito sulla carnivoria nella nottolagigante Nyctalus lasiopterus (Schreber, 1780) sono stati sollevati dubbi sulla possibilità di cattura di piccoli passeriformi. Alcuni autori ipotizzano che la nottolagigante sia condannata, dalla bassa risoluzione del suo impulso ultrasonoro, a catturare erroneamente penne fluttuanti nell'aria. Il presente contributo vuole evidenziare come la specie riesca a predare effettivamente piccoli uccelli e la necessità di approfondire molto degli aspetti legati alla sua ecologia trofica e predatoria.",

The content of the samples, collected in October and November of 1995 and in September and October of 1996 and 1997, consisted mainly of bird feathers identi®ed as those of the robin Erithacus rubecula and the blue tit Parus caeruleus. The presence of feathers during the 3 consecutive years of the study period con®rms that the diet of the greater noctule in this area is not based exclusively on arthropods as was previously suggested.",

            "abstractNote": "Effective prediction of future viral zoonoses requires an indepth understanding of the heterologous viral population in key animal species that will likely serve as reservoir hosts or intermediates during the next viral epidemic. The importance of bats as natural hosts for several important viral zoonoses, including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra, Rabies, and SARS-coronavirus, has been established; however, the large viral population diversity (virome) of bats has been partially determined for only a few of the ∼1200 bat species. To assess the virome of North American bats, we collected fecal, oral, urine, and tissue samples from individual bats captured at an abandoned railroad tunnel in Maryland that is cohabitated by seven to ten different bat species. Here we present preliminary characterization of the virome of three common North American bat species, including big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), and little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus). In samples derived from these bats, we identified viral sequences that were similar to at least three novel group 1 CoVs, large numbers of insect and plant virus sequences, and nearly full-length genomic sequences of two novel bacteriophages. These observations suggest that bats encounter and disseminate a large assortment of viruses capable of infecting many different animals, insects, and plants in nature.",

            "abstractNote": "The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Bats of several species in southern People's Republic of China harbor SARS-like CoVs and may be reservoir hosts for them. To determine whether bats in North America also harbor coronaviruses, we used reverse transcription-PCR to detect coronavirus RNA in bats. We found coronavirus RNA in 6 of 28 fecal specimens from bats of 2 of 7 species tested. The prevalence of viral RNA shedding was high: 17% in Eptesicus fuscus and 50% in Myotis occultus. Sequence analysis of a 440-bp amplicon in gene 1b showed that these Rocky Mountain bat coronaviruses formed 3 clusters in phylogenetic group 1 that were distinct from group 1 coronaviruses of Asian bats. Because of the potential for bat coronaviruses to cause disease in humans and animals, further surveillance and characterization of bat coronaviruses in North America are needed.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are reservoirs for several zoonotic pathogens of medical importance; however, infection dynamics of pathogens in wild bat populations remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the influence of host crowding and population age structure on pathogen transmission and diversity in bat populations. Focusing on two pathogen taxa of medical importance, Leptospira bacteria and paramyxoviruses, we monitored host population and pathogen shedding dynamics within a maternity colony of the tropical bat species Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Reunion Island. Our data reveal astonishingly similar infection dynamics for Leptospira and paramyxoviruses, with infection peaks during late pregnancy and 2 months after the initial birth pulse. Furthermore, although co-infection occurs frequently during the peaks of transmission, the patterns do not suggest any interaction between the two pathogens. Partial sequencing reveals a unique bat-specific Leptospira strain contrasting with the co-circulation of four separate paramyxovirus lineages along the whole breeding period. Patterns of infection highlight the importance of host crowding in pathogen transmission and suggest that most bats developed immune response and stop excreting pathogens. Our results support that bat maternity colonies may represent hot spots of transmission for bacterial and viral infectious agents, and highlight how seasonality can be an important determinant of host-parasite interactions and disease emergence.",

            "abstractNote": "In Brazil, rabies surveillance is based on monitoring domestic and wild animals, although the most prevalent lineage of the rabies virus (RABV) currently diagnosed in Brazil is associated with bats, particularly non-haematophagous bats. Disease control is based on the mass vaccination of dogs and cats. We used data collected by the passive surveillance system of the city of Campinas from 2011 to 2015, to describe the temporal and geographic distributions of the bat specimens and RABV and discuss the current rabies surveillance with the advent of the declaration of canine and feline rabies-free areas in Brazil. We described the species, locations and health statuses of the collected bat specimens. Moreover, all samples were submitted for RABV diagnosis. Then, we performed a time series decomposition for each bat family. Additionally, we determined the spatiotemporal relative risk for RABV infection using the ratio of the kernel-smoothed estimates of spatiotemporal densities of RABV-positive and RABV-negative bats. From the 2537 bat specimens, the most numerous family was Molossidae (72%), followed by Vespertilionidae (14%) and Phyllostomidae (13%). The bat families behaved differently in terms of seasonal and spatial patterns. The distribution of bats varied geographically in the urban environment, with Molossidae and Phyllostomidae being observed downtown and Vespertilionidae being observed in peripheral zones. Concurrently, a significant relative risk of RABV infection was observed downtown for Vespertilionidae and in peripheral zones for Molossidae. No RABV-positive sample clusters were observed. As a result of the official declaration of RABV-free areas in southern Brazil, mass dog and cat vaccinations are expected to halt in the near future. This stoppage would make most dog and cat populations susceptible to other RABV lineages, such as those maintained by non-haematophagous bats. In this scenario, all information available on bats and RABV distribution in urban areas is essential. Currently, few studies have been conducted. Some local health authorities, such as that in Campinas, are spontaneously basing their surveillance efforts on bat rabies, which is the alternative in reality scenario of increased susceptibility to bat-associated RABV that is developing in Brazil.",
