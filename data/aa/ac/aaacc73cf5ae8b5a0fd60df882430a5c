We therefore used individuals of Geoffroy’s bat Myotis emarginatus in a case study to test the hypothesis that these two methods yield similar data on growth rates and growth derivatives. We followed postnatal growth in body mass, forearm length, and total epiphyseal gap in 24 tagged neonates sampled 10 times (via 143 cases of longitudinal sampling) and compared finding with those deriving from cross-sectional sampling carried out on the same occasions among 138 non-tagged neonates of the same colony. A generalized estimating equation relating to the first 3 weeks of postnatal growth indicated that initial values (y-intercepts) for forearm length and body mass did not differ significantly between groups sampled in the two ways (P > 0.05), while rates of growth characterized by these parameters were found to differ significantly (P < 0.05). In relation to the length of total epiphyseal gap obtained for days 12–40, tests for equal intercepts and parallelism confirmed significant differences between the two sampling methods at P < 0.05. Specifically, cross-sectional sampling of the three growth parameters resulted in significant overestimation of ages among the studied bats. However, given the greater logistical challenges with longitudinal sampling, our demonstration of the relative value of the two sampling methods, and of their dependence for accuracy on the amount of variation found in growth variables, allows us to persist in advocating cross-sectional sampling in postnatal studies on bats.",

We therefore compared the cost efficiency and effectiveness of several standard methods to assess mammal diversity using camera traps, live traps, track plates, mist nets for bats, acoustic bat surveys, spotlight surveys, and block transects recording individual animals, scat, and tracks. We also assessed local knowledge through interviews. We surveyed on two contrasting arid ecosystems in South Africa. Our data indicated that block transects were the most cost-efficient and effective method at ascertaining terrestrial mammal species richness. Depending on the goal of the study and the area, a combination of block transects with camera traps or spotlight surveys is a viable option. However, our study indicated the best combination to detect species across different taxonomic groups was block transects and live traps. Local knowledge interviews can be a good addition to a survey as it assesses mammal diversity for longer time period and not just the survey season and it provides knowledge on species that are difficult to detect.",

Assumed large distributions of both species and habitats have probably discouraged studies correlating altered landscapes’ structure and composition to patterns of genetic diversity in the Neotropics. Yet, considering the increasingly high rates of deforestation and habitat conversion in Amazonia, investigating local and regional-scale effects of habitat conversion on Amazonian mammals is of paramount importance. Here, we use widespread, non-threatened, phyllostomid bats to understand how current forest dynamics are influencing genetic diversity patterns and functional connectivity of eastern Amazonian volant mammals. Four frugivorous species, Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Dermanura gnoma and Artibeus obscurus, were sampled across a heterogeneously fragmented region. Twelve more or less isolated rainforest remnants surrounded by urban areas, pastures, crops, secondary forests and other land uses comprise the studied landscapes, and are compared using a landscape genetics approach applied to mitochondrial DNA loci. Here, we report species-specific consequences of habitat fragmentation. Although the overall levels of genetic diversity were high, our data show that (i) population structure is heterogeneous across the altered landscapes; (ii) landscapes with higher habitat availability harbour populations with higher genetic diversity; and (iii) the populations assessed might be demographically declining.",

Their availability affects both the geographic occurrence and the diversity of bat communities. Hence, understanding how bats use roosts and variables that influence these patterns could contribute to the development of management plans to ensure their survival. In this study, species distribution modeling of two bat species, the greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum) and the small mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma muscatellum), were carried out using the sdm package in R. To do so, 16 environmental variables were used as the predictors to explore their relationships with the occurrence of the two species using 12 modeling algorithms. The prediction models for each species were then combined into an ensemble model. The random forest modeling algorithm showed better performance than the other individual models in this modeling. Moreover, the prediction performance of the ensemble model was more substantial than all the individual models for both species. For the greater mousetailed bat, elevation, annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, and distance to roads-railways were identified as the essential variables for summer roosting habitat selection. Meanwhile, distance to roads-railways, annual mean temperature, elevation, and distance to the ridge were significant for the small mouse-tailed bat. Since this study facilitates the management of future and suitable habitats by identifying important environmental conditions, it can be used in conservation plans.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats exhibit food preferences for specific attributes in their prey. Hardness has been defined as an important prey attribute, and in some cases a limiting factor in foraging decisions for smaller compared to larger bat species. The goal of this study was to identify which factors influence the selection of prey hardness in a vespertilionid bat community. We investigated food consumed by bats by analyzing fecal samples obtained from eight bat species coexisting in a mountain ecosystem of central Mexico and correlate non-phylogenetically and phylogenetically prey hardness to weather, bat´s body, cranial and ultrasonic call structure variables. Results showed that diet of vespertilionid bats was mainly represented by Diptera, Neuroptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera consumption. The qualitative prey hardness index (From soft 1 to hard 5) ranked bats as: Myotis melanorhinus, Corynorhinus mexicanus, Myotis volans, Myotis californicus (< 3); Myotis velifer (< 4); Eptesicus fuscus, Idionycteris phyllotis and Myotis thysanodes (> 4.2). Prey hardness was positively correlated to minimum and mean temperatures, bat´s body weight, total and forearm lengths, cranial variables as: zygomatic breadth, mandibular length, height of the coronoid process, lower molar width, C-M3 superior and inferior rows length and upper molar width; and negatively to ultrasonic variables as total slope, call duration, low and high frequencies, band width and frequency maximum power. Considering phylogenies, prey hardness positively correlated to mandibular length, C-M3 inferior and superior rows lengths (p < 0.05). Our results showed that environmental, morphological and echolocation variables can be used as predictors of preferred insect prey in a community of vespertilionid bats.",

Yet, little is known about their ecology in montane ecosystems embedded in the tropics. We estimated the activity patterns and species richness throughout the year in three habitats of insectivorous bats in a montane ecosystem of central Mexico. To our knowledge, this is the first acoustic monitoring that has been conducted in a mountainous region in central Mexico and the second one conducted in a mountain embedded in America. We recorded 491 bat passes belonging to ten species of the families Vespertilionidae, Mormoopidae, and Molossidae. Four species accounted for 91% of the total activity registered: Myotis volans, M. velifer, M. californicus, and Eptesicus fuscus. Overall activity depended on the time of night, month, habitat, and season. Species composition of the community assemblage of bats among the different habitats was similar, indicating that many individuals would make movements along the habitats present at the mountain. These differences were probably driven by bats exploiting prey availability, which could be determined by the environmental factors present at the different habitats of the park. In this work, some important species were not detected by the acoustic monitoring, indicating that bat captures would complement acoustic surveys and provide a more comprehensive overview of species composition and richness.",

            "abstractNote": "The diet of Rhinolophus euryale was studied in southeastern Slovakia by an analysis of faeces collected from netted bats. Prey availability was studied using light traps, counting flying insects on the transect, and sweeping the vegetation. The diet composition was dominated by Lepidoptera, especially in July and September, which corresponds with most diet analyses reporting the species as a Lepidopteran specialist. Nonflying arthropods were almost absent from the diet, suggesting that the species obtains most of its food mainly by aerial hawking. The spring diet showed unusually high volumes of Diptera; this differed significantly from the evidence from its core distribution area in the Mediterranean. This suggests a higher flexibility of the trophic niche in the marginal parts of the species range. Our results suggest sex differences in diet. Possible conservation measures for these marginal populations should consider the protection of diverse mosaic landscapes, including urbanised patches. Such areas with long, warm interfaces of open and bushy and/or forest habitats have high moth flying activity, and riparian patches provide dipteran prey in spring when moths are scarce. The prediction of the prosperity of the studied northernmost populations of R. euryale during the ongoing climate change is ambiguous since various conceivable scenarios could work: (i) good prosperity of the population thanks to a warmer climate, higher production and higher flying activity of prey, or (ii) a worse situation due to unevenly distributed precipitation and higher evaporation, which may negatively affect wet habitats providing the important spring diet of tipulid dipterans.",

            "abstractNote": "In Argentine Patagonia, three species of long-eared brown bats coexist, Histiotus macrotus, H. magellanicus, and H. montanus, which differ by ear length and other characters. Considering that pinna and tragus size and morphology may affect the perception of incoming echoes, we expected that differences in ear morphometry across species would match with interspecific variation in echolocation call structure. We studied echolocation calls of these species, recording calls of free-ranging Histiotus in eight localities from Chubut province (Argentina). We measured morphometric variables (mass, length of ear and tragus, forearm) in captured specimens. We analyzed eight acoustic parameters in 4020 recorded pulses (H. macrotus n = 2020, H. magellanicus n = 1409, and H. montanus n = 591). Principal components (PCA) and discriminant analyses (DFA) revealed that these species clearly segregate in acoustic space, consistent with interspecific differences in ear morphology. Comparatively, H. magellanicus with shorter ears (< 25 mm) emitted higher-frequency calls at short time intervals; by contrast, H. macrotus and H. montanus with longer ears (> 27 mm) emitted lower-frequency calls, in turn differentiating from each other by inter-pulse intervals. MANOVA indicated that these differences were highly significant. Redundancy analysis showed a strong correlation between ear and tragus length and acoustic structure. Our results suggest that these Histiotus species are distinguishable in terms of their bioacoustics, which likely have a functional basis linked to morphological variation of sensory organs.",

Advances in molecular genetic tools enable this, even for cryptic species complexes that are often morphologically confusing or indistinguishable. However, the costs of these methods and sequencing remain prohibitive for many researchers, particularly in less developed regions. The aim of this study was to test whether ISSR-PCR markers can be used to distinguish three similar horseshoe bat species that are often misidentified and occur in sympatry in Serbia. Samples from 64 Rhinolophus euryale, R. blasii, and R. mehelyi bats were identified using this ISSR-PCR approach, and species identifications were additionally confirmed by sequencing D-loop fragment of mitochondrial DNA. ISSR-PCR yielded species-specific band patterns on the agarose gel that allowed the differentiation of three medium-sized horseshoe bat species. This approach does not require sequencing, making it a quick and inexpensive tool for the genetic identification of these species, and complements already existing methods. There is potential to scale up this method to other cryptic species complexes, reducing misidentifications that lead to inaccurate population trend assessments and have knock-on effects on our ability to monitor and conserve wildlife, especially rare and endangered species.",

Most species are Afrotropical with a substantial number Saharo-Sindian. Palaearctic and more ubiquitous elements are well represented. Examination of species restricted to the region shows Afrotropical species to be most numerous in the Yemens followed by Saudi Arabia. Oman has the best representation of Palaearctic species. There is appreciable endemism within the region. The history of the region and surrounding area has been examined for the past 100000 years. For much of this time the Arabian Peninsula has experiencedconsiderablearidity apart from about 35 000-17 000 BP and 11000-6000 BP. World sea levels have fluctuated, probably between - 105 and - 175 m below present levels. Such falls would have facilitated narrow water barriers or land connections between Africa and Arabia. This is supported by historical studies on the palaeofauna, particularly of Israel, which indicate periods of faunal movement into the area from Africa and elsewhere. The significanceof the faunal structure is discussedin the light of the historical information. There have probably been influxes into southern Arabia from Africa and the north at times of low sea levels; the penetration Df some Afrotropical elements has probably also occurred via Sinai. Penetrations from the west include some of the more widespread species as well as most of the Saharo-Sindian elements. These conclusions find broad support from the biogeography of birds, freshwater fish, butterflies and plants.",

The lack of a globally accepted list of English-language names for mammal species leads to various problems stemming from the reduced ability to communicate unambiguously. This impacts directly on their conservation. We use the larger mammals of Indochina to exemplify the use of an explicit set of principles designed to provide each species with a unique and non-misleading (or at least minimally so) English name. 2. For most species, a suitable name is already in use, sometimes generally so. For species for which multiple names are in use, standardization would consist of adopting the most suitable name. Only for a very few species are all extant names so unsuitable that a neologism should be coined. One species, Panthera pardus, presents potentially insoluble problems. 3. Name standardization among the world’s birds has generated some controversy, but this has not led to abandonment of the process. Much can be learned by those developing a similar process for mammals, through studying the bird-naming process. Progress can be advanced by detractors indicating whether they oppose standardization per se, the principles used or the names resulting from application of the principles. Also, proponents of standardization should always emphasize that the purpose of the process is to produce a list available for those who want to use it, not to produce a binding selection that must be used in all circumstances.",

It now directly assists British conservation science, and has fostered The British Deer Society, the National Federation of Badger Groups, The Bat Conservation Trust, the Ungulate Research Group and Sea Watch Foundation. The Society also has strong links with the Zoological Society of London, the Vincent Wildlife Trust and the People’s Trust for Endangered Species/Mammals Trust UK, as well as with many other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and statutory bodies. 2. The Mammal Society provides fora for discussion, scientiﬁc symposia, mammal publications, and practical studies. It has also instigated major advances in the presentation of scientiﬁc knowledge through three editions of The Handbook of British Mammals under three successive editors: H.N. Southern, G.B. Corbet and S. Harris. 3. From the 1970s the Society has highlighted conservation concerns (e.g. the decline of otters and persecution and management of badgers), informed legislation, supported many surveys, including harvest mice, pine marten, polecat, small rodents, hares, yellow-necked mice and foxes, and published authoritative species’ accounts, guides to methodology, Mammal Review, Notes/Communications from The Mammal Society, the annual Current Projects on British Mammals and other scientiﬁc and educational material. 4. Country-wide mammal recording and training (Look Out for Mammals) developed in the 1990s alongside the Endangered British Mammals Fund. The ‘ground breaking’ A Red Data Book for British Mammals, and A Review of British Mammals, both drew on Mammal Society expertise, helping to meet the UK Government’s conservation responsibilities and emphasizing the growing inﬂuence of The Society. Co-operative monitoring has been developed with the British Trust for Ornithology through the Winter Mammal Monitoring scheme and is further projected with more than 20 NGOs and statutory bodies forming the ‘Tracking Mammals Partnership’. 5. The Mammal Society now advises on UK Biodiversity Action Plans and plays a lead role in UK mammal conservation, highlighting problems and promoting solutions. However, many British mammals are still declining, many are neither legally protected nor subject to national conservation initiatives, and data are still lacking on the status of many terrestrial and most marine species. Much has been done, but there is still much to do.",

If an animal is better informed, it should then be better able to adjust its behaviour and reduce the uncertainty of finding food in a variable world.\n                \n                \n                  Given the remarkable range of social systems and ecological niches of bats throughout the world, bats are well‐suited as a model to review mechanisms and fitness consequences of information transfer about food. The aim of this manuscript was to conduct a systematic literature review for mechanisms for information transfer and their potential fitness consequences for bats.\n                \n                \n                  Information transfer behaviour is found in bats under various ecological conditions, including in groups of males in temperate regions, in groups of males or females in subtropical regions, and in mixed groups in tropical regions. Bats can learn about food indirectly, for example via chemical cues carried by the breath and body of frugivorous bats, or via acoustic cues from feeding buzzes from insectivorous bats. The majority of playback studies in captivity and in the wild showed stronger intra‐specific and inter‐specific attraction of bats to feeding buzzes than to silence controls or to search phase calls. Bats can also transfer information directly, via signals intended to attract, to repel or even to jam the echolocation of conspecifics.\n                \n                \n                  Social foraging in bats can be categorised as local enhancement, information‐centre hypothesis, group foraging or food sharing, depending on the type of information transfer and the food sources used. Fitness consequences of information transfer from the actor's and the recipient's perspective remain poorly investigated to date. Recent studies in insectivorous bats suggest a balance of benefits from prey searching and costs of acoustic interference that may condition group size.\n                \n                \n                  The future use of a wide array of methods promises to reveal exciting insights about mechanisms and fitness consequences of information transfer by bats about food.",

Although Phyllostomidae species are known to use more types of roosts than any other chiropteran lineage, foliage roosting is almost entirely restricted to the frugivorous members of the subfamily Stenodermatinae. There are relatively few studies on the roosting ecology of stenodermatines other than leaf tent users, and there have been few attempts to reconstruct the evolution of the peculiar foliage‐roosting habits of these fruit bats.\n                \n                \n                  Our aim was to reconstruct the evolution of foliage roosting in the Phyllostomidae phylogeny, and to test correlation hypotheses between roost types, pelage markings, and body size.\n                \n                \n                  We performed ancestral character reconstructions using stochastic mappings on a molecular phylogeny of Phyllostomidae and reviewed literature records on roosts used by Stenodermatinae. Correlations between roosting habits and pelage patterns were calculated using phylogenetic logistic regressions.\n                \n                \n                  Over 1200 records of roost use for 48 Stenodermatinae bat species were found in the literature. Most of the observations consisted of foliage roosting records; the second most common type of roost were caves and crevices, which was followed by holes in standing trees.\n                \n                \n                  Our results support a single origin of foliage roosting in Phyllostomidae, which we interpreted as a synapomorphy uniting Rhinophyllinae with the Stenodermatinae. We estimated a minimum of two origins of tent roosting within Phyllostomidae, and our reconstruction suggests that it was basal in the Rhinophyllinae + Stenodermatinae clade.\n                \n                \n                  Pelage markings of stenodermatines explained the type of roost, indicating that having white stripes or white spots contrasting with background pelage is related to foliage roosting. Species that use leaf tents are smaller than ones that do not, but group size does not appear to be correlated with tent use.\n                \n                \n                  Further studies of foliage‐roosting bat species that do not use leaf tents may shed light on the mode of evolution of this complex behavioural character.",

These are important considerations for airport operators that are obliged to mitigate wildlife hazards at airfields. Incidents involving mammals account for approximately 3–10% of all recorded strikes. However, relatively little research has been conducted on mammal strikes with aircraft outside of the USA.\n                \n                \n                  We collate mammal strike data from six major national aviation authorities and a global aircraft database and review the available scientific and grey literature. We aim to identify which mammal families are involved in strike events and how widespread the issue is on a global scale. We also aim to demonstrate the importance of consistently recording strike instances in national databases.\n                \n                \n                  We identified 40 families that were involved in strike events in 47 countries. Reported mammal strike events have been increasing by up to 68% annually. Chiroptera (4 families) accounted for the greatest proportion of strikes in Australia; leporids and canids in Canada, Germany and the UK; and Chiroptera (5 families) and cervids in the USA. More mammals were struck during the landing phase of an aircraft's rotation than any other phase. Circa‐diel strike risk was greatest at dusk and circa‐annum strike risk was greatest during late summer, with some international variation. The total estimated cost of damage resulting from reported mammal strikes exceeded US$103 million in the USA alone, over 30 years.\n                \n                \n                  Mammal strikes represent a substantial risk in airfield environments. Monitoring of existing wild mammal populations is required to understand temporal trends in presence, abundance, and activity patterns and to inform management decisions. Increased and accurate reporting of strike events globally is needed to inform Wildlife Hazard Management Plans and support effective strike mitigation.\n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            RESUMÉ EN FRANÇAIS\n            \n              \n                \n                  La fréquence des collisions entre avions et animaux sauvages connait une augmentation constante à travers le monde, entrainant des conséquences pour la sécurité du personnel et des passagers ainsi que pour l'économie de l'industrie aéronautique. Il s'agit d’une considération importante pour les exploitants d'aéroports qui sont tenus d'atténuer les risques potentiels liés à la faune sauvage sur les terrains d'aviation. Les incidents impliquant des mammifères représentent environ 3 à 10 % des collisions enregistrées. Cependant, en dehors des États‐Unis, relativement peu de recherches ont été menées sur les collisions entre mammifères et avions.\n                \n                \n                  Nous rassemblons les données sur les collisions avec des mammifères provenant de six directions nationales majeures de l’aviation civile ainsi que d'une base de données mondiale sur les aéronefs et compulsons l’ensemble de la littérature scientifique et grise disponible. Notre objectif est d’identifier les familles de mammifères impliquées dans les collisions et de déterminer l'ampleur du phénomène à l'échelle mondiale. Parallèlement, nous cherchons à démontrer l'importance de l’enregistrement systématique des cas de collisions dans les bases de données nationales.\n                \n                \n                  Nous avons identifié 40 familles de mammifères impliquées dans des collisions dans 47 pays, avec une forte augmentation des collisions signalées, pouvant aller jusqu'à 68% par an. Les chiroptères (4 familles) représentaient la plus grande proportion des collisions en Australie, au Canada, en Allemagne et au Royaume‐Uni ce sont les léporidés et les canidés qui sont le plus souvent impliqués, et aux États‐Unis, les chiroptères (5 familles) et les cervidés. Plus qu’à toute autre phase, c’est pendant la phase d'atterrissage que le nombre d’impacts le plus importants se produit. Au cours de la journée, le risque d'impact est le plus élevé au crépuscule et il connait un pic annuel à la fin de l'été et en automne, avec cependant quelques variations internationales. Sur une période de 30 ans, le coût estimé des dommages résultant des collisions signalées avec des mammifères dépasse les 103 millions de dollars US rien qu'aux États‐Unis.\n                \n                \n                  Les collisions impliquant un mammifère représentent un risque environnemental élevé pour les aéroports, tant pour l’intégrité des avions que pour la sécurité des passagers. L’évaluation des populations de mammifères sauvages aux abords des aéroports est nécessaire pour prédire les évolutions temporelles de présence, d'abondance et d’activité de ces populations. Les études permettent d'accompagner les opérateurs d’aéroports dans la prise de décision liées à la prévention des risques naturels. A l'échelle mondiale, il est nécessaire de disposer de rapports plus nombreux et plus détaillés sur les cas de collisions afin d’enrichir les stratégies de gestion des risques animaliers et de réduire efficacement le nombre de collisions.",

Fortunately, there are some signs of recovery; for instance, of the 11 species monitored in the UK, population trends of five are increasing. The drivers of past losses and recent trends are unclear; identifying them will enable targeted conservation strategies to support further recovery.\n                \n                \n                  We review the evidence linking proposed drivers to impacts on bat populations in Europe, using the results of a previous cross‐taxa semi‐quantitative assessment as a framework. Broadly, the drivers reviewed relate to land‐use practices, climate change, pollution, development and infrastructure, and human disturbance. We highlight where evidence gaps or conflicts present barriers to successful conservation and review emerging opportunities to address these gaps.\n                \n                \n                  We find that the relative importance or impacts of the potential drivers of bat population change are not well understood or quantified, with conflicting evidence in many cases. To close key gaps in the evidence for responses of bat populations to environmental change, future studies should focus on the impacts of climate change, urbanisation, offshore wind turbines, and water pollution, as well as on mitigation measures and the synergistic effects of putative drivers.\n                \n                \n                  To increase available evidence of drivers of bat population change, we propose utilising advances in monitoring tools and statistical methods, together with robust quantitative assessment of conservation interventions to mitigate threats and enable the effective conservation of these protected species.",

This highly radiated group embodies many distinct ecomorphological traits, prompting their functional diversity. Furthermore, bat assemblages typically have high beta‐diversity due to distinctive compositions across geographic gradients.\n                \n                \n                  We aimed to understand the distribution of multifaceted bat diversity metrics (i.e. species richness, functional richness, Rao’s quadratic entropy, and local contribution to beta‐diversity) as a function of land‐cover variables, environmental productivity and complexity, and anthropogenic features in the largest Tropical country worldwide: Brazil.\n                \n                \n                  We gathered data on bat distribution based on empirical published datasets and embodied the assemblages at the metacommunity scale, based on 10‐km radial clusters. We obtained spatial data on land cover, gross primary production, vegetation height, and human population density for the same radial clusters. We analysed the data via diversity metrics, descriptive statistics, and generalised additive models.\n                \n                \n                  Our results showed that two main metaregions (central‐western Amazon and the Atlantic coast) embrace the largest richness of bat species. The major positive predictor of bat diversity metrics was vegetation height. Bat diversity metrics throughout Brazil were also significantly influenced by agriculture (negatively) and urban cover (partially positively).\n                \n                \n                  We can conclude that bat diversity is more predictable from vegetation height and landscape features – especially agriculture and urban cover – at the metacommunity scale, whereas functional and local contributions to beta‐diversity metrics are more predictable from spatial autocorrelations, with some biome‐induced constrained effects. For the conservation of Brazilian bats and the many ecosystem services they provide, it is absolutely essential to prevent the further collapse of Brazilian biomes that is currently ongoing and fuelled by landscape changes, expansion of agribusiness frontiers, deforestation, and fires.\n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            RESUMO EM PORTUGUÊS\n            \n              \n                \n                  Os morcegos são um dos grupos de mamíferos mais ricos em espécies nos trópicos. Este grupo altamente radiado incorpora muitos e distintos traços ecomorfológicos, incrementando sua diversidade funcional. Além disso, as assembleias de morcegos normalmente têm alta diversidade beta devido a composições distintas ao longo dos gradientes geográficos.\n                \n                \n                  Nosso objetivo foi compreender a distribuição de índices de diversidade de morcegos (i.e. riqueza de espécies, riqueza funcional, entropia quadrática de Rao e contribuição local para a diversidade beta) em função de variáveis de uso e cobertura do solo, produtividade e complexidade ambiental e de características antropogênicas no maior país tropical do mundo: o Brasil.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Reunimos dados sobre a distribuição de morcegos com base em conjuntos de dados empíricos já publicados e incorporamos as assembleias em escala de metacomunidades, com base em aglomerados radiais (\n                    buffers\n                    ) de 10 km. Obtivemos dados espaciais sobre cobertura do solo, produção primária bruta, altura da vegetação e densidade da população humana para os mesmos\n                    buffers\n                    . Analisamos os dados por meio de métricas de diversidade, estatísticas descritivas e modelos aditivos generalizados.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Nossos resultados mostraram que duas meta‐regiões (Amazônia central‐ocidental e costa atlântica) incorporam a maior riqueza de espécies de morcegos. O principal preditor positivo das métricas de diversidade de morcegos foi a altura da vegetação. As métricas de diversidade de morcegos em todo o Brasil também foram significativamente influenciadas pela agricultura (negativamente) e cobertura urbana (parcialmente positiva).\n                \n                \n                  Podemos concluir que a diversidade de morcegos na escala da metacomunidade é mais previsível a partir da altura da vegetação e características da paisagem — especialmente agricultura e cobertura urbana —, enquanto as contribuições funcionais e locais para métricas de diversidade beta são mais previsíveis por autocorrelações espaciais, tendo efeitos induzidos pelos diferentes biomas. Para a conservação dos morcegos no Brasil — e os muitos serviços ecossistêmicos que eles fornecem — é absolutamente essencial prevenir um colapso ainda maior do que já vem ocorrendo atualmente nos biomas brasileiros, e que é fortemente alimentado por mudanças na paisagem, expansão das fronteiras do agronegócio, desmatamento e incêndios.",

The development and growth of global species’ trait databases are critical for improving trait‐based analyses; however, it is vital to understand the gaps and biases in the available data.\n                \n                \n                  We reviewed bat wing morphology data, specifically mass, wingspan, wing area, wing loading, and aspect ratio, to identify issues with data reporting and ambiguity. Additionally, we aimed to assess taxonomic and geographic biases in trait data coverage.\n                \n                \n                  We found that most studies used similar field methodology, but that data reporting and quality were inconsistent/poor. Additionally, we noted several issues regarding semantic ambiguity in trait definitions, specifically around what constitutes wing area.\n                \n                \n                  Globally, we found that bat wing morphology trait coverage was low. Only six bat families had ≥40% trait coverage, and, of those, none consisted of more than 11 species in total. We found similar biases in trait coverage across International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categories, with threatened species having lower coverage.\n                \n                \n                  Geographically, North America, Europe, and the Indomalayan regions exhibited higher overall trait coverage, while both the Afrotropical and Neotropical ecoregions showed poor trait coverage.\n                \n                \n                  The underlying biases and gaps in bat wing morphology data have implications for researchers conducting global trait‐based assessments. Implementing imputation techniques may address missing data, but only for smaller regional subsets with substantial trait coverage.\n                \n                \n                  Due to generally low overall trait coverage, increasing species’ representation in the database should be prioritised. We suggest adopting an Ecological Trait Standard Vocabulary to reduce semantic ambiguity in bat wing morphology traits, to improve data compilation and clarity. Additionally, we advocate that researchers adopt an Open Science approach to facilitate the growth of a bat wing morphology trait database.",
