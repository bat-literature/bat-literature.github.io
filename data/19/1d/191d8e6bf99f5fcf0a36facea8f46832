However, it is unknown which emission sources drive this disparity and whether differences exist by emission sector, geography, or demographics. Quantifying the PM\n              2.5\n              exposure caused by each emitter type, we show that nearly all major emission categories—consistently across states, urban and rural areas, income levels, and exposure levels—contribute to the systemic PM\n              2.5\n              exposure disparity experienced by people of color. We identify the most inequitable emission source types by state and city, thereby highlighting potential opportunities for addressing this persistent environmental inequity.",

Therefore, the four-year LIFE Nature programme \"Conservation of three cave-dwelling bats in Southern France\" included an autoecological study of Miniopterus schreibersii, a highly gregarious cave-dwelling species. In a colony of 3-5,000 adults, 21 females were radio-tracked during pregnancy and lactating periods, when some of them switched roosts within a 30 km radius around the maternity colony. Every night, for about 6 hours, each bat flew far from the roost (4.1 to 29.2 km) to forage on several small feeding areas (1 to 9 over a few nights). Mean individual home-range estimation averaged 10837 ha for pregnant females, 22318 ha for lactating females. Urban areas lighted by white street lamps were used extensively. Some bats also foraged selectively in deciduous or mixed woodlands and in orchards and parks. The importance of hedgerows was confirmed. Conservation of M. schreibersii must be planned at a large scale, protecting a network of roosts and promoting nature-friendly agricultural practices.",

            "abstractNote": "Like other small terrestrial mammals, bats have a high mass-speciﬁc energetic demand because of the fact that they have an unfavorable surface area to volume ratio. Furthermore, bats have a very energy-expensive mode of locomotion: ﬂight. This high energetic demand has to be covered by food intake. The retention time of the digestive tract is one factor affecting the energy intake of bat species. Factors like energy demand, gut volume and dietary specialization inﬂuence retention time in mammals. However, maximum retention time for only Myotis myotis and transit time only for M. lucifugus, Nyctophilius gloudi and Nyctalus noctula is known. This study investigated the maximum retention times and transit times of 10 Central European bat species. It was hypothesized that the level of specialization of the digestive tract, energy-demanding processes and intestine length would affect the retention time of bats. Fluorescence-marked mealworms Tenebrio molitor were used to measure the time between the ﬁrst ingested mealworm and the ﬁrst appearance of the marker or the last ﬂuorescing feces, respectively. For the ﬁrst time, the retention time of 10 insectivorous bat species was measured to determine interspeciﬁc differences. Additionally, we measured the retention time of post-lactating female and spermatogenically active male Pipistrellus pipistrellus to determine intraspeciﬁc differences. The retention time of bats differed signiﬁcantly between species and is probably inﬂuenced by the level of specialization of the digestive tract. High-level specialization of the digestive tract resulted in short retention times. Furthermore, signiﬁcant intraspeciﬁc differences between postlactating and spermatogenically active individuals of P. pipistrellus showed that the retention time within a single species might be inﬂuenced by energy-demanding processes (e.g. reproduction).",

Here we describe the development and application of models to predict habitat use of a common insectivorous bat (Eptesicus fuscus) based upon δ13C and δ15N signatures of skin tissue. We used a 42-specimen sample collected from three well-characterized ecogeographic regions, disparate both in photosynthetic mechanism and fertilizer use, to generate the models. Significant univariate differences between these three sites in terms of δ13C (F2, 39 = 112.92, P < 0.0001) and δ15N (F2, 39 = 97.06, P < 0.0001), and multivariate significance of both variables (Wilk’s λ = 0.032, F4, 76 = 87.02, P < 0.0001), made it possible to develop three predictive models using Fisher’s linear discriminant functions: 1) a model predicting if bats forage in C3 or mixed C3/C4 sites, 2) a model predicting if bats forage in agricultural areas, and 3) a combined model using both variables to predict specific habitat use. We present the results of model application to an independent dataset of 329 bats sampled from 10 states that included a broad range of δ13C (-26.53‰ ≤ δ13C ≤ -17.20‰) and δ15N (6.36‰ ≤ δ15N ≤ 15.60‰) signatures. We validated the use of skin tissue samples (from wing membranes) in the model by comparing the sites used for model development across five tissue types, selecting skin samples for model development due to consistently low variance within this tissue type. Our results indicate nonspecific habitat-use by big brown bats.",

We reconsider this idea by means of detailed phylogenetic analyses of sequence data available for the Filoviridae: using coalescent simulations, we ascertain that two Marburg isolates (termed the “RAVN” strain) represent a quite-distinct lineage that should be considered in studies of biogeography and host associations, and may merit recognition at the level of species. In contrast, ﬁlovirus isolates recently obtained from bat tissues are not distinct from previously known strains, and should be considered as drawn from the same population. Implications for understanding the transmission geography and host associations of these viruses are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Resource exploitation and competition for food are important selective pressures in animal evolution. A number of recent investigations have focused on linkages between diversiﬁcation, trophic morphology and diet in bats, partly because their roosting habits mean that for many bat species diet can be quantiﬁed relatively easily through faecal analysis. Dietary analysis in mammals is otherwise invasive, complicated, time consuming and expensive. Here we present evidence from insectivorous bats that analysis of three-dimensional (3-D) textures of tooth microwear using International Organization for Standardization (ISO) roughness parameters derived from sub-micron surface data provides an additional, powerful tool for investigation of trophic resource exploitation in mammals. Our approach, like scale-sensitive fractal analysis, offers considerable advantages over twodimensional (2-D) methods of microwear analysis, including improvements in robustness, repeatability and comparability of studies. Our results constitute the ﬁrst analysis of microwear textures in carnivorous mammals based on ISO roughness parameters. They demonstrate that the method is capable of dietary discrimination, even between cryptic species with subtly different diets within trophic guilds, and even when sample sizes are small. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in microwear textures between insectivore species whose diet contains different proportions of ‘hard’ prey (such as beetles) and ‘soft’ prey (such as moths), and multivariate analyses are able to distinguish between species with different diets based solely on their tooth microwear textures. Our results show that, compared with previous 2-D analyses of microwear in bats, ISO roughness parameters provide a much more sophisticated characterization of the nature of microwear surfaces and can yield more robust and subtle dietary discrimination. ISO-based textural analysis of tooth microwear thus has a useful role to play, complementing existing approaches, in trophic analysis of mammals, both extant and extinct.",

Studies conducted in bats as a model system assume that shared evolutionary history has a maximum effect on the traits. However, this effect has not been quantiﬁed. In addition, the effect of levels of diet specialization on brain size remains unclear. We examined the role of diet on the evolution of brain size in Mormoopidae and Phyllostomidae using two comparative methods. Body mass explained 89% of the variance in brain volume. The effect of feeding behaviour (either characterized as feeding habits, as levels of specialization on a type of item or as handling behaviour) on brain volume was also signiﬁcant albeit not consistent after controlling for body mass and the strength of the phylogenetic signal (k). Although the strength of the phylogenetic signal of brain volume and body mass was high when tested individually, k values in phylogenetic generalized least squares models were signiﬁcantly different from 1. This suggests that phylogenetic independent contrasts models are not always the best approach for the study of ecological correlates of brain size in New World bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Heterogeneous pathogenic stress can shape major histocompatibility complex (MHC) diversity by influencing the functional plasticity of the immune response. Therefore, MHC diversity could reflect environmental stress, demonstrating its importance in uncovering the mechanisms of adaptive genetic variation. In this study, we combined neutral microsatellite loci, an immune-­related MHC II-­DRB locus, and climatic factors to unravel the mechanisms affecting the diversity and genetic differentiation of MHC genes in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), a species with a wide geographical distribution that has three distinct genetic lineages in China. First, increased genetic differentiation at the MHC locus among populations compared using microsatellites indicated diversifying selection. Second, the genetic differentiation of MHC and microsatellites were significantly correlated, suggesting that demographic processes exist. However, MHC genetic differentiation was significantly correlated with geographical distance among populations, even after controlling for the neutral markers, suggesting a major effect of selection. Third, although the MHC genetic differentiation was larger than that for microsatellites, there was no significant difference in the genetic differentiation between the two markers among genetic lineages, indicating the effect of balancing selection. Fourth, combined with climatic factors, MHC diversity and supertypes showed significant correlations with temperature and precipitation, but not with the phylogeographic structure of R. ferrumequinum, suggesting an effect of local adaptation driven by climate on MHC diversity. Moreover, the number of MHC supertypes varied between populations and lineages, suggesting regional characteristics and support for local adaptation. Taken together, the results of our study provide insights into the adaptive evolutionary driving forces at different geographic scales in R. ferrumequinum. In addition, climate factors may have played a vital role in driving adaptive evolution in this species.",

The African naked mole-rat (\n              Heterocephalus glaber\n              ) and hibernating mammals share similar environments and physiological features. In the naked mole-rat, acid insensitivity has been shown to be conferred by the functional motif of the sodium ion channel Na\n              V\n              1.7. There is now an opportunity to evaluate acid insensitivity in other taxa. In this study, we tested for functional convergence of Na\n              V\n              1.7 in 71 species of mammals, including 22 species that hibernate. Our analyses revealed a functional convergence of amino acid sequences, which occurred at least six times independently in mammals that hibernate. Evolutionary analyses determined that the convergence results from both parallel and divergent evolution of residues in the functional motif. Our findings not only identify the functional molecules responsible for acid insensitivity in hibernating mammals, but also open new avenues to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of acid insensitivity in mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "The east-coast free-tailed bat Mormopterus norfolkensis Gray, 1839 is a threatened insectivorous bat that is poorly known and as such conservation management strategies are only broadly prescribed. Insectivorous bats that use human-modiﬁed landscapes are often adapted to foraging in open microhabitats. However, few studies have explored whether open-adapted bats select landscapes with more of these microhabitat features.We compared three morphologically similar and sympatric, molossid bats (genus Mormopterus) with different conservation status in terms of their association with vegetation, climate, landform and land-use attributes at landscape and local habitat element scales.We predicted that these species would use similar landscape types, with semi-cleared and low density urban landscapes used more than forested and heavily cleared landscapes. Additionally, we explored which environmental variables best explained the occurrence of each species by constructing post-hoc models and habitat suitability maps. Contrary to predictions, we found that the three species varied in their habitat use with no one landscape type used more extensively than other types. Overall, M. norfolkensis was more likely to occur in low-lying, non-urban, riparian habitats with little vegetation cover. Mormopterus species 2 occupied similar habitats, but was more tolerant of urban landscapes. In contrast, Mormopterus species 4 occurred more often in cleared than forested landscapes, particularly dry landscapes with little vegetation cover.The extensive use of coastal ﬂoodplains by the threatened M. norfolkensis is signiﬁcant because these habitats are under increasing pressure from human land-uses and the predicted increase in urbanization is likely to further reduce the amount of suitable habitat.",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat loss and resultant fragmentation are major threats to biodiversity, particularly in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. It is increasingly urgent to understand fragmentation effects, which are often complex and vary across taxa, time and space. We determined whether recent fragmentation of Atlantic forest is causing population subdivision in a widespread and important Neotropical seed disperser: Artibeus lituratus (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). Genetic structure within highly fragmented forest in Paraguay was compared to that in mostly contiguous forest in neighbouring Misiones, Argentina. Further, observed genetic structure across the fragmented landscape was compared with expected levels of structure for similar time spans in realistic simulated landscapes under different degrees of reduction in gene ﬂow. If fragmentation signiﬁcantly reduced successful dispersal, greater population differentiation and stronger isolation by distance would be expected in the fragmented than in the continuous landscape, and genetic structure in the fragmented landscape should be similar to structure for simulated landscapes where dispersal had been substantially reduced. Instead, little genetic differentiation was observed, and no signiﬁcant correlation was found between genetic and geographic distance in fragmented or continuous landscapes. Furthermore, comparison of empirical and simulated landscapes indicated empirical results were consistent with regular long-distance dispersal and high migration rates. Our results suggest maintenance of high gene ﬂow for this relatively mobile and generalist species, which could be preventing or signiﬁcantly delaying reduction in population connectivity in fragmented habitat. Our conclusions apply to A. lituratus in Interior Atlantic Forest, and do not contradict broad evidence that habitat fragmentation is contributing to extinction of populations and species, and poses a threat to biodiversity worldwide.",

            "abstractNote": "Automated monitoring technologies can increase the efﬁciency of ecological data collection and support data-driven conservation. Camera traps coupled with infrared light barriers can be used to monitor temperate-zone bat assemblages at underground hibernacula, where thousands of individuals of multiple species can aggregate in winter. However, the broad-scale adoption of such photo-monitoring techniques is limited by the time-consuming bottleneck of manual image processing. Here, we present BatNet, an open-source, deep learning-based tool for automated identiﬁcation of 13 European bat species from camera trap images. BatNet includes a user-friendly graphical interface, where it can be retrained to identify new bat species or to create site-speciﬁc models to improve detection accuracy at new sites. Model accuracy was evaluated on images from both trained and untrained sites, and in an ecological context, where community- and species-level metrics (species diversity, relative abundance, and species-level activity patterns) were compared between human experts and BatNet. At trained sites, model performance was high across all species (F1-score: 0.98–1). At untrained sites, overall classiﬁcation accuracy remained high (96.7–98.2%), when camera placement was comparable to the training images (<3 m from the entrance; <45° angle relative to the opening). For atypical camera placements (>3 m or >45° angle), retraining the detector model with 500 site-speciﬁc annotations achieved an accuracy of over 95% at all sites. In the ecological case study, all investigated metrics were nearly identical between human experts and BatNet. Finally, we exemplify the ability to retrain BatNet to identify a new bat species, achieving an F1-score of 0.99 while maintaining high classiﬁcation accuracy for all original species. BatNet can be implemented directly to scale up the deployment of camera traps in Europe and enhance bat population monitoring. Moreover, the pretrained model can serve as a baseline for transfer learning to automatize the image-based identiﬁcation of bat species worldwide.",

Recent studies also demonstrate the value of both rangewide sampling and species distribution modelling (SDM) in comparative phylogeography. Here, we combine these approaches to study the population histories of four phylogenetically related forest-dependent bat species. All are endemic to the mountainous island of Taiwan but show differences in their tolerance to altitude, with Murina gracilis considered to be a high-altitude specialist, M. recondita and Kerivoula sp. low-altitude specialists, and M. puta an altitudinal generalist. We tested the prediction that contrasting habitat preferences would impact on patterns of past and contemporary gene ﬂow and found broad concordance between the results of population genetic analyses and species distribution models based on the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate. Both lowland species showed evidence of genetic divergence between the east and west of the island, consistent with SDMs that indicated the Central Mountain Range (CMR) has presented a long-term and continuous barrier to gene ﬂow since before the Last Glacial Maximum. In contrast, Murina gracilis and M. puta showed lower degrees of historical isolation and genetic differentiation associated with the CMR, reﬂecting greater gene ﬂow, possibly coupled with past population growth in M. puta. Together our results highlight the usefulness of combining distribution models with phylogeographic analyses to understand the drivers of genetic structure.",

The two bat species Murina gracilis and Murina recondita are both endemic to Taiwan and are putative sister species. To test for nonallopatric divergence and gene ﬂow in these taxa, we generated sequences using Sanger and next-generation sequencing, and combined these with microsatellite data for coalescent-based analyses. MtDNA phylogenies supported the reciprocally monophyletic sister relationship between M. gracilis and M. recondita; however, clustering of microsatellite genotypes revealed several cases of species admixture suggesting possible introgression. Sequencing of microsatellite ﬂanking regions revealed that admixture signatures stemmed from microsatellite allele homoplasy rather than recent introgressive hybridization, and also uncovered an unexpected sister relationship between M. recondita and the continental species Murina eleryi, to the exclusion of M. gracilis. To dissect the basis of these conﬂicts between ncDNA and mtDNA, we analysed sequences from 10 anonymous ncDNA loci with *BEAST and isolation-withmigration and found two distinct clades of M. eleryi, one of which was sister to M. recondita. We conclude that Taiwan was colonized by the ancestor of M. gracilis ﬁrst, followed by the ancestor of M. recondita after a period of allopatric divergence. After colonization, the mitochondrial genome of M. recondita was replaced by that of the resident M. gracilis. This study illustrates how apparent signatures of sympatric divergence can arise from complex histories of allopatric divergence, colonization and hybridization, thus highlighting the need for rigorous analyses to distinguish between such scenarios.",

            "abstractNote": "Researchers and practitioners from a range of ﬁelds including conservation biology, sociology, public health and economics rely on information gained from interviews to quantify the frequency and scale of activities or events of interest. These ‘recall’ data often form the basis of wildlife sustainability assessments and, ultimately, policy decisions and management actions, but they are highly vulnerable to bias, particularly when the behavior of interest has strong temporal variation. Here, we investigate bias in recalls of wildlife consumption in rural Madagascar by comparing oral recalls collected monthly and annually from male heads of household with daily diet diaries maintained by female heads of household. Daily diet calendars collected from 28 households were assumed to be the measure of true consumption and were used to validate the recalled information. While we found little interhousehold variation in accuracy of responses, we found a tendency for recalls to overreport rates of wildlife consumption. Estimating the annual frequency of rare and/or seasonal events was quantiﬁed more accurately by recalls of the prior year than by extrapolation of recalls of the prior month. We conclude that monthly variation in consumption rate leads to predictable errors in estimation of the annual consumption rate. Local consumption of wildlife has large temporal variability, reﬂecting human preference or the underlying life cycles of animals being consumed. Accurate assessment of consumption rates therefore requires determining an appropriate recall period by taking into account the temporal variability and frequency of the events in question.",

At least two analytical approaches to solving this problem have been utilized: (1) simultaneous analysis of molecular sequence and morphological data with fossil taxa included as terminals in the analysis, and (2) the molecular scaffold approach, in which morphological data are analyzed over a molecular backbone (with constraints that force extant taxa into positions suggested by sequence data). The perceived obstacles to including fossil taxa directly in simultaneous analyses of morphological and molecular sequence data with extant taxa include: (1) that fossil taxa are missing the molecular sequence portion of the character data; (2) that morphological characters might be misleading due to convergence; and (3) character weighting, specifically how and whether to weight characters in the morphological partition relative to characters in the molecular sequence data partition. The molecular scaffold has been put forward as a potential solution to at least some of these problems. Using examples of simultaneous analyses from the literature, as well as new analyses of previously published morphological and molecular sequence data matrices for extant and fossil Chiroptera (bats), we argue that the simultaneous analysis approach is superior to the molecular scaffold approach, specifically addressing the problems to which the molecular scaffold has been suggested as a solution. Finally, the application of phylogenetic hypotheses including fossil taxa (whatever their derivation) to the study of morphological character evolution is discussed, with special emphasis on scenarios in which fossil taxa are likely to be most enlightening: (1) in determining the sequence of character evolution; (2) in determining the timing of character evolution; and (3) in making inferences about the presence or absence of characteristics in fossil taxa that may not be directly observable in the fossil record.",

            "abstractNote": "Olive (Olea europaea L.) farming is one of the most widespread agricultural practice throughout the Mediterranean basin. Current trends even predict an increase in land area devoted to olive farms as well as the intensiﬁcation of farming practices. However, knowledge of the effects of olive farming on animal species still remains elusive and conservation and management guidelines for the relevant stakeholders are therefore urgently needed. Here, we investigate community composition and activity patterns of insectivorous bats in Mediterranean olive monocultures in Southern Portugal. Bats surveys were carried out in three types of olive farms representing increasing levels of management intensity: (1) traditional olive farms, managed with few or no chemical inputs or manual labor; (2) semiintensive olive farms, which share certain characteristics with traditional plantations, but are more intensively managed; (3) intensive olive farms, which are managed with high and frequent chemical inputs, and highly mechanized systems. We found differences in species richness and activity levels between farming practices. Both the number of species and foraging activity declined with increasing management intensity. However, olive groves as a whole showed a lower number of species compared with the regional species pool and extremely low activity levels, suggesting that large and homogeneous olive monocultures may serve more as commuting areas than true foraging habitats for bats. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study explicitly demonstrating the pervasive impact of olive farming on the community composition and activity levels of insectivorous bats. In the face of an even-increasing proportion of land surface devoted to olive farming in Mediterranean landscapes, our ﬁndings are therefore of great concern. We suggest that increasing habitat heterogeneity would contribute to preserve the community composition and ecological functionality of insectivorous bats in extensive olive monocultures.",

We hypothesised that the most important determining variables would not vary between different forest habitats and that social constraints may play a role in limiting commuting distances between roosting and foraging sites. Altogether 11 post-lactating adult females were radio-tracked in two predominantly oak forest habitats, where both potential roost and tree stand characteristics differed. We recorded 18 roosts; the distances between occupied roosts and commuting distances to foraging areas were measured. Within a 0.1 ha wide plot centred on each roost, a total of 17 habitat variables were recorded. Regardless of the different habitat structure (canopy closure, stand density) and roost-site availability, tracked females selected tree hollows with similar dimensions. The size of both roosting and foraging areas did not differ between habitats. We suggest that protection from predators and social constraints may determine the spatial distribution of Bechstein‟s bat roosts.",

UAVs are excellent candidates to greatly increase the environments in which such arrays can be deployed, but the impact of UAV noise on recording quality and the UAV's behavioral impact on the bats may affect usability. We developed a UAV-­borne multimicrophone setup capable of recording bat echolocation across diverse environments. We quantify and mitigate the impact of UAV noise on the recording setup and test the recording capability of the array by recording four common Danish bat species: Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Myotis daubentonii, Eptesicus serotinus, and Nyctalus noctula. The UAV produces substantial noise at ultrasonic frequencies relevant to many bat species. However, suspending the array 30 m below the UAV attenuates the noise to levels below the self-­noise of our recording system at 20 kHz and above, and we successfully record and acoustically localize all four bat species. The behavioral impact of the UAV is minimal as all four species approached the array to within 1 m and all emitted recordable feeding buzzes. UAV-­ borne multimicrophone arrays will allow us to quantify bat echolocation in hitherto unexplored habitats and provide crucial insight into how bats operate their sonar across their entire natural habitat.",

            "abstractNote": "Aim Every spring endangered Mexican long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris nivalis) migrate up to 1200 km from central Mexico to southern United States. Evidence suggests that L. nivalis follows the blooms of paniculate agave plants (genus Agave, subgenus Agave). Paniculate agave inﬂorescences are adapted to attract bats, and studies have indicated that Leptonycteris spp. played a key role in Agave speciation. We test the hypothesis of the Agave migratory corridor by (1) modelling the distribution of the relevant Agave species; and (2) testing whether bat records are signiﬁcantly related to Agave species richness as predicted by our models.",

            "abstractNote": "Measures of traits are the basis of functional biological diversity. Numerous works consider mean species-level measures of traits while ignoring individual variance within species. However, there is a large amount of variation within species and it is increasingly apparent that it is important to consider trait variation not only between species, but also within species. Mammals are an interesting group for investigating trait-based approaches because they play diverse and important ecological functions (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal, predation, grazing) that are correlated with functional traits. Here we compile a data set comprising morphological and life history information of 279 mammal species from 39,850 individuals of 388 populations ranging from À5.83 to À29.75 decimal degrees of latitude and À34.82 to À56.73 decimal degrees of longitude in the Atlantic forest of South America. We present trait information from 16,840 individuals of 181 species of non-volant mammals (Rodentia, Didelphimorphia, Carnivora, Primates, Cingulata, Artiodactyla, Pilosa, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla) and from 23,010 individuals of 98 species of volant mammals (Chiroptera). The traits reported include body mass, age, sex, reproductive stage, as well as the geographic coordinates of sampling for all taxa. Moreover, we gathered information on forearm length for bats and body length and tail length for rodents and marsupials. No copyright restrictions are associated with the use of this data set. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data.",

            "abstractNote": "Motion-triggered light-emitting diodes (LED) could reduce light pollution; however, its effect on nocturnal animals is poorly known. Here, we investigated how bats respond to the motion-triggered lighting of a bicycle path, an infrastructure that is increasingly being built to support human mobility. We measured the acoustic activity of bats in relation to the activity of LED lights. The responses of bats varied during the night and between functional guilds: Edge-space foraging bats avoided LED lighting, but the response was less clear during early and late night. Open-space foraging and narrow-space foraging bats avoided the LED lighting, especially late at night. The foraging intensity remained relatively stable across the night for bats of all guilds. We conclude that the motion-sensitive LED lighting of bicycle paths induces a guild-specific avoidance response in bats, which could be mitigated by shorter lighting periods.",

High-intensity echolocating species that used shorter, broadband signals and had shorter, broader wings (Pteronotus macleayii, Pteronotus quadridens, Mormoops blainvillii) foraged most in edge habitats, but differed in timing of peak activity. P. macleayii and M. blainvillii differed in diet, but low sample size precluded diet analysis for P. quadridens. High-intensity echolocating species that used longer, more narrowband signals and had longer, narrower wings (Molossus molossus, Tadarida brasiliensis) foraged most in open areas and differed in diet from the other species. Two disparate species were most active in clutter (dense vegetation). Pteronotus parnellii used high-duty-cycle echolocation apparently specialized for detecting ﬂuttering targets in clutter. Macrotus waterhousii used low-intensity, broadband echolocation calls and presumably uses prey-generated sounds when foraging. These two species also differed in diet. Our data show that differences in morphology and echolocation behaviour coincide with differences in habitat use and diet, resulting in minimal overlap in resource use among species.",

            "abstractNote": "Billions of birds migrate at night over North America each year. However, few studies have described the phenology of these movements, such as magnitudes, directions, and speeds, for more than one migration season and at regional scales. In this study, we characterize density, direction, and speed of nocturnally migrating birds using data from 13 weather surveillance radars in the autumns of 2010 and 2011 in the northeastern USA. After screening radar data to remove precipitation, we applied a recently developed algorithm for characterizing velocity profiles with previously developed methods to document bird migration. Many hourly radar scans contained windborne “contamination,” and these scans also exhibited generally low overall reflectivities. Hourly scans dominated by birds showed nightly and seasonal patterns that differed markedly from those of low reflectivity scans. Bird migration occurred during many nights, but a smaller number of nights with large movements of birds defined regional nocturnal migration. Densities varied by date, time, and location but peaked in the second and third deciles of night during the autumn period when the most birds were migrating. Migration track (the direction to which birds moved) shifted within nights from south-­southwesterly to southwesterly during the seasonal migration peaks; this shift was not consistent with a similar shift in wind direction. Migration speeds varied within nights, although not closely with wind speed. Airspeeds increased during the night; groundspeeds were highest between the second and third deciles of night, when the greatest density of birds was migrating. Airspeeds and groundspeeds increased during the fall season, although groundspeeds fluctuated considerably with prevailing winds. Significant positive correlations characterized relationships among bird densities at southern coastal radar stations and northern inland radar stations. The quantitative descriptions of broadscale nocturnal migration patterns presented here will be essential for biological and conservation applications. These descriptions help to define migration phenology in time and space, fill knowledge gaps in avian annual cycles, and are useful for monitoring long-t­erm population trends of migrants. Furthermore, these descriptions will aid in assessing potential risks to migrants, particularly from structures with which birds collide and artificial lighting that disorients migrants.",

By molecular investigations, using a generic real-time RTPCR (RT-qPCR) that detects all previously known inﬂuenza A virus subtypes (H1-H16) and a newly developed RT-qPCR speciﬁc for the South American bat inﬂuenza-like virus of subtype H17, a total of 1571 samples obtained from 1369 individual bats of 26 species from Central Europe were examined. No evidence for the occurrence of such inﬂuenza viruses was found. Further attempts towards a more comprehensive evaluation of the role of bats in the ecology and epidemiology of inﬂuenza viruses should be based on more intense monitoring efforts. However, given the protected status of bats, not only in Europe, such activities need to be embedded into existing pathogen-monitoring programs.",

Nevertheless, most data papers have focused on species occurrence or abundance, whereas interactions have received much less attention. To help fill this gap, we have compiled a georeferenced data set of interactions between 93 bat species of the family Phyllostomidae (Chiroptera) and 501 plant species of 68 families. Data came from 169 studies published between 1957 and 2007 covering the entire Neotropical Region, with most records from Brazil (34.5% of all study sites), Costa Rica (16%), and Mexico (14%). Our data set includes 2571 records of frugivory (75.1% of all records) and nectarivory (24.9%). The best represented bat genera are Artibeus (28% of all records), Carollia (24%), Sturnira (10.1%), and Glossophaga (8.8%). Carollia perspicillata (187), Artibeus lituratus (125), Artibeus jamaicensis (94), Glossophaga soricina (86), and Artibeus planirostris (74) were the bat species with the broadest diets recorded based on the number of plant species. Among the plants, the best represented families were Moraceae (17%), Piperaceae (15.4%), Urticaceae (9.2%), and Solanaceae (9%).",

Here, we introduce tree\n                    NODF\n                    , a new class of nestedness that takes into account the resemblance of descriptor variables.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The method is an extension of the\n                    NODF\n                    index and can be applied to systems in which the resemblance of descriptor variables is described by a tree‐like object. Computation of tree\n                    NODF\n                    is similar to\n                    NODF\n                    , but uses branch lengths instead of the sum of species occurrences. In this way, we can calculate a phylo\n                    NODF\n                    for metacommunities if a phylogeny is used to account for differences in phylogenetic diversity (\n                    PD\n                    ) and trait\n                    NODF\n                    if a functional dendrogram constructed from species ecological traits is used to account for the functional diversity (\n                    FD\n                    ) of communities. Similar to\n                    NODF\n                    , tree\n                    NODF\n                    can also be used to assess nestedness among species. In this case, env\n                    NODF\n                    uses a dendrogram describing the resemblance among the environmental conditions of different sites, to test whether rare species occur in a subset of the environmental conditions in the habitats occupied by frequent species.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    tree\n                    NODF\n                    is a composite metric that can be additively partitioned into compositional (S.fraction) and tree‐topology (topo\n                    NODF\n                     = tree\n                    NODF\n                    – S.fraction) components of the descriptor variables. Tests of tree\n                    NODF\n                    and its components can be carried out using null models and, if a hypothetical factor is used to order metacommunity data, permutation tests. We show that tree\n                    NODF\n                    is robust for matrix size and fill, as well as for tree topology.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Finally, we illustrate the use of tree\n                    NODF\n                    by analysing data on Caribbean bats using phylo\n                    NODF\n                    , trait\n                    NODF\n                    and env\n                    NODF\n                    , as well as their composition and tree‐topology components.",

            "abstractNote": "Variation in survival over time and among age and sex classes drives population dynamics for a large majority of long-lived species and is critical to understanding species demography. For highly mobile species that actively move among potential breeding locations, coupling survival information with estimates of locational ﬁdelity provides the basis for our understanding of species population dynamics. We studied the effect of time, age and sex class and climatic variables on survival and roost transition probabilities on a population of Egyptian slit-faced bats in Swaziland from 1450 marked individuals from 16 roosts over a 10-year period. We then used variance components analysis to estimate average annual survival and associated temporal process variance. Annual apparent survival varied with sex and age, being highest in adult males and lowest in juvenile females. We did not ﬁnd evidence of survival being inﬂuenced by climatological factors as commonly observed in temperate bats. Roost switching occurred frequently, with more transitions to roosts harboring larger number of bats. Furthermore, the probability of transitioning to another roost was related to its distance from the original roost. The dispersal patterns revealed in this study were consistent with the ﬁssion–fusion dynamics common for colonial bats.",

Bats are also important vectors of infectious diseases, harboring more than 100 different virus types. In the present study, we compiled information on bat communities from the Atlantic Forests of South America, a species-rich biome that is highly threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. The ATLANTIC BATS data set comprises 135 quantitative studies carried out in 205 sites, which cover most vegetation types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest: dense ombrophilous forest, mixed ombrophilous forest, semideciduous forest, deciduous forest, savanna, steppe, and open ombrophilous forest. The data set includes information on more than 90,000 captures of 98 bat species of eight families. Species richness averaged 12.1 per site, with a median value of 10 species (ranging from 1 to 53 species). Six species occurred in more than 50% of the communities: Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, Artibeus fimbriatus, Glossophaga soricina, and Platyrrhinus lineatus. The number of captures divided by sampling effort, a proxy for abundance, varied from 0.000001 to 0.77 individualsÁhÀ1ÁmÀ2 (0.04 Æ 0.007 individualsÁhÀ1ÁmÀ2). Our data set reveals a hyper-dominance of eight species that together that comprise 80% of all captures: Platyrrhinus lineatus (2.3%), Molossus molossus (2.8%), Artibeus obscurus (3.4%), Artibeus planirostris (5.2%), Artibeus fimbriatus (7%), Sturnira lilium (14.5%), Carollia perspicillata (15.6%), and Artibeus lituratus (29.2%).",

DNA sequences from three segments of the mitochondrial genome were collected from four species of Emballonura and from M. nigrescens to investigate the relationship of genetic differentiation to archipelago biogeography. Specimens of each species formed monophyletic clades in maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Mosia nigrescens was genetically distant to the other four species. The other four studied species formed a monophyletic clade composed of the pairs E. beccarii, E. serii and E. raffrayana, E. semicaudata. Clades within species were strongly concordant with geography, with only two counterexamples (E. semicaudata in Fiji and E. raffrayana in the Solomon Islands) to the general ﬁnding that each island’s population of a species constitutes a monophyletic clade. Genetic results do not agree with current subspeciﬁc designations within M. nigrescens. Samples from Woodlark, Alcester, and Manus Islands are phylogenetically closer to Papuan mainland samples than to Solomon Islands and New Ireland samples supposedly belonging to the same subspecies. Results suggest that Emballonura can establish populations across wide water barriers but does so infrequently. The isolating effect of water barriers is exempliﬁed by the substantial genetic distinctiveness of Solomon Islands and New Ireland populations of both E. raffrayana and M. nigrescens. Absence from New Britain of E. beccarii, E. raffrayana, and E. serii (all known from New Ireland) may also reﬂect effects of water barriers if not due to collecting artifacts.",

We evaluated the impact of eucalypt plantations on native bats in a Mediterranean area, taking Portugal as a case study. We compared the overall bat activity, species richness and Kuhl’s bat Pipistrellus kuhlii (the most abundant bat species in the area) activity between eucalypt plantations and native montado habitat, and examined the inﬂuence of stand, landscape and survey variables within plantations on the response variables. A set of 11 plantation stands, three landscape and two survey variables were employed as predictor variables using a zero-inﬂated Poisson generalized linear mixed model. Hawking and generalist bats of the genus Pipistrellus were the most frequently detected species. Bat activity, species richness and P. kuhlii activity were higher in native montado than in any of the eucalypt stands. Mature eucalypt plantations showed the highest bat activity, while clear-cut areas showed the lowest. Generally, within eucalypt stands, complex high-level vegetation structure, from the ground level up to 3 m high, and proximity to water points were associated with higher levels of bat and P. kuhlii activity and species richness. The results suggest that in order to promote bat diversity and activity in exotic eucalypt plantations in the Mediterranean region, it is important to provide a high density of water points, maintain plots of mature plantations and promote understorey clutter.",

Croton piptocalF, Bauhinia f.$cata subsp. pruinosa, Senna macranthera, Schizolobium parahyba, Piptadenia gonoacantha, Chorisia speciosa, Pseudobombax grandijlorum, Firm guaranitica, Esenbeckia leioratpa, Pachystroma longifolium, Myroxylon peruifprum, and Hymenaea courbaril. Field trials were carried out at Santa Genebra Municipal Reserve, Campinas, SP, Brazil, at the forest edge and in the understory. No significant correlations were detected between successional status and seed size or seed water content. Light-regulated germination was present only in small-seeded species. In field experiments, most species, including the light-sensitive ones, were able to germinate under the canopy, where a low red/far-red ratio predominates. Most species, mainly those of early- and intermediate successional positions, presented low seedling survival rates under shade. Myroxylon peru;ferum was the most shade tolerant species, while S. granuloso-lqrosum, C speciosa, I? gonoacantha, E guaranitica, 7: micrantha, and S. parahyba were the most shade intolerant. These latter species showed little or no survival under the shade conditions.",

Its populations are reported to be declining in much of the species’ geographical range, which is quite fragmented. In Italy R. mehelyi was thought to be extinct in peninsular Italy, and still occurring in Sardinia (with large colonies) and Sicily (two remnant colonies). For peninsular Italy its presence was reported only for Apulia (SE Italy) but the latest records dated back to the 1960’s. In this note we conﬁrm the presence of this species in the same region for the Zinzulusa Cave (Castro, Lecce).",

Yet, this process has too often been conducted at the cost of airborne biodiversity such as birds and bats. The latter are severely threatened due to deaths by collision at wind turbine. The UNEP/EUROBATS agreement that came into force in 1994 is now ratified by 37 countries; since 2008, it recommends to site wind turbines at least 200 m away from woody edges to decrease bat fatality risks. However, 14 years later we still do not know to what extent this international recommendation has been applied in Europe. We assessed siting distances between woody edges and wind turbines for the largest wind energy producers among the UNEP/EUROBATS parties: the UK, Germany, and France. We show that 61%, 78%, and 56%, respectively, of the installed wind turbines did not comply with UNEP/EUROBATS guidelines, without improvement over time. We identified probable causes of these findings and provided key policy recommendations to achieve compliance to UNEP/EUROBATS guidelines such as better: (i) inclusion in regulatory texts, (ii) notification of the environmental authorities, and (iii) strategic, well‐informed, forward planning of areas suitable for wind turbine development.",

Exemplified by the common vampire bat, we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments. Growing populations of common vampire bats impact human, livestock and wildlife health in Latin America through transmission of pathogens, such as lethal rabies viruses. Techniques to determine large-scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality- and species-specific projections of disease transmission risks. However, previously used methods are not cost-effective and efficient for large-scale applications. Using bloodmeal and faecal samples from common vampire bats from coastal, Andean and Amazonian regions of Peru, we showcase metabarcoding as a scalable tool to assess vampire bat population structure and feeding preferences. Dietary metabarcoding was highly effective, detecting vertebrate prey in 93.2% of the samples. Bats predominantly preyed on domestic animals, but fed on tapirs at one Amazonian site. In addition, we identified arthropods in 9.3% of samples, likely reflecting consumption of ectoparasites. Using the same data, we document mitochondrial geographic population structure in the common vampire bat in Peru. Such simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure can enable new insights into the interplay between vampire bat ecology and disease transmission risks. Importantly, the methodology can be incorporated into metabarcoding diet studies of other animals to couple information on diet and population structure.",

Long-tubed ﬂowers have specialized on one or several species of long-tongued euglossine bees, but longtongued bees have not specialized on long-tubed ﬂowers. Whereas long tongues may have evolved to provide access to a wider variety of nectar resources, long nectar spurs may be a mechanism for ﬂowers to conserve nectar resources while remaining attractive to traplining bee visitors.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding microhabitat requirements for species vulnerable to anthropogenic threats can provide important information to conservation managers. This may be particularly true for ectotherms, where behaviour and physiology (e.g. digestion, responsiveness and activity patterns) are strongly inﬂuenced by thermal conditions of microhabitat retreat sites. Retreat sites selected by south-west carpet pythons (Morelia spilota imbricata) were identiﬁed through radiotracking 46 pythons over 3 years. Tree hollows appear to be a very important resource for pythons: 61% (22 of 36 individuals tracked over winter) used tree hollows as retreat sites (56% of all observations in winter), and remained in hollows for an average of 124 Ϯ 49 (range 34 to 210) days. If pythons did not use tree hollows over winter, they found refuge in one of four alternative microhabitats: low vegetation cover (26% of winter observations), ground cover (10%), on tree branches (6%) or in hollow logs on the ground (2%). We tested whether tree hollows provide a thermally distinct environment compared with alternative microhabitats, but found no difference in minimum, average, maximum or range of temperatures recorded between microhabitats. When within tree hollows over winter, pythons had colder daily average and maximum body temperatures (cf. pythons that used other microhabitats), but this did not give them an energy saving (in terms of body condition scores). Pythons ate very little over winter and we predict that animals sequestered within tree hollows do not access prey at this time. Tree hollows provide a critical refuge over winter when python body temperature is low, and their responsiveness is limited, rendering individuals vulnerable to predation by terrestrial predators (e.g. introduced red fox). Destruction of hollows through ﬁre, land clearing, competition with other fauna species and the signiﬁcant age required for hollows to form in trees all contribute to the decline in availability of this important microhabitat.",

A 3‐cm charcoal layer was dated to 2720±30 cal. a\n              BP\n              and inferred to be Woodland Indian in origin from microscopic inspection and thickness.

European bats exemplify the need for successful and cost-effective management for both reasons, often simultaneously. Across Europe, bats are protected, and the concept of Favourable Conservation Status (FCS) is used as a key tool for the assessment and licensing of disruptive actions to populations. However, for efﬁcient decision-making, this assessment requires knowledge on the demographic rates and long-term dynamics of populations. We used capture–mark–recapture to describe demographic rates for the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) at two sites in England and investigate the transition rates between three stages: juveniles, immatures, and breeders. We then use these rates in an individual-based population dynamics model to investigate the expected trajectories for both populations. Our results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the presence and scale of temporal variation in this species’ demography. We describe the lengthy prereproductive period (3.5 years) that female Serotines experience. Finally, we show how site-speciﬁc variation in demographic rates can produce divergent population trajectories. Effective management of European bat populations can be achieved through the understanding of life histories, and local demographic rates and population dynamics, in order to anticipate the presence of source and sink sites in the landscape. Using the Serotine bat in England, we show that these can be obtained from rigorous and systematic studies of long-term demographic datasets.",

As the number of electronic herbarium records proliferates, the importance of linking these records to the physical specimens they represent as well as to related records from other sources will intensify. Although a rich and diverse literature has developed over the past decade that addresses the use of specimen identifiers for facilitating linking across the internet, few implementable guidelines or recommended practices for herbaria have been advanced. Here we review this literature with the express purpose of distilling a specific set of recommendations especially tailored to herbarium specimen digitization, curation, and management. We argue that associating globally unique identifiers (\n              GUID\n              s) with physical herbarium specimens and including these identifiers in all electronic records about those specimens is essential to effective digital data curation. We also address practical applications for ensuring these associations.",

These species have different sex chromosome systems. Through banding techniques, chromosomes homologies between Carollia perspicillata and Rhinophylla pumilio were not found, possibly because Carollia species have highly rearranged chromosomes. Probably, Rhinophylla is better associated to Phyllostomini tribe. Sex vesicle pairing behavior at the meiotic prophase was analyzed in both species. R. pumilio had a simple sex chromosome system (XX/XY), the XY pair showed an asynchronic behavior compared to the autosomal bivalents. The sex vesicle showes the X and Y pairing in the pseudoautosomal region. Moreover, a folding of the X-asynaptic axis on itself and condensed differentiated axes were also identified. In C. perspicillata, with a multiple sex chromosome system (XY1Y2), the segments Xp-Y1 and Xq-Y2 paired independently from each other. Compared to the autosomes, the sex vesicle showed a precocious pairing behavior. In C. perspicillata, a NOR stained with silver was localized in the X rearranged chromosome. Possibly, this region separates the XY1Y2 trivalent in two independent parts: one involving the X and Y2 autosomal with transcriptional activity, and the other corresponding to the original X and Y sex pair.",

Exclosures were also used to determine the relative importance of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators. Although species differed significantly in levels of predation, predation of seeds exposed to vertebrates was high (>75%) for all species, while seed predation by invertebrates was lower and more variable. Seed and seedling predation by insects was significantly higher in mature forest, while seed predation by rodents was higher in fallow areas. Other sources of mortality (primarily desiccation) were higher for seeds in fallow areas. The percentage of seeds moved was significantlydifferent among species but not between forests.",

We sampled a wide range of elevations and associated habitat types throughout Belize. Anabat provides an instantaneous output of echolocation call structure with a laptop computer. Select sequences can be saved directly to the hard drive, avoiding extraneous noise and sound distortion commonly associated with tape recorders. To date, 18 of the 37 species known or expected to occur in the study region were identified by recognizable differences in the time-frequency characteristics of echolocation calls. In general, each family is recognizable by call structure patterns and species readily separated by frequency range parameters. Species that commute or forage at high altitudes are not susceptible to capture but are conspicuous by acoustic sampling. Further work is needed to determine limitations of the equipment, establish better sampling procedures, and develop a comprehensive library of vocal signatures incorporating the range of variation inherent in each species. As this work progresses, we predict the addition of hitherto unknown species occurring within the study region.",

            "abstractNote": "Deltamethrin (DTM) is a synthetic pyrethroid widely used in the cultivation and management of several crops due to its insecticidal action. Application to crops of pyrethroids such as DTM can result in the of water and fruit consumed by fruit bats having a high pyrethroid content which may be harmful. Therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-t­erm oral exposure of the fruit-e­ ating bats (Artibeus lituratus) to two concentrations of DTM (0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg of papaya) on histopathology of the intestine, liver and kidney. The intestine of the animals exposed to both concentrations showed inflammatory infiltrate, degeneration, necrosis and goblet cell hyperplasia as the most frequent pathologies. Besides, the acid mucins showed an increase in the frequency of non-­ viable cells. The liver showed hepatocyte vacuolizatio and nuclear enlargement, as well as inflammatory infiltrate and steatosis. The kidneys of the exposed animals showed and inflammatory infiltrate, benign nephrosclerosis, vacuolization and necrosis. Also, DTM reduced nitric oxide synthesis, decreased glomerular diameter and increased glycogen percentage in the proximal tubules. Our results suggest that acute exposure to DTM at low concentrations has the potential to induce pronounced histopathological changes in vital organs, such as intestine, liver and kidney of fruit-­eating bats.",

We developed Animal Sound Identiﬁer (ASI), a MATLAB software that performs probabilistic classiﬁcation of species occurrences from ﬁeld recordings. Unlike most previous approaches, ASI locates training data directly from the ﬁeld recordings and thus avoids the need of pre-deﬁned reference libraries. We apply ASI to a case study on Amazonian birds, in which we classify the vocalisations of 14 species in 194 504 oneminute audio segments using in total two weeks of expert time to construct, parameterise, and validate the classiﬁcation models. We compare the classiﬁcation performance of ASI (with training templates extracted automatically from ﬁeld data) to that of monitoR (with training templates extracted manually from the Xeno-Canto database), the results showing ASI to have substantially higher recall and precision rates.",

Yet, this mechanism is not well understood in flying insectivorous animals. This is particularly true of bats, where many ecologically similar or cryptic species coexist. The detailed analysis of the foraging niche in sympatric, cryptic sibling species provides an excellent framework to disentangle the role of specific niche factors likely involved in facilitating coexistence. We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the prey species consumed by a population of sympatric sibling Rhinolophus euryale and Rhinolophus mehelyi whose use of habitat in both sympatric and allopatric ranges has been well established through radio tracking. Although some subtle dietary differences exist in prey species composition, the diet of both bats greatly overlapped (Ojk = 0.83) due to the consumption of the same common and widespread moths. Those dietary differences we did detect might be related to divergences in prey availabilities among foraging habitats, which prior radio tracking on the same population showed are differentially used and selected when both species co-occur. This minor dietary segregation in sympatry may be the result of foraging on the same prey-types and could contribute to reduce potential competitive interactions (e.g., for prey, acoustic space). Our results highlight the need to evaluate the spatial niche dimension in mediating the cooccurrence of similar insectivorous bat species, a niche factor likely involved in processes of bat species coexistence.",

            "abstractNote": "Lower Central America (LCA) provides a geologically complex and dynamic, richly biodiverse model for studying the recent assembly and diversiﬁcation of a Neotropical biota. Here, we review the growing literature of LCA phylogeography studies and their contribution to understanding the origins, assembly, and diversiﬁcation of the LCA biota against the backdrop of regional geologic and climatic history, and previous biogeographical inquiry. Studies to date reveal that phylogeographical signal within taxa of differing distributions reﬂects a diversity of patterns and processes rivalling the complexities of LCA landscapes themselves. Even so, phylogeography is providing novel insights into regional diversiﬁcation (e.g. cryptic lineage divergences), and general evolutionary patterns are emerging. Congruent multi-taxon phylogeographic breaks are found across the Nicaraguan depression, Chorotega volcanic front, western and central Panama, and the Darie´n isthmus, indicating that a potentially shared history of responses to regional-scale (e.g. geological) processes has shaped the genetic diversity of LCA communities. By contrast, other species show unique demographic histories in response to overriding historical events, including no phylogeographic structure at all. These low-structure or incongruent patterns provide some evidence for a role of local, ecological factors (e.g. long-distance dispersal and gene ﬂow in plants and bats) in shaping LCA communities. Temporally, comparative phylogeographical structuring reﬂects Pliocene–Pleistocene dispersal and vicariance events consistent with the timeline of emergence of the LCA isthmus and its major physiographic features, e.g. cordilleras. We emphasise the need to improve biogeographic inferences in LCA through in-depth comparative phylogeography projects capitalising on the latest statistical phylogeographical methods. While meeting the challenges of reconstructing the biogeographical history of this complex region, phylogeographers should also take up the critical service to society of applying their work to the conservation of its fascinating biodiversity.",

Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal‐Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinatorl disperser classes. Mann‐Whitney\n              U\n              ‐tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose‐rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran fruits were sucrose‐rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plant‐animal interactions be anticipated.",

In order to learn about the current native mammals from the state, available literature of mammal records in the state was reviewed, finding that most studies have been carried out in the last 60 years. Ten orders, 29 families (72.5% national wide), 105 genera (58.01%), and 154 species (28.79%), including 50 monotypic and 104 politypic; 35 species are endemics to the country and three to the state. The most diverse orders are Chiroptera (66 species), Rodentia (36), Carnivora (20), and Cetacea (17); 31 taxa were described based on specimens collected in the state. In regard to the species distributional affinities, most terrestrial are Mesoamerican (70), then Neotropical (36) and Nearctic (31), while for the Order Cetacea there are 13 Tropical and four Antitropical. There are at least 40 species recorded on national or international conservation lists. Only one species has reduced its distribution or has been extirpated from the state and, two species of pinnipeds have been registered only once, in this paper we have considered them as outliers.",

To increase the information about bat communities in Cuevas de Talgua, we did an inventory in the zone. We used capture technique with mist nets. Furthermore, we recorded with a SongMeter2. We identify eight species of bat. Carollia perspicillata was the species with more capture frequency. The sound record allows us to identify to Pteronotus mesoamericanus. Many of the species found in the area are of vital importance to the functioning of the dry forest. They fulfill the roles of seed dispersers and pest controllers.",

An interesting evolutionary and colonization history has accommodated a current diversity of 51 species of wild mammals on the island representing 26% of the country’s continental mammals, including two introduced species with wild populations. The 78.4% are micromammals (bats and rodents) just as there is no evidence of large predators or species with large habitat requirements. It was also formalized the presence of six species on the island. These are: Lampronycteris brachyotis, Lonchorhina aurita, Micronycteris microtis, Trinycteris nicefori, Chrotopterus auritus and Natalus mexicanus, which, although included in technical reports, were not supported by any scientific publication.

All publications were made by foreigners until the end of the last century. In the last two decades, however, there has been an important contribution from national researchers. The period can be divided into four seccions, which boom has depended on the socio-political situations of the country. The first period covered the 19th century. The second and third the first and second half of the 20th century, respectively. Finally the fourth covered throughout this century. In the work we highlight the most important contributions to the study of the bats of Nicaragua from national and foreign naturalists and scientists. In this sense, this work is the first compilation of the historical contributions of the study of bats in the country.",

Initially, 26 species of microbats were reported, and no comprehensive study has been undertaken since 1991. The advent of genetic molecular studies has revealed some species to be the same (Pipistrellus deserti and Pipistrellus kuhlii) while others have had their nomenclature changed (Eptisecus isabellinus instead of Eptisecus serotinus, Plecotus gaisleri instead of Plecotus austriacus, Rhinopoma cystops instead of Rhinopoma hardwickei). Miniopterus schreibersii is now classified in the new family of Miniopteridae. These changes have corrected the number of Algerian bat species to 25, belonging to seven different families. All species are threatened globally and are protected at the national level by Decree 12-135.",

Negative interactions, commonly termed human-wildlife conflict (HWC), have increased in recent decades due to a number of factors including difficulties in identifying and communicating the complexities of stakeholder values and positions over wildlife and its management. Here, we present the perceptions of two conservation organizations on the landscape of HWC involving the threatened Mauritius Fruit Bat Pteropus niger, Kerr 1792 in Mauritius, including damage to fruit crops and controversial government culls in 2015 and 2016. Participants identified 18 stakeholders in the conflict varying in importance and influence, examined where and how hostility is manifested, and delineated both perceived and real costs of the conflict. Additionally, 13 environmental and 17 social risk factors associated with the conflict were categorized, along with potential policy and management options for mitigation. We argue that initial in-house workshops are advantageous in understanding conservation conflicts before extending dialogue with other stakeholders.",

There are 147 endemic species and the rest are a combination of species of Nearctic and Neotropical affinities in similar proportions. The conservation status of species indicates that there are severe environmental problems, because eight species have disappeared in the last century, and 202 are classified in one of the categories of conservation concern. Finally, there are three introduced species that have become established in the country.",

Available literature was reviewed in regard to both, the terrestrial and the marine mammals, known from state of Nayarit, Mexico. Thirteen orders, 30 families, 88 genera, and 143 species are currently known for the state, with 32 endemic species for the country and 6 at state level. Most diverse orders are Chiroptera (61 species), Rodentia (33), Cetacea (20), and Carnivora (17); with 31 taxa described based on specimens collected at the state. It is noteworthy that bat species almost duplicate the number of rodent species, while both at international and national level, rodents are the most abundant. Regarding the species distribution, most of them have Mesoamerican affinities (53), rather than Nearctic (41) or Neotropical (29). Forty-one species are listed within either national or international conservation lists, including the 21 marine species.",

As for most model-ﬁtting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both ﬁxed- and random-eﬀects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the proﬁled deviance or the proﬁled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the proﬁled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Suﬃcient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to ﬁt specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.",

            "abstractNote": "Species in Carollia, although loosely recognizable by size and shape, show overlap in most morphological character states as well as in geographic distribution and use of resources. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding where and what this overlap is. Variation in the morphology of Carollia should correspond to the environment, yet such patterns remain unknown. Species may coexist as a function of environmental factors and sympatry may not be uniform along the distributional extent of these species. An informed perception of the morphological and ecological variation across their geographic range may clarify not only the limits and extents of their spatial and morphological boundaries, but also may provide insights into the relationships among size, shape and environment. In our quantitative analysis of the variation in morphology and environment we tried to answer what limits species distribution, as well as how morphology changes with the environment within and among species. A combination of multivariate contrasts and partial least square analyses were used to assess the correlations and interactions between size, shape, distribution and environment among C. castanea (small), C. brevicauda (medium) and C. perspicillata (large size) in Ecuador. We show how the three Carollia species vary and differentiate along an ecomorphological space of gradients, barriers, size and shape. From a macroecological perspective, and contrary to the theory of limiting similarity, the smallest species is the most distinct in its environmental space and also the one that experiences the strongest changes in shape across geographic regions. The other two more similar species, in both size and shape, show a larger overlap in their environmental space. This seems to suggest that size can act as a buffer in extreme or changing environments and that higher gene flow is more probable for larger high-altitude species.",

            "abstractNote": "The sensory drive hypothesis of speciation predicts that divergence in communication systems will occur when environments differ and that this sensory divergence can ultimately promote speciation. The factors affecting geographic evolution in acoustic signals remain poorly understood, especially in the contexts of high gene ﬂow. This study investigated variation patterns in peak frequency emitted by the Chinese endemic Myotis davidii on a broad geographic scale by evaluating the relative importance of morphological, environmental, geographic, and genetic variables. Signiﬁcant variation in peak frequency was observed among regions, but peak frequencies among populations within region had some percentage of similarity. Differences in peak frequency were not associated with morphological difference, genetic structure, and geographic distance among regions, which suggested that peak frequency divergences in M. davidii were not the primary driver of regions’ isolation in a context of weak gene ﬂow. Within the Middle East Plain (MEP), one of the regions delineated in this study, peak frequency differences of M. davidii were not signiﬁcantly correlated with genetic distance and geographic distance among populations, suggesting that peak frequency was not be subject to cultural drift within MEP. Our results provide evidence that geographic variation in echolocation call design may evolve as a consequence of local adaptation to climate conditions.",

The description is based on specimens removed from the small intestine of ghost-faced bats, Mormoops megalophylla, from central Mexico. The monotypic genus is unique in featuring sexual dimorphism on the cuticular ornamentation, which consists of the presence of spines on the anterior quarter of females, and of the presence of rugosities on the surface of the cephalic vesicle of males. The cuticular spines are arranged in spiral rings on the anterior quarter of the body, and there is no trace of said structures on the cuticle of males. The synlophe of the males possess 12 ridges, whereas there is no synlophe in females. Finally, females show a prominent caudal terminus (spine) and 3 subterminal tubercles, whereas males show bursal rays in a 3–2 arrangement, with a relatively prominent dorsal ray.",

The P. hastatus specimens presented 2n=32 chromosomes, including 13 biarmed autosome pairs and one acrocentric. The X chromosome is submetacentric and the Y is a minute acrocentric. A. lituratus has 2n=30 chromosomes in females and 31 in males specimens. The autosomes are 14 biarmed pairs and the chromosomal sexual system is XY1Y2 type, being the X chromosome a large submetacentric and both Y1 (real Y) and Y2 acrocentric elements. Several chromosomal homologies are shared between both taxa, including whole chromosomes and chromosomal arms. Based on similarity of G-banding pattern is proposed that the system XY1Y2 from A. lituratus risen by a tandem fusion event involving the stenodermatine original biarmed X chromosome with the autosome acrocentric homologous to Y2.",

The proportion of infested female M. nattereri (54 %) is higher than that of infested males (17 %), which can be explained by the more gregarious behaviour of females. These proportions are almost similar during the bat’s mating season only (in autumn). The sex-ratio of the collected B. nattereri is balanced but female (resp. male) bat flies are more numerous on female (resp. male) bats. The existence of a physiological specificity is surmised to explain this unequal distribution. The low number of bat flies on each M. nattereri (1.7 B. nattereri per parasited host on average, 8 at the maximum) seems due to the relatively large size of the parasite.",

A high diversity of haemosporidian parasites has been described from bats, but our understanding of their prevalence, distribution and use of hosts remain fragmented. The haemosporidian parasites of bats in Cameroon have been largely understudied, but here, bats, sampled from different habitat types of the Central Region of Cameroon, were investigated for haemosporidian infections with a combination of microscopic and molecular phylogenetic analysis. An overall prevalence of 18.1% of haemosporidian infections was detected in a total of 155 investigated bats belonging to 14 bat species. For the first time Hepatocystis and Nycteria parasites were detected in bats from Cameroon and molecularly characterized. Hepatocystis infections were exclusively identified in the epauletted fruit bat host species Epomophorus pusillus with a high prevalence of 65.5%, whereas Nycteria infections could be detected in several hosts, namely: Doryrhina cyclops (60.0%), Rhinolophus landeri (20.0%) and one Nycteris grandis. This study unveils evidence that habitat types may play a role in transmission of Hepatocystis parasites on a local scale and it adds important information on the distribution and host specificity of the neglected haemosporidian genus Nycteria.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat species in the genus Pteropus (flying foxes) occur throughout most of Southeast Asia, but little is known about their distribution and patterns of local diversity across much of Indonesia. To help address this problem, a field survey of Pteropus species in Central and West Seram, Maluku Province, Indonesia, was conducted in 2012 and 2013. This study resulted in new records of rare Moluccan bats, including new locality records for four nearendemic species: P. chrysoproctus, P. melanopogon, P. ocularis, and P. temminckii. Together with data from additional specimens, these records provide new information about morphological variation in Moluccan Pteropus. High local diversity of large-bodied bats with restricted geographic ranges raises interesting questions about evolution in Pteropus and about ecological niche partitioning in Paleotropical pteropodid communities. More monitoring efforts in Maluku are needed, as the roosts located during the 2012–2013 survey are some of the only known sites where these species may be found, and none of these sites are located in protected areas. Without updated natural history data and taxonomic revision, proper management decisions cannot be made for any of these threatened species despite mounting anthropogenic pressure on their populations.",

Our analyses support the existence of a further species of Aselliscus in northeastern Vietnam that separated from A. stoliczkanus sensu lato (s.l.) during the late Miocene. Within the latter taxon, we identified five geographic lineages that diverged from each other during the Plio-Pleistocene epoch. Some of them may also correspond to further separate taxa, but additional molecular and morphological data are needed to test this hypothesis. Herewith, based on the combined evidences we describe the northeastern Vietnamese population as a separate species.",

            "abstractNote": "Synopsis\n            Frugivores have evolved sensory and behavioral adaptations that allow them to find ripe fruit effectively, but the relative importance of different senses in varying foraging scenarios is still poorly understood. Within Neotropical ecosystems, short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia: Phyllostomidae) are abundant nocturnal frugivores that rely primarily on Piper fruits as a food resource. Previous research has demonstrated that Carollia employs olfaction and echolocation to locate Piper fruit, but it is unknown how their sensory use and foraging decisions are influenced by the complex diversity of chemical cues that fruiting plants produce. Using free-ranging C. castanea and their preferred food, Piper sancti-felicis, we conducted behavioral experiments to test two main hypotheses: (1) foraging decisions in C. castanea are primarily driven by ripe fruit scent and secondarily by vegetation scent, and (2) C. castanea re-weights their sensory inputs to account for available environmental cues, with bats relying more heavily on echolocation in the absence of adequate scent cues. Our results suggest that C. castanea requires olfactory information and relies almost exclusively on ripe fruit scent to make foraging attempts. Piper sancti-felicis ripe fruit scent is chemically distinct from vegetation scent; it is dominated by 2-heptanol, which is absent from vegetation scent, and has a greater abundance of β-caryophyllene, β-ocimene, γ-elemene, and α-cubebene. Although variation in echolocation call parameters was independent of scent cue presence, bats emitted longer and more frequent echolocation calls in trials where fruit scent was absent. Altogether, these results highlight the adaptations and plasticity of the sensory system in neotropical fruit bats.",

Genus Rousettus have their morphological variances among its own species based on characteristics on each species. Among them there is fruit-feeding bats of from genus Rousettus (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) that have many variances of morphology among its own species. This study was aimed to identify the morphological variations and its sex type influence of genus Rousettus bats from Gunung Duasudara Sanctuary, North Sulawesi. The locations were consisted 7 types of major vegetations at altitude range from 0 to 1351 m above sea level (asl). All habitat types were observed using Mist-net method at 1 and 3 m above the ground. There were found 452 individuals, including R. amplexicaudatus (224), R. celebensis (219) and R. tangkokoensis n. sp. (9). Nine individuals of Rousettus tangkokoensis n. sp. were newly found in lowland forest and coastal forest. These newly-found species were different from other Rousettus. There was discovered that sex type had influenced the skull and external body characters on R. amplexicaudatus, R. tangkokoensis n. sp. R. celebensis. However, most of other characters were statistically not-significant that indicated there was not any sexual dimorphism. According to the Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA), these morphological groups possess different specification. Therefore, the three species of genus Rousettus have statistically variation of skull and external body characters one to another.",

Four females were monitored for up to 7 d. Based on 575 radiotelemetry positions, kernel home ranges were between 36.5 and 90.7 ha. During each night, bats visited most of their home range, which included forest islands and continuous forest; however activity was concentrated in core-use areas representing 6–12 percent of the home ranges. There was moderate overlap in home range and core-use areas among the four females. The mean long axis across the kernel home ranges was 1324 m. The results reported here show that S. lilium is able to move freely among forest elements in the landscape while crossing a savanna matrix. Hence, S. lilium may contribute to maintain connectivity and ecological processes in a fragmented landscape.",

Our results detected no significant differences both in body mass and in forearm length between males and females at birth. On average, young bats were not agile fliers until 31 days of age. Body mass and forearm length of pups followed a linear pattern of growth until day 13, with mean growth rates of 0.17 g/day and 1.22 mm/day, respectively, and thereafter growth rates decreased. Length of the total epiphyseal gap of the fourth metacarpal-phalangeal joint showed a linear increase up to 10 days followed by a linear decrease until day 40 with a mean rate of 0.09 mm/day. Together, two equations permitted estimation of the age of R. marshalli pups between 1 and 40 days of age. Of the three nonlinear growth models (logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy), the logistic equation provided the best fit to the empirical curves for body mass and forearm length.",

Although many bat species use different habitats during the daytime and nighttime hours, these data are rarely collected simultaneously. We radio-tagged 48 adult Raﬁnesque’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus raﬁnesquii (Lesson, 1827)) in a bottomland hardwood forest in Kentucky from 2009 to 2011. We tracked bats to 64 day roosts over 549 bat-days and found bats roosted almost exclusively in trees located in forested wetlands (n = 59; 92%), and that reproductive females established their home ranges closest to these habitats (P < 0.0001). Although few (n = 4; 6%) roosts were located in deciduous forests on drier soils, these forests were important foraging habitats for pregnant females, which foraged closest to these habitats within their home ranges (P = 0.04). Abundance of Lepidoptera differed among habitats (P = 0.03), with higher abundance in deciduous forests and along forest–ﬁeld edges. Deciduous forests were the only habitat preferentially selected by any lepidopteran family (Notodontidae), and the only habitat not avoided by any family. These data conﬁrm the importance of forested wetlands to the ecology of Raﬁnesque’s big-eared bat and demonstrate the beneﬁt of proximally located deciduous forests that provide habitat for their moth prey.",

Most echolocation signals are characteristic for the subfamily (very high-frequency, broadband FM calls (sweeping down from178 kHz to 58 kHz) of low intensity and short duration « 3.0 msr), but this species also produces stereotypical calls of a markedly different structure. The arrangement of signal elements in these calls is unusual, and we present here a detailed analysis of calls from thirteen adult individuals (nine males and four females). These multiharmonic calls are of much lower frequency (fundamental peak frequency of 36 kHz), higher intensity and longer duration (12.0 ms) than the orientation calls, and are composites comprising a long quasi-constant frequency (QCF) syllable followed by an upward frequency modulated sweep (UFM). From considerations of signal design and preliminary field observations, we consider possible functions of these calls.",

            "abstractNote": "Egyptian rousette bats (ERBs; Rousettus aegyptiacus; family Pteropodidae) are associated with a growing number of bunyaviruses of public health importance, including Kasokero virus (KASV), which was first identified as a zoonosis in Uganda in 1977. In this study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from a previous experiment in which KASV infection was confirmed in 18 experimentally infected ERBs were used for an in-depth analysis using histopathology, in situ hybridization (ISH) for detection of viral RNA, immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the mononuclear phagocyte system response, and quantitative digital image analysis to investigate virus clearance from the liver and spleen within a spatial context. Significant gross and histological lesions were limited to the liver, where KASV-infected bats developed mild to moderate, acute viral hepatitis, which was first observed at 3 days postinfection (DPI), peaked at 6 DPI, and was resolved by 20 DPI. A subset of bats had glycogen depletion (n = 10) and hepatic necrosis (n = 3), rarely with intralesional bacteria (n = 1). Virus replication was confirmed by ISH in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and tongue. In the liver, KASV replicated in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, to a lesser extent in mononuclear phagocytes, and rarely in presumptive endothelial cells. Most KASV RNA, as detected by ISH, was cleared from the spleen and liver by 6 DPI. It is concluded that ERBs have effective mechanisms to respond to this virus, clearing it without evidence of clinical disease.",

The size and morphological characteristics of the uterus were found to be highly relevant to mating and the delivery period. In particular, some of the sperm ejaculated to the female reproductive tract became extinct due to phagocytosis by leukocytes starting from the end of August, which continued until the end of February. Accordingly, this period may be called the cleansing period. The sperm became extinct mainly in the uterine lumen, and an extremely small amount of sperm became extinct by secretion from the uterine gland and the phagocytosis by leukocytes. Such phagocytosis seemed to result in maintaining the clean intrauterine environment to facilitate the implantation of the fertilized egg. Also, phagocytosis by leukocytes was considered as a physiological mechanism to kill the sperm breaking into the female reproductive tract by recognizing them as alien materials, to maintain an appropriate number of sperm at the fertilization site of the fallopian tubes, so as to improve fertility. Only the sperm reaching the caudal isthmus of oviduct were found to be involved in fertilization in the next year. Ovulation and fertilization occurred approximately at the end of March. Embryogenesis appeared consecutively with implantation. The pregnancy period was approximately 70 days; delivery occurred approximately early- and middle June; and the nurturing period was approximately 80 days.",

The purpose of our study was to analyse Plagiorchis spp. from European bats using a combination of morphological and molecular-phylogenetic approaches and to establish the taxonomic position of the problematic species P. mordovii. Plagiorchis spp. were shown to be variable morphologically and morphometrically both from various host species and from different specimens of the same species. We presented a new taxonomic key for identification of the Plagiorchis spp. from European bats, provided a complete description of Plagiorchis mordovii, and confirmed the validity and the generic affiliation of this species.",

The species is noted for its long hibernation period with low mortality rate. We investigated the morphology of E. nilssonii blood cells during hibernation, hematological parameters including hemoglobin level, red blood cell (RBC) count, total white blood cell (WBC) count, and differential WBC count. The study revealed changes of several hematological parameters in hibernating bats, with some variation during the hibernation season. Hibernating E. nilssonii were found to have a low total WBC count similar to other hibernators; no significant variation in WBC count was noted during hibernation. Differential leukocyte count showed a significant reduction in total monocytes in winter (in the middle of the hibernation period). Total lymphocyte, band neutrophil, and basophil counts increased in spring (termination of the hibernation period).",

The hypothesis is successful in explaining patterns of testosterone secretion in many avian species, but remains comparatively unexplored in mammals. ‘Circulating plasma testosterone levels (T)’ were studied in relation to harem maintenance in grey-headed flying-foxes,\n              Pteropus poliocephalus\n              . In this species, harems provide mating opportunities and so a male's ability to maintain a harem is likely to correlate with his fitness. We hypothesized that if T reflect a male's ability to withstand challenges from competitors, then T should be linked to successful harem maintenance. To test this, we temporarily removed males from their territories prior to and during the short mating period, recording their harem sizes both before removal and after reintroduction. Most males successfully reclaimed their territory and a harem, but during the mating period, males with higher T had harems closer to their original size, and males with lower T suffered reduction in harem size. Our findings highlight the role of T in harem maintenance in a major mammalian taxon with complex forms of social organization.",

            "abstractNote": "The reproductive beneﬁts of maintaining a high body temperature (Tb) are well understood, but costs may be prohibitively high. Many small mammals raise offspring in insulated nests, burrows, or roosts, and may form communal maternity colonies, all of which are behaviors that reduce the costs of maintaining Tb. However, some temperate-zone bats are solitary and raise young in exposed roosts. Little is known about how these species maintain energy balance in the face of high thermoregulatory costs, and whether they stay warm invariably for reproductive beneﬁts, or use a more adaptive thermoregulatory strategy. We studied Tb patterns in response to foraging conditions, weather, and pup age in free-ranging adult and juvenile hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). Lactating females regularly entered torpor, although its use was most extensive following poor foraging conditions, during inclement weather, and when pups were young. Juvenile L. cinereus appeared capable of staying warm from 3 days of age, but used torpor throughout development, gradually decreasing its use as they grew. Our results indicate that for this species, torpor is important throughout lactation, and torpor use changes in response to individually speciﬁc trade-offs between energetic cost and developmental beneﬁt. We suggest that the costs of active thermoregulation during early development of L. cinereus pups outweigh the beneﬁts of staying warm, and an extended growing season (as a result of their migratory nature) is more conducive to using torpor. Finally, we suggest that torpor use during lactation is dynamic and adaptive. Fine-scale changes within reproductive stages need to be considered, rather than broadly assessing thermoregulatory behavior among stages.",
