            "abstractNote": "Cochlear morphology has been regarded as one of the key traits to understand the origin and evolution of echolocation in bats, given its functionality and performance for receiving echolocation sonar. While numerous researchers have compared adult-stage morphology, few have studied the prenatal development of the cochlea. Here, we provide the first detailed three-dimensional description of the prenatal cranial development in bats, using Rhinolophus thomasi as a model, with particular interest to the petrosal which houses the cochlea. Results revealed that among all cranial bones the onset of the ossification of the petrosal is earlier in R. thomasi when compared to other reported mammals. Generally, the cochlea reaches adult size and shape before or around birth in placental mammals including bats, but we found that its shape and size growths continue until maturity in Rhinolophus species. The relationship of cochlear size and skull size is maintained constant throughout the postnatal ontogeny to adulthood in Rhinolophus, a pattern previously reported neither in any other bats nor other mammals. The peculiar developmental pattern in Rhinolophus possibly allows them to form their characteristically large cochlea and facilitate their distinctive echolocation behavior. A recent study reported that non-echolocating Pteropodidae shares a similar prenatal cochlear size to laryngeal echolocating bats. The apparent resemblance of fetal cochlear size was proposed to be a vestigial signal of large cochlear size in the last common ancestor of bats and thus as supporting evidence for the single origin of laryngeal echolocation. However, results from the present observations suggest that limited aspects of the cochlear development were captured in this previous investigation and that the resulting interpretations may be questionable. We point out that diversity and patterns of cochlear development among bats are still not resolved, and the controversy on the origins of laryngeal echolocation is still open to discussion.",

Few studies of phenology exist for any hibernating species and those that do address species which mate during spring. We used passive transponders (PIT tags) to study hibernation phenology of little brown bats Myotis lucifugus, a species that mates prior to hibernation in the fall. We expected that adult females would emerge earliest as early parturition increases juvenile survival. We predicted that females with large fat stores should emerge earliest because of their ability to tolerate inclement spring weather at the maternity roost. We also predicted that adult males would remain active later than females to maximize mating opportunities and compensate for body mass decline during the mating period. We implanted 475 bats with PIT tags and remotely recorded immergence and emergence timing at a hibernaculum in central Canada. As expected, adult males were active signiﬁcantly later (median immergence date = 16 September 2011) than adult females (11 September 2011) and adult females emerged earlier (median emergence date = 6 May 2012) than both adult males (25 May 2012) and subadults (13 May 2012). Emergence timing was correlated with fall body condition in adult females, with fatter females emerging earlier, but not males. Our results highlight the importance of reproductive timing as an inﬂuence on hibernation phenology of mammals.",

Individuals of midge cultures reared in 10 different laboratories showed a clear reduction in the number of alleles per locus and in the level of heterozygosity compared to two natural populations sampled in southern Germany. To reconstruct the rate of genetic impoverishment under laboratory conditions, genetic diversity was monitored in a C. riparius laboratory population for 23 generations. Additionally, 11 populations originating from different laboratories were crossed, and genetic diversity was compared among pure, crossed, and natural populations. The results demonstrate that C. riparius strains used in standard toxicity tests exhibit low levels of genetic variability. In addition, our experiments show that refreshment of stocks with individuals from other laboratories is not sufﬁcient to restore genetic variation. Potential consequences of genetic impoverishment and improvements for toxicological bioassays are discussed.",

Bats were screened for Bartonella spp. by culture and confirmed by PCR and sequencing for the gltA gene. Bartonella cultures were obtained from blood specimens of 9/51 (18%) individuals from three species (Artibeus jamaicensis, Brachyphylla cavernarum, and Monophyllus redmani). Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA sequences showed that M. redmani was infected with multiple, diverse Bartonella strains, and A. jamaicensis was infected with a strain related to a strain from a congeneric host. Ectoparasite load could possibly explain observed differences in Bartonella diversity and prevalence between bat species in this community, and we suggest future research to substantiate these preliminary findings.",

            "abstractNote": "Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in critical cognitive functions including memory, planning, and spatial navigation and is commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Subregions of RSC are typically described as Brodmann areas 29 and 30, which are defined by cytoarchitectural features. Using immunofluorescence, we studied the distributions of neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, latexin, and calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) in RSC of Carollia perspicillata, Seba's short-tailed fruit bat. We observed that latexin was specifically present in areas 29a and 29b but not 29c and 30. We further identified distribution patterns of calcium binding proteins that group areas 29a and 29b separately from areas 29c and 30. We conclude first that latexin is a useful marker to classify subregions of RSC and second that these subregions contain distinct patterns of neuronal immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Given the long lifespan of Carollia, bat RSC may be a useful model in studying age-related neurodegeneration.",

In addition, species of the family are often among the most common in neotropical forests, especially in the Amazon Basin. The Brazil nut family is diverse and abundant in the Amazon and is considered to be an indicator of undisturbed or scarcely disturbed lowland forests; thus, what is learned about its evolution, ecology, and biogeography may suggest similar patterns for other Amazonian tree families. We used combined data sets derived from the\n              ndhF\n              and\n              trnL‐F\n              genes to elucidate relationships of genera in both the Old and New Worlds that have been associated with Lecythidaceae. Our molecular tree agrees with the recognition of Napoleonaeaceae and Scytopetalaceae. Within the Lecythidaceae, there is molecular support for recognizing three subfamilies: Foetidioideae, Planchonioideae, and Lecythidoideae. We then focused on genera of the Lecythidoideae and found support for recognizing\n              Allantoma\n              (when the actinomorphic‐flowered species of\n              Cariniana\n              are included in it),\n              Grias, Gustavia\n              ,\n              Corythophora, Couratari\n              , and\n              Couroupita\n              , but conclude that\n              Cariniana\n              ,\n              Lecythis\n              , and\n              Eschweilera\n              are not monoyphyletic. Because the position of the monotypic\n              Bertholletia excelsa\n              in relation to the other zygomorphic‐flowered genera is not resolved, we are not able to comment on its generic relationships.",

            "abstractNote": "Despite the ecological importance of bats, a lack of basic data, such as spaceuse needs, hinders management efforts. Therefore, we investigated home-range size in Nycticeius humeralis (Evening Bats) by radiotracking 14 individuals (5 females and 9 males) for 7–11 nights each in a pine-dominated landscape in southwestern Georgia during June–August 2008. We generated 95% and 50% adaptive kernel (AK) home ranges and 95% minimum convex polygon (MCP) home ranges and found that mean 95% AK home-range size was 155.7 ± 38.3 ha, with individual values ranging from 36.9 ha to 565.9 ha. Mean 95% MCP home-range size was 118.5 ± 29.5 ha, with individual values ranging from 33.6–456.2 ha. Home-range sizes did not differ between males and females (P = 0.35), but were larger in August (P = 0.004) than in June and July. Evening Bat home-range sizes on our study area were similar to previously documented home ranges in forested and rural landscapes. Although Evening Bats may be habitat generalists relative to foraging activity at the scale of habitat patches, multiple core areas of activity indicate selection within this scale that may be related to prey and roost availability.",

This is especially true for the endangered Eumops floridanus (Florida bonneted bat). Scant knowledge of the species’ natural history and ecological interactions has precluded the development of effective conservation strategies. We investigated several aspects of the social organization of E. floridanus roosting in bat houses in southwest Florida: group size, group composition, group stability, and seasonality of reproduction. Our findings suggest the species has characteristics more common to tropical bat species than temperate ones. The average roost size was 10 individuals, with colonies in a harem social structure all three times in the year they were assessed. Adults were much more likely than sub-adults to be recaptured at the same roosts during subsequent capture sessions. We suggest that the availability and distribution of roosts may alter the social structure of these bats and ultimately limit local populations. We did not find evidence of a distinct seasonal birthing period matching that of other temperate bat species. Results suggests the species is aseasonally polyestrous, making non-volant E. floridanus vulnerable to disturbance across a larger portion of the year than other bat species in the US.",

It is endemic to Jamaica and formerly known only from Stony Hill Cave, where there are an estimated c.  individuals. Previously declared extinct twice, its rediscovery in  at Stony Hill Cave marked new hope for the conservation of this important species. Although little is known about its ecology, the species is presumed to be a cave-obligate rooster and to rely exclusively on so-called hot caves, which are defined by high ambient temperatures and low air quality. In March–April , we surveyed bats at seven caves throughout Jamaica. At two of these, Green Grotto Caves, St. Ann, and Rock Spring Caverns, St. Mary, we captured both male and pregnant female P. aphylla. At Green Grotto Caves, we captured  P. aphylla, and  at Rock Spring Caverns. We believe Rock Spring Caverns to be one of the largest known roosts of P. aphylla. Neither of these sites are hot caves as both are moderated by flowing water, although warmer chambers may be more important to this bat than to other species. Further monitoring of these populations and continued exploration of other potential roosts are vital for the protection of this species.",

Tumor types identiﬁed include ﬁbrosarcoma, cutaneous lymphoma, benign focal bronchioloalveolar neoplasm, anaplastic sarcoma, and sebaceous epithelioma. To the author’s knowledge, aside from a recent report of focal brochioloalveolar adenoma,8 these tumor types have not previously been described in the Rousettus species, nor in chiropterans in general. Based upon these ﬁndings and other recent publications regarding R. aegyptiacus, neoplasia does appear to be a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and mortality in captive members of this megachiropterid species.",

Although fruit bats are potentially exposed to pesticides during their entire lifespan, the impacts of this exposure are still poorly investigated. We examined the effects of low, commercially recommended concentrations (0, 1.05 and 2.1 g/l) of an organochlorine insecticide endosulfan (EDS) formulation on oxidative responses in the liver and kidneys of Neotropical fruit bats (Artibeus lituratus), as well as possible liver morphological alterations following a 35-day oral exposure. Superoxide dismutase activity was signiﬁcantly decreased upon exposure to 1.05 g/l of EDS in the liver and kidneys, catalase was decreased in the liver of 2.1 g/l EDS-exposed bats, while glutathione Stransferase was increased in the liver of 2.1 g/l EDS-exposed bats. Protein carbonyls increased following the exposure to the highest EDS dose tested. Endosulfan-induced morphological alterations in the liver included cell degeneration and cell death, with apparent cytoplasm lipid accumulation (steatosis) and pyknotic nuclei, karyolysis and deposit of collagen ﬁbres. Our ﬁndings suggest that exposure to low concentrations of EDS induced a certain extent of oxidative damage in fruit bats, which may have led to liver morphological alterations.",

However, for individuals occupying spatially limited structures, such as tree cavities, group formation may inﬂuence—and be inﬂuenced by—the range of structures available for use. This may be especially true of bats, which often form maternity groups that regularly change in size. We examined colonies of tree-roosting little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (LeConte, 1831)) in northern Alberta to address two questions: (1) is group size associated with patterns of roost use, in particular the use of large-diameter trees, and (2) does group size change during reproduction and correspond to changes in roost use? We located roosts over 2 years using radiotelemetry and conducted exit counts at a subset of these roosts. Larger diameter trees had larger and more variable group sizes. Roost-tree diameter peaked near the start of parturition, the time when bats formed the largest groups. We suggest that large groups are especially beneﬁcial at this time due to the thermoregulatory beneﬁts to small, unfurred pups. Our results indicate that roost use and group size are interrelated and that large-diameter trees may be especially beneﬁcial by supporting a wider range of group sizes.",

NJ analysis shows polyphyly of Insectivora and Chiroptera. Assuming that each of Primates, Ferungulata, Chiroptera, Insectivora and Rodentia is a monophyletic group, ML analysis suggests that Chiroptera is a sister group of Insectivora and that Ferungulata is the closest outgroup to the (Insectivora and Chiroptera) clade.",

These include three uninterrupted (CA)n repeats, ranging in length from (CA)17 to (CA)19, one interrupted repeat (CA)4(CG)2(CA)13, and one uninterrupted (GA)27 repeat. All loci were highly polymorphic, with 17–20 alleles identified per locus. Observed heterozygosity levels (0.66–0.82) are lower than expected due to homozygote excess, probably caused by pooling of populations, resulting in population substructuring. All five polymorphic loci were also successfully amplified in the closely related M. fraterculus. Two pairs of primers additionally amplified polymorphic microsatellites in Chaerophon sp.",

Far less is known about Msum and metabolic expansibility [ME, the ratio of Msum to basal metabolic rate (BMR)] in bats compared with many other endotherm taxa. We measured BMR and Msum during winter and summer in captive and wild populations of a pteropodid from the southern subtropics, Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) in Pretoria, South Africa. The Msum of fruit bats ranged from 5.178±0.611 W (captive, summer) to 6.006±0.890 W (captive, winter), and did not vary significantly between seasons. In contrast, BMR decreased by 17–25% in winter. The combination of seasonally stable Msum but flexible BMR resulted in ME being significantly higher in winter than in summer, ranging from 7.24±1.49 (wild, summer) to 13.11±2.14 (captive, winter). The latter value is well above the typical mammalian range. Moreover, both Msum and ME were significantly higher in captive bats than in wild individuals; we speculate this represents a phenotypic response to a reduction in exerciseassociated heat production while in captivity. Our data for E. wahlbergi, combined with those currently available for other chiropterans, reveal that Msum in bats is highly variable compared with allometrically expected values for other mammals.",

Does this differ entiation arise purely from the use of distinct feeding habitats or, alternatively, do the species exert active prey selection within their feeding habitats? To answer this question, we compared the distribution of prey in the species’ diets with that in their respective feeding habitats, looking for discrepancies with respect to taxon and/or size. Although the general correlation is fairly good, some local discrepancies arise: (1) M. myotis underexploited small prey items (&lt;0.05 g dry weight), and (2) M. blythii overexploited cockchafers (Melolontha melolontha) and underexploited ground arthropods. We argue, however, that these discrepancies do not result from active prey selection, but from (1) the low availability of some categories of prey (due to either low detectability or low accessibility) and (2) the opportunistic exploitation of atypical feeding habitats. In fact, our results do not falsify the parsimonious hypothesis that the two species exert no active prey selection within their feeding habitats. We are furthermore not aware of any paper from the bat literature that provides definite support for active prey selection among insectivorous vespertilionids. Their echolocation system may actually preclude it.",

            "abstractNote": "Breeding of the threatened long-tailed bat Chalinolobus tuberculatus was studied over seven summers, 1993±2000, in temperate rainforest, Fiordland, New Zealand. Reproductive history of 789 marked bats from three social groups was investigated. Seventy per cent of births occurred over a 10-day period in midDecember. Young began ¯ying at 5±6 weeks and nipples of reproductive females were regressing 2 weeks later. Sex ratio at birth was equal. Lactation coincided with highest annual air temperatures and peak abundance of ¯ying invertebrates. Date of ®rst birth varied by 4 days annually, but date of ®rst ¯ight varied by 17 days. Males had distended cauda epididymides at 1 year old (mean  se = 1.63  0.16 years) and epididymal distension peaked in early autumn. Females ®rst gave birth at 2±3 years of age (2.33  0.08 years). The short, highly synchronous breeding season, birth of single young, early mating in autumn, and late age of female sexual maturity compared to similar-sized vespertilionids, may be related to low food availability and unpredictable cold-temperate weather conditions. Annual productivity did not differ among groups but probability of survival of juveniles varied from 0.26 to 0.88 and was inversely proportional to size of natal group. Variability in breeding parameters was unrelated to climate or body condition of bats. The group with highest survival rates contained reproductive females and juveniles with signi®cantly higher body condition. Differences in roost site or food quality within the home range of each group, varying genetic quality of members of the groups, or density-dependent mechanisms, may explain differential survival, but these hypotheses require investigation. A population crash and poor productivity in 1996 coincided with an irruption in the numbers of stoats Mustela erminea implying that predation by introduced animals can cause periodic population crashes. These results should be used to examine implications of these hypotheses on the long-term viability of Chalinolobus populations.",

Detector units recorded the number of bats passing per hour as an index of activity. Habitat use patterns were compared with longtailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) sampled concurrently. Activity levels in lesser short-tailed bats varied significantly among five habitat types and amongst hours of the night. Of the total activity recorded, most passes (82.6% of n = 657 bat passes) were in red beech forest >200 m from the forest edge; 13.7% were in silver beech within 100 m of forest edges, 2.6% were along roads through forest, 0.9% were on the forest-grassland edge, and 0.2% were in the open grassland. Lesser short-tailed bats were active throughout the night but especially at dawn and dusk. There was no correlation between levels of activity by lesser short-tailed bats and overnight minimum or dusk temperatures. Patterns of habitat use and activity in long-tailed bats were significantly different from those of lesser short-tailed bats.",

We investigated male attendance at big brown bat maternity roosts in a Colorado study area that shows a pattern of sexual segregation by elevation. We tested multiple predictions of three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses to explain male attendance patterns: 1) sex-specific differences in energetic strategies of males and females are maintained at the lower elevation; 2) natal philopatry of inexperienced young males accounts for most attendants; 3) males gain a reproductive advantage for late summer mating at maternity roosts. We tested predictions based on captures of bats at emergence, automated monitoring of annual, seasonal, and daily roost attendance by known-age bats tagged with passive integrated transponders, and anatomical evidence for mating. Findings were most consistent with the first two hypotheses. Adult males accounted for just 3.1% of 8,192 captures of bats at 285 evening emergences from 46 roosts during 2001–2005. Daily attendance rates of males during each active season (0.10 detections/day at age 1 year and 0.20 detections/day at ≥ 2 years old) were lower than in females (0.34 at age 1 year and 0.45 at ≥ 2 years old). Only 92 of 299 males tagged as volant juveniles were detected as adults at five maternity roosts monitored 2002–2005, far fewer than female returns in every age category. We detected known-age adult males almost exclusively at their natal roosts and most males that returned (91 of 92) in years after tagging as juveniles were first detected as 1-year-olds; 20 of 21 individuals that returned at 2–4 years of age were previously detected as 1-year-olds. One-year-old males were re-encountered at annual rates 5–16 times higher than 2- to 4-year-old males, and 1-year-old males and females had lower daily attendance rates than older bats. The male reproductive advantage hypothesis was not well supported. None of 80 females examined in late summer had evidence of insemination, and not all males showed distended scrota. Daily attendance rates of tagged adult males (n = 155) and females (n = 788) were lowest during late summer, suggesting that little reproductive advantage was accrued by males utilizing maternity roosts. Attendance of male big brown bats at maternity roosts at our study area is consistent with the sex-specific energetic strategies and natal philopatry hypotheses, and mating probably occurs at higher elevation autumn roosts and hibernacula.",

Of these, one isolate was resistant to chlortetracycline and streptomycin, and nine were resistant to sulfadimethoxine (SDMX). Half of these (n = 5) resistant isolates had the transmissible R plasmid for antimicrobials suggesting that OLHB is a species that hardly harbors antimicrobial‐resistant\n              Enterobacteriaceae.\n              One possible reason for this low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is that the bat lives in a clean environment with no or only very low artificial drug contaminations due to low contact with such as livestock that frequently carries antibiotic‐resistant bacteria. This study suggests that it's important to monitor antimicrobial resistance of\n              Enterobacteriaceae\n              in OLHB as a model for natural R plasmid transfer in a natural environment without specific pathological bacteria and artificial drugs.",

The genetic diversity of T. rangeli and its association with host species (triatomines and mammals) has been identiﬁed along Central and the South America; however, it has not included data of isolates from Ecuador. This study reports infection with T. rangeli in 18 genera of mammal hosts and ﬁve species of triatomines in three environments (domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic). Higher infection rates were found in the sylvatic environment, in close association with Rhodnius ecuadoriensis. The results of this study extend the range of hosts infected with this parasite and the geographic range of the T. rangeli genotype KP1(-)/lineage C in South America. It was not possible to detect variation on T. rangeli from the central coastal region and southern Ecuador with the analysis of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) gene, even though these areas are ecologically different and a phenotypic subdivision of R. ecuadoriensis has been found. R. ecuadoriensis is considered one of the most important vectors for Chagas disease transmission in Ecuador due to its wide distribution and adaptability to diverse environments. An extensive knowledge of the trypanosomes circulating in this species of triatomine, and associated mammal hosts, is important for delineating transmission dynamics and preventive measures in the endemic areas of Ecuador and Northern Peru.",

This tick is found throughout the northeastern, coastal southeastern, and upper midwestern United States and is considered the most significant vector of tick-borne pathogens to humans in North America. Despite its ubiquity and broad host range, I. scapularis previously has not been reported feeding on bats (Chiroptera). However, during 2019 and 2020, larvae and nymphs of I. scapularis were recovered from big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus (Palisot de Beauvois), at four locations in rural NewYork State, USA. All Ixodes infested bats were injured and found on the ground; therefore, parasitism by I. scapularis was likely opportunistic. Nonetheless, the large number of pathogens known to be associated with bats and the frequency with which I. scapularis bites people suggest that this host–tick relationship is of at least potential epidemiological significance.",

            "abstractNote": "In recent years, there has been an increasing risk of hematophagous bat attacks in Latin America, where livestock production is a basic source of food for local populations. In Ecuador, livestock represented an important part of agricultural output. Some cases of cattle bitten by bats in the province of Santa Elena have been reported; however, no previous studies have been conducted to determine the magnitude of the attacks and the associated risk factors. In this research, a cross-sectional descriptive study was performed recording attacks of hematophagous bats (Desmodus rotundus) through visual inspection of livestock and the capture of specimens by mist nets. Generally, the prevalence of D. rotundus attacks on farms was 69%, whereas attacks on bovine had 24% of prevalence. From the captured specimens, 93% were identiﬁed as D. rotundus and within the 30% of the captured D. rotundus, no infections for rabies virus were diagnosed. The univariable analysis used for estimating the risk factors associated with bat attacks showed that corrals away from populated centers present the highest risk (odds ratio [OR] = 19.864; p = 0.0004), followed by tree density >30 per hectare (OR = 16.313; p < 0.0001) and predatory birds of bats (OR = 15.375; p < 0.0001); a binary logistic regression model showed ‘‘corrals away from populated centers’’ (OR = 23.47; p = 0.006) as the main risk factor. Linear regression analysis showed good correlation between the number of bovines attacked and the number of bites (R2 = 0.977; p < 0.0001) suggesting some feeding patterns of D. rotundus. This study could be used as a starting point for understanding the feeding habits of D. rotundus and factors governing their attacks in coastal regions of Ecuador, and potential occurrences of rabies infections. With this knowledge, surveillance and control programs can be supported to improve rabies transmission monitoring.",

All species are known from Western Siberia and belong to the Siberian–Far Eastern bat ectoparasite fauna complex. The parasite hosts are the eastern water bat Myotis petax Hollister, 1912, and Hilgendorf’s tube-nosed bat Murina hilgendorﬁ Peters, 1880 (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae). An identiﬁcation key for females of the genus Macronyssus Kolenati, 1858, in the boreal Palearctic region is presented.",

            "abstractNote": "The claustrum is a gray‐matter structure that underlies neocortex and reciprocates connections with cortical and subcortical targets. In lower mammals, the claustrum is directly adjacent to neocortex, making the definition of claustral boundaries challenging. Latexin, an endogenous inhibitor of metallocarboxypeptidases, localizes to claustral cells, enabling a clear delineation of claustrum. Given its proportionately large claustrum, we hypothesized that the short‐tailed fruit bat,\n              Carollia perspicillata,\n              can be a useful model for claustral structure–function relations. We used latexin immunohistochemistry to identify claustral boundaries and intrinsic structure and multielectrode recordings from brain slices to explore intrinsic excitatory connectivity of the claustrum.\n            \n            \n              Carollia's\n              claustrum contains cells whose intrinsic connectivity and alignment permit the generation of spontaneous, synchronous population events and mirror their pattern of spread in disinhibited brain slices over millimeters.\n              Carollia\n              shows cellular alignment and spontaneous population‐activity spread along both horizontal and dorsoventral axes.\n              Carollia\n              claustrum possesses intrinsic excitatory connectivity sufficient to: 1) generate single, spontaneous, synchronized burst discharges, 2) support activity spread along axes where claustral cells are aligned, and 3), because of multiple axes for cell alignment, support activity spread along both rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes. The smaller event sizes in bat claustrum compared with rat claustrum are consistent with events occurring in population subsets rather than the full claustral cell population. The overall size of claustrum, its pronounced vascularity, and its more complex intrinsic connectivity than rat suggest that the bat is an animal model for claustral structure and function that will permit unique access to claustrum's processing capabilities.

We screened 125 individuals from two different bat colonies and found that polymorphism ranged from five to 13 alleles. Heterozygosity ranged from 63 to 95%. The primers amplified across 14 bat species, indicating their potential utility for population-level studies in several closely related bat species.",

We studied harems of 4–20 females associated with a dominant male in small groups of Artibeus jamaicensis (,14 females), and with dominant and subordinate males in large groups (.14 females). Dominant males displayed defensive behavior toward satellite males when they intruded into the roosting site. Small groups received the highest number of visits by satellite males, and dominant males did not display total defense of females. During the breeding season, females roosted in highly compacted clusters and dominant males were more active in their defensive behavior. Subordinate males were generally tolerated in harem groups and their presence reduced the number of adult male visits. Some young in large harem groups were sired by subordinate males, resulting in a genetic beneﬁt for both dominant and subordinate males. Dominant males had the highest ﬁtness in the large harem groups by sharing paternity with related subordinate males and by rejecting unrelated intruders.",

A total of 84 adults captured in two caves exhibited little genetic differentiation between caves (FST = 0.008). Average relatedness among adult females in 10 harem groups was very low (R = 0.014 ± 0.011), providing no evidence of harem structure. Dominant and subordinate males shared paternity in large groups, while dominant and satellite males shared paternity in smaller groups. However, our results suggest that male rank influences paternity. Dominant males fathered 69% of 40 offspring, followed by satellite (22%) and subordinate males (9%). Overall adult male bats are not closely related, however, in large harem groups we found that subordinate and dominant males exhibited relatedness values consistent with a father-offspring relationship. Because dominant and subordinate males also sired all the pups in large groups, we propose that their association provides inclusive fitness to them.",

The endemic ﬁsh-eating myotis (Myotis vivesi) is restricted to a few insular ecosystems in the Gulf of California, where it feeds on both marine and terrestrial prey; yet it is unknown whether its diet covaries with marine primary productivity. We determined the relative contribution of marine and terrestrial food sources to the diet of the ﬁsh-eating myotis to test the hypothesis that seasonal changes in oceanic primary productivity would dictate general feeding patterns of this bat species. We predicted that marine food would predominate in the diet of the bat during winter followed by an increase in importance of terrestrial food sources as summer approached. We measured amount of feces deposited in the day roost per bat and extrapolated this value to estimate amount of feces deposited in 1 year by the ﬁsh-eating myotis population in Partida Norte Island. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of bat blood and examination of food remains in feces showed that marine food was the main source of nutrients for ﬁsh-eating myotis throughout the year. Importance of terrestrial food was marginal during most of the year, with a modest increase in summer. Estimated annual feces production was up to 1,518 kg. Because of its predominantly marine feeding habits, ﬁsheating myotis transfer allochthonous nutrients to islands where they roost, subsidizing the nutrient and energy economy of the islands.",

Litomosoides molossi Esslinger, 1973 was recovered from the thoracic and abdominal cavities of Molossus molossus (prevalence [P] ¼ 6.4%); Litomosoides chandleri Esslinger, 1973 from Artibeus planirostris (P ¼ 6.9%), Sturnira oporaphilum (P ¼ 66.6%), Sturnira erythromos (P ¼ 23.8%), Sturnira lilium (P ¼ 7.2%), and Eumops perotis (P ¼ 50%); and Litomosoides saltensis n. sp. was collected from Eptesicus furinalis (P ¼ 1.7%). In this paper, we emend the description of L. molossi; describe a new species, Litomosoides saltensis n. sp., on the basis of 1 female specimen; and report for the ﬁrst time L. molossi and L. chandleri parasitizing Argentinean bats, expanding the host and locality records. Litomosoides molossi exhibits a slender buccal capsule, with an anterior segment transparent, and the posterior chitinous portion displays 2 thickenings in the ﬁrst third; possesses 1 dorsal prominent cephalic papilla and 4 labial papillae distributed around the mouth; cuticle with lateral punctuations all along the hypodermic chords in both sexes; and male with area rugosa and tail without cloacal papillae. In L. chandleri, the lateral punctuations are distributed on the posterior extremity of the body in both sexes. Litomosoides saltensis n. sp. displays a thick buccal capsule with a posterior segment well cuticularized, possessing 2 thickenings in the anterior half; 4 labial and 2 ventral cephalic papillae; a globular vulva located anterior to the esophagus–intestine junction; cuticle with lateral punctuations in the posterior extremity of the body; and tail with salient phasmids. We also provide a taxonomic key for the identiﬁcation of the Litomosoides sp. of bat dwelling. Long-term studies and large sample sizes are needed to detect the presence of Litomosoides sp. in bats, in contrast to the ﬁndings in cricetid rodents, which seem to be more frequently collected.",

Nondifferentially stained karyotypes were scored for 291 specimens from 5 localities. Each locality was near a locality from which similar data on U. bilobatum have been reported in the literature 18 years ago. G-tests indicated no signiﬁcant differences between our data and the historical data at 2 localities in El Salvador; signiﬁcant differences were found at the contact zone in Honduras. Based on a combined sample of 834 specimens, by means of the point at which genotype frequencies equal 20% and 80% (20/80 rule), we estimated that 3 chromosomal morphs (designated Aa, Bb, and Cc) had an average clinal width of 33.3 km. The widest cline, Bb, was 12.53 km wider than the narrowest, Cc. Morph Cc was detected at 2 localities, 72 and 80 km northwest of the nearest locality from which it was previously known. Overall, we detected little change in clinal architecture during the intervening years between these 2 analyses. Four investigators who used the same data set have published 4 different interpretations of clinal dynamics. These interpretations are mutually contradictory and so all cannot be correct.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats (Chiroptera) constitute the second largest order of mammals and have several distinctive features, such as true self-powered flight and strong immunity. The Pendlebury’s roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pendleburyi, is endemic to Thailand and listed as a vulnerable species. We employed the 10Â Genomics linked-read technology to obtain a genome assembly of H. pendleburyi. The assembly size was 2.17 Gb with a scaffold N50 length of 15,398,518 bases. Our phylogenetic analysis placed H. pendleburyi within the rhinolophoid clade of the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. A synteny analysis showed that H. pendleburyi shared conserved chromosome segments (up to 105 Mb) with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Phyllostomus discolor albeit having different chromosome numbers and belonging different families. We found positive selection signals in genes involved in inflammation, spermatogenesis and Wnt signalling. The analyses of transposable elements suggested the contraction of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and the accumulation of young mariner DNA transposons in the analysed hipposiderids. Distinct mariners were likely horizontally transferred to hipposiderid genomes over the evolution of this family. The lineage-specific profiles of SINEs and mariners might involve in the evolution of hipposiderids and be associated with the phylogenetic separations of these bats from other bat families.",

However, the diversification of echolocation call structure in bats allows for considerable morphological similarity while still permitting niche differentiation based on specialisation for prey type and habitat structure. The recent separation of a common Palaearctic bat, the pipistrelle, into\n              Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n              and\n              P. pygmaeus,\n              which are sympatrically distributed throughout their range, raises the question as to whether these two morphologically similar species partition resources in time and space.\n            \n            \n              To test the hypothesis that the coexistence of these cryptic species is facilitated by differential habitat use, 14\n              P\n              .\n              pipistrellus\n              , and 12\n              P. pygmaeus\n              were radio‐tracked from adjacent maternity roosts, in northeast Scotland, from May to September 2002/2003. The two species showed distinct habitat partitioning with\n              P. pygmaeus\n              foraging predominantly in riparian woodland and over water, and\n              P. pipistrellus\n              foraging along woodland edges and short isolated tree lines. Inter‐specific overlap in habitat use was low and consequently foraging ranges were segregated spatially.\n            \n            The degree of habitat partitioning revealed in these species, which show considerable overlap in echolocation call parameters and functional morphology, suggests that morphological features, whilst useful in separating chiropteran species into coarse‐grained foraging guilds, may not predict fine‐grained ecological segregation.",

We surveyed three mule deer herds across the state of Nevada for infection with relapsing fever Borrelia spp. spirochetes. Bacterial prevalence varied by the county where deer were sampled but Borrelia spirochetes were detected in 7.7% of all deer sampled. Infected deer were identiﬁed in every location from which mule deer samples were obtained. Sequencing of the Borrelia intergenic spacer gene (IGS) revealed that one individual was infected with Borrelia coriaceae and all others were infected with Borrelia hermsii. The vector of B. hermsii, Ornithodoros hermsi (Acari: Argasidae, Wheeler, Herms, and Meyer, 1935), feeds primarily on wild rodents and has not been identiﬁed infesting deer. Additionally, Ornithodoros coriaceus (Acari: Argasidae, Koch, 1844), which readily feeds on deer and is frequently infected with B. coriaceae, has not been shown to be a competent vector for B. hermsii. Our data represent the ﬁrst sylvatic evidence of B. hermsii infection in mule deer. Additionally, our data provide evidence that infection with relapsing fever spirochetes in Nevada is wide ranging in the state’s deer populations.",

However, important information on their behaviour and movement ecology, such as the locations and altitudes at which they forage, is still fragmentary, while crucial for their conservation in light of the increasing threat posed by progressing WT construction. We adopted two different methods of microphone array recordings and GPS-tracking capturing data from different spatio-temporal scales in order to gain a complementary understanding of the echolocation and movement ecology of\n              Nyctalus aviator\n              , the largest open-space bat in Japan. Based on microphone array recordings, we found that echolocation calls during natural foraging are adapted for fast flight in open-space optimal for aerial-hawking. In addition, we attached a GPS tag that can simultaneously monitor feeding buzz occurrence, and confirmed that foraging occurred at 300 m altitude and that the flight altitude in mountainous areas is consistent with the turbine conflict zone, suggesting that the birdlike noctule is a high-risk species in Japan. Further investigations on this species could provide valuable insights into their foraging and movement ecology, facilitating the development of a risk assessment regarding WTs.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS)-positive little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) may exhibit immune responses including increased cytokine and pro-inflammatory mediator gene levels. Bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins) formed by enzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids can contribute to these immune responses, but have not been investigated in WNS pathophysiology. Nonenzymatic conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids can also occur due to reactive oxygen species, however, these enantiomeric isomers will lack the same signaling properties. In this study, we performed a series of targeted lipidomic approaches on laboratory Pseudogymnoascus destructans-inoculated bats to assess changes in their splenic lipidome, including the formation of lipid mediators at early stages of WNS. Hepatic lipids previously identified were also resolved to a higher structural detail. We compared WNS-susceptible M. lucifugus to a WNS-resistant species, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). Altered splenic lipid levels were only observed in M. lucifugus. Differences in splenic free fatty acids included both omega-3 and omega-6 compounds. Increased levels of an enantiomeric monohydroxy DHA mixture were found, suggesting nonenzymatic formation. Changes in previously identified hepatic lipids were confined to omega-3 constituents. Together, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress, but not an inflammatory response, is occurring in bats at early stages of WNS that precedes fat depletion. These data have been submitted to metabolomics workbench and assigned a study number ST002304.",

            "abstractNote": "White nose syndrome (WNS) is a cutaneous fungal disease of bats. WNS is responsible for unprecedented mortalities in North American cave bat populations. There have been few descriptions of enzyme activities that may function in WNS host/pathogen interactions, while no study has isolated and described secreted proteases. To address the hypothesis that Pseudogymnoascus destructans secretes extracellular proteases that function in wing necrosis during WNS infection, the object of this study was to culture P. destructans on various media, then isolate and structurally identify those proteases accumulated stably in the culture medium. We found a single dominant protease activity on minimal nutrient broth enriched with protein substrates, which was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This P. destructans serine protease (PdSP1) was isolated by preparative isoelectric focusing and concanavalin A lectin affinity chromatography. PdSP1 showed a molecular weight 27,900 (estimated by SDS-PAGE), broad pH optimum 6-8, and temperature optimum 60°C. Structural characterization of PdSP1 by MALDI-TOF MS, Orbitrap MS/MS, and Edman amino-terminal peptide sequencing matched it directly to a hypothetical protein accession from the sequenced P. destructans genome that is further identified as a MEROPS family S8A subtilisin-like serine peptidase. Two additional isoforms, PdSP2 and PdSP3, were identified in the P. destructans genome with 90% and 53% homology, respectively. P. destructans S8A serine proteases showed closer sequence conservation to P. pannorum and plant pathogenic fungi than to human pathogenic dermatophytes. Peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies developed from the PdSP1 sequence detected the protein in western blots. These subtilisin-like serine proteases are candidates for further functional studies in WNS host-pathogen interaction.",

The three genes lie in tandem within a 2.5-kb region of chromosome arm 3R. In a sample of eight alleles from a worldwide distribution we found a signiﬁcant departure from neutrality by several statistical tests. The most striking feature of this sample was that in a 1.7-kb region containing the janA and janB genes, 30 out of 31 segregating sites contained variants present only once in the sample, and 29 of these unique variants were found in the same allele. A restriction survey of an additional 28 lines of D. simulans revealed strong linkage disequilibrium over the janA-janB region and identiﬁed six more alleles matching the rare haplotype. Among the rare alleles, the level of DNA sequence variation was typical for D. simulans autosomal genes and showed no departure from neutrality. In addition, the rare haplotype was more similar to the D. melanogaster sequence, indicating that it was the ancestral form. These results suggest that the derived haplotype has risen to high worldwide frequency relatively recently, most likely as a result of natural selection.",

Pollen availability, abiotic resources, and flowering pattern can limit fruit and seed production. Open pollination and pollen supplementation studies are used to estimate any pollen limitation in natural populations. To study the impact of these factors on the reproductive success of\n              Vriesea gigantea\n              , an epiphytic bromeliad in the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil, its fertility in four natural populations in Itapuã State Park was assessed by considering plant and inflorescence size, flower production, fruit and seed set, flower and fruit set pattern, and seed viability and germination rate. Supplemental pollination in adult plants was used to determine whether fruit production in\n              V. gigantea\n              is limited by reception of pollen. The results showed that\n              V. gigantea\n              has a high production of flowers, fruits, and seeds. Seeds are highly viable in all populations, presenting an average germination rate of 94% (SE ± 3.5). Plants of\n              V. gigantea\n              from Itapuã State Park are highly fertile. The high proportion of fruit and seed set after manual hand pollination indicates that the species is self‐compatible. Pollination treatments showed evidence of pollinator limitation in the Itapuã State Park population.",

            "abstractNote": "We examined the histological structure of the kidneys of Myotis myotis to better understand their structural adaptations to dietary habits. M. myotis is an insectivorous bat species that belongs to the family Vespertilionidae. The kidneys of M. myotis are unilobular, bean-shaped, and surrounded by a renal capsule. The two parts are distinguished by a thin cortex and a thicker medulla. Renal corpuscles consist of the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule. The proximal tubule consists of cubic cells with a well-developed brush border, whereas the distal tubule is lined with a simple cubic epithelium without a brush border. The Henle's loop, located in the medullary region, was composed of flat cells. The microvilli of proximal tubule epithelial cells and basal lamina of proximal and distal tubule epithelial cells were periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive. The PAS-positive reaction of the microvilli of proximal tubular epithelial cells and basal lamina of proximal and distal tubule epithelial cells is due to the presence of glycogen, which may be used as an energy substrate during absorption. The presence of acidic glycoconjugates in the papilla was demonstrated by Alcian blue (pH 2.5)-PAS staining. According to the result of silver impregnation staining, it was determined that reticular fibers form a dense fibrillary network in the kidney parenchymal tissue. Reticular fibers are responsible for demarcating and supporting the borders of cells by forming a thin network of fibrils beneath the basal lamina of the cells. Structural features in the kidney, such as a thin cortex and thicker medulla, long conical papilla, and division of the thick medulla into inner and outer regions, of M. myotis may be an adaptation to produce concentrated urine, thereby reducing water loss associated with insectivorous feeding habits.",

For this purpose, 10 specimens of oesophagus were collected and processed. The oesophagus wall of M. myotis is composed of four layers: tunica mucosa, tunica submucosa, tunica muscularis and tunica adventitia. The mucosa is covered by a non-­keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. There were no glands in the wall of the oesophagus. Tunica muscularis is composed of two muscle layers: internal circular muscular layer and an external longitudinal muscular layer. Histochemical studies revealed that the oesophagus was AB/PAS and PAS positive indicating the presence of acidic and neutral mucosubstances. AB-­PAS staining shows that glycoproteins were predominant in the all examined layers of the oesophagus. Because of the absence of oesophageal glands in M. myotis, positive reaction with AB-­PAS staining may be due to secretion of salivary glands. Absence of oesophageal glands reflects the functional adaptation as high food passage rate for the insectivorous feeding habits of animals.",

Calls of bats landing and feeding on a platform in Wellington Zoo were also recorded. Both the lowest frequency and frequency of peak amplitude of calls were significantly affected by the situation under which calls were recorded. Although the calls of free-flying bats are different from those produced by bats foraging on the ground, it is unlikely that M. tuberculata uses echolocation to locate prey on the ground. No significant differences could be found between the calls emitted by male and female bats, and no consistent relationships were obvious between temporal and spectral call characteristics. There was some evidence to suggest that individual bats could be identified by their echolocation calls.",

Temporal and spectral parameters were measured from time-expanded calls and power spectra generated for both timeexpanded and heterodyned calls. Arti®cial neural networks were trained to classify the calls of both species using temporal and spectral parameters and power spectra as input data. Networks were then tested using data not previously seen. Calls could be unambiguously identi®ed using parameters and power spectra from time-expanded calls. A neural network, trained and tested using power spectra of calls from both species recorded using a heterodyne detector set to 40 kHz (the frequency with the most energy of the fundamental of C. tuberculatus call), could identify 99% and 84% of calls of C. tuberculatus and M. tuberculata, respectively. A second network, trained and tested using power spectra of calls from both species recorded using a heterodyne detector set to 27 kHz (the frequency with the most energy of the fundamental of M. tuberculata call), could identify 34% and 100% of calls of C. tuberculatus and M. tuberculata, respectively. This study represents the ®rst use of neural networks for the identi®cation of bats from their echolocation calls. It is also the ®rst study to use power spectra of time-expanded and heterodyned calls for identi®cation of chiropteran species. The ability of neural networks to identify bats from their echolocation calls is discussed, as is the ecology of both species in relation to the design of their echolocation calls.",

However, the pattern of call production with limb movement in terrestrially agile bats has never been investigated. We used synchronised high-speed video and audio recordings to determine patterns of association between echolocation call production and limb motion by Mystacina tuberculata Gray 1843 as individuals walked and flew, respectively. Results showed that there was no apparent linkage between call production and limb motion when bats walked. When in flight, two calls were produced per wingbeat, late in the downstroke and early in the upstroke. When bats walked, calls were produced at a higher rate, but at a slightly lower intensity, compared with bats in flight. These results suggest that M. tuberculata do not attempt to reduce the cost of terrestrial locomotion and call production through biomechanical linkage. They also suggest that the pattern of linkage seen when bats are in flight is not universal and that energetic savings cannot necessarily be explained by contraction of muscles associated with the downstroke alone.",

The objective of this study was to characterize the species assemblage, genetic diversity, and host specificity of bat flies (Nycteribiidae, Diptera) and wing mites (Spinturnicidae, Acari) found on these bat hosts in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Notably, while bat flies lay puparia on the cave walls and can thus be transmitted indirectly, wing mites require direct body contact for transmission. Morphological identification and sequencing of a 710-bp fragment of cytochrome oxidase I gene of 207 bat flies yielded 4 species, 3 on M. schreibersii and 1 on R. ferrumequinum. Sequencing of a 460-bp small subunit ribosomal RNA fragment, in all 190 collected wing mites revealed 2 species, 1 per host. In no case was a parasite associated with 1 host found on the other host. Species and genetic diversity of flies were higher in M. schreibersii, likely reflecting their host’s larger colony sizes and migratory potential. Mite species of both hosts showed similarly low diversity, likely due to their faster life history and lower winter survival. Our findings highlight a remarkably high host-specificity and segregation of ectoparasite species despite direct contact among their hosts in the roost, suggesting a defined host preference in the investigated ectoparasite species. Furthermore, the differences in ectoparasite genetic diversity exemplify the interplay between host and parasite life histories in shaping parasite population genetic structure.",

This study evaluated the trophic relations among three species of Carollia in a premontane forest of central Peru. To accomplish this, we first determined the diet composition of frugivorous bats to build a bat–fruit interaction network. We then assessed the trophic structure of the bat assemblage using a modularity analysis in the network. Carollia brevicauda and Carollia perspicillata were grouped apart from Carollia benkeithi. This partition occurred because the diet of C. benkeithi was more specialized, characterized by two Piper species, a Cyclanthaceae species, and Banara guianensis. Moreover, C. benkeithi, in contrast to its congeners, did not consume fruits of Ficus or Cecropia (canopy resources). This result and available information on the ecology of Carollia species suggest that small species of Carollia are more likely to carry out most of their feeding activities in the understory than are large species of the genus.",

            "abstractNote": "Excessive sugar consumption could lead to high blood glucose levels that are harmful to mammalian health and life. Despite consuming large amounts of sugar-­rich food, fruit bats have a longer lifespan, raising the question of how these bats overcome ­potential hyperglycemia. We investigated the change of blood glucose level in nectar-­ feeding bats (Eonycteris spelaea) and fruit-­eating bats (Cynopterus sphinx) via adjusting their sugar intake and time of flight. We found that the maximum blood glucose level of C. sphinx was higher than 24 mmol/L that is considered to be pathological in other mammals. After C. sphinx bats spent approximately 75% of their time to fly, their blood glucose levels dropped markedly, and the blood glucose of E. spelaea fell to the fast levels after they spent 70% time of fly. Thus, the level of blood glucose elevated with the quantity of sugar intake but declined with the time of flight. Our results indicate that high-­intensive flight is a key regulator for blood glucose homeostasis during foraging. High-­intensive flight may confer benefits to the fruit bats in foraging success and behavioral interactions and increases the efficiency of pollen and seed disposal mediated by bats.",

Our objectives were to examine natural Eptesicus fuscus gammaherpesvirus (EfHV) infections in their host, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), and determine whether infection is associated with disease. In tissue samples from 132 individual big brown bats, EfHV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 41 bats. Tissues from 59 of these cases, including 17 from bats with detectable EfHV genomes, were analyzed. An EfHV isolate was obtained from one of the cases, and electron micrographs and whole genome sequencing were used to confirm that this was a unique isolate of EfHV. Although several bats exhibited various lesions, we did not establish EfHV infection as a cause. Latent infection, defined as RNAScope probe binding to viral latency-associated nuclear antigen in the absence of viral envelope glycoprotein probe binding, was found within cells of the lymphoid tissues. These cells also had colocalization of the B-cell probe targeting CD20 mRNA. Probe binding for both latency-associated nuclear antigen and a viral glycoprotein was observed in individual cells dispersed throughout the alveolar capillaries of the lung, which had characteristics of pulmonary intravascular macrophages. Cells with a similar distribution in bat lungs expressed major histocompatibility class II, a marker for antigen presenting cells, and the existence of pulmonary intravascular macrophages in bats was confirmed with transmission electron microscopy. The importance of this cell type in γHVs infections warrants further investigation.",

Here we provide evidence on the consumption of leaves by Carollia perspicillata in northeastern Brazil, through records of its feeding behavior using camera traps, during the monitoring of the Gruta da Janela cave. The analysis of 12 months of monitoring revealed folivory in 7 months. Extra footage (1-min samples) allowed us to confirm C. perspicillata consuming the whole leaf (juices and fibers), which was never recorded in Neotropical bats. The record provides new insights into the diet of C. perspicillata, with an important new perspective on the feeding ecology of the species. We also highlight the use of camera traps as an important tool to monitor bat c­ olonies in permanent shelters.",

Sex differences in parasite load have been documented in many mammals, and have been attributed either to the allocation of energy to growth rather than the immune system in mammals exhibiting male-biased sexual size dimorphism or to the immunosuppressive qualities of testosterone. In addition, ectoparasites can have negative effects on body size and condition, as energy is allocated to the immune system rather than to growth and maintenance. Here, we used the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus (Shaw, 1801)) and its ectoparasites to test two predictions: (1) males are more heavily parasitized than females and (2) individuals with high ectoparasite loads will be in poorer condition and be smaller than individuals with low ectoparasite loads. Males were significantly more parasitized than females, and there was a nonsignificant trend for small males to be more parasitized than large males. Because the northern flying squirrel is not sexually dimorphic, the immunosuppressive qualities of testosterone may explain the sex differences in ectoparasite load. Ectoparasites may also influence skeletal growth rates, and males that are more susceptible to ectoparasites may simply be unable to allocate as much energy to growth and are thus structurally smaller.",

This study investigated the light microscopic morphology, morphometry and histochemistry of the skin and its glands across the cheek, withers, croup, ventral abdomen, perianal region, wing membrane, intercrural membrane and foot pad of the species. Sweat glands were absent and hypodermis was observed only in the withers, croup and ventral abdomen. The croup had the highest density of hair follicles while the perianal region had the highest density of sebaceous gland acini. The thicknesses of the dermis and epidermis were significantly high in the withers and foot pad respectively. Hair follicles and sebaceous glands were absent in the wing membrane. The sebaceous glands had melanin pigmentation at the periphery and stained positive to Alcian Blue-periodic acid Schiff at the withers and ventral abdomen. Epidermal and dermal thicknesses reported in this study were generally higher than those of Yangochiroptera bats and the presence of sebaceous glands and hair follicles in the wing membrane were variable in different bat species. This study has provided baseline information on the light microscopic morphology and morphometry of the skin and its glands across the various body regions in the African straw-coloured fruit bat. This information would be helpful in the understanding, handling, skin disease treatment and management of the bat in captivity for biomedical research purposes.",

Furthermore, in some portions of their range, it is not uncommon for them to prey upon humans. It is critical to the management of this species and for understanding the spread of bat rabies that detailed studies of D. rotundus population structure be conducted. To further such studies, we have characterized 12 microsatellite loci for this species.",

One of the most genetically divergent Lyssavirus spp. has been detected in a dead Miniopterus schreibersii bat in France. Brain samples were found positive for the presence of antigen, infectious virus and viral RNA by classical virological methods and molecular methods respectively. The complete genome sequence was determined by next‐generation sequencing. The analysis of the complete genome sequence confirmed the presence of Lleida bat lyssavirus (LLEBV) in bats in France with 99.7% of nucleotide identity with the Spanish LLEBV strain (KY006983).",

Thus, this study aimed to analyze and compare the composition, anatomy, and histology of male RAGs of bat species belonging to three of the largest (cosmopolitan) bat families: Vespertilionidae (Histiotus velatus), Molossidae (Molossus rufus), and Emballonuridae (Peropteryx leucoptera), in order to understand the variations in the bat RAGs. The results showed that the RAGs of H. velatus, M. rufus, and P. leucoptera are composed of an intra-abdominal prostatic complex, associated with the urethra, urethral glands, and a pair of inguinal bulbourethral glands; without ampullary glands or seminal vesicles. The prostatic complex can be composed of two (M. rufus and P. leucoptera) or three (H. velatus) prostatic regions, and can be compact (P. leucoptera), semi-lobed (M. rufus), or multilobed (H. velatus). Each prostatic region has unique and distinct characteristics, with the ventral region presenting a holocrine nature, exclusive to bats; while the dorsal and/or dorsolateral regions have similar characteristics to the ventral prostate of rats and to the human peripheral zone.",

Differences in the agglutination profiles were detected between epimastigotes or trypomastigotes from the two parasite populations using lectins with specificity for D-GlcNAc, D-GalNAc, D-Gal and D-Man as probe. Major variation w as observed between epimastigote forms. Additionally, the D -GlcNAc binding lectins W G A and BS II strongly interacted with the trypomastigote from both M 5 and M 2 9 stocks; this fact is evidence that these trypanosomes are distinct from Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi.",

            "abstractNote": "Dietary variation within and across species drives the eco-evolutionary responsiveness of genes necessary to metabolize nutrients and other components. Recent evidence from humans and other mammals suggests that sugar-rich diets of floral nectar and ripe fruit have favoured mutations in, and functional preservation of, the\n              ADH7\n              gene, which encodes the ADH class 4 enzyme responsible for metabolizing ethanol. Here we interrogate a large, comparative dataset of\n              ADH7\n              gene sequence variation, including that underlying the amino acid residue located at the key site (294) that regulates the affinity of ADH7 for ethanol. Our analyses span 171 mammal species, including 59 newly sequenced. We report extensive variation, especially among frugivorous and nectarivorous bats, with potential for functional impact. We also report widespread variation in the retention and probable pseudogenization of\n              ADH7\n              . However, we find little statistical evidence of an overarching impact of dietary behaviour on putative\n              ADH7\n              function or presence of derived alleles at site 294 across mammals, which suggests that the evolution of\n              ADH7\n              is shaped by complex factors. Our study reports extensive new diversity in a gene of longstanding ecological interest, offers new sources of variation to be explored in functional assays in future study, and advances our understanding of the processes of molecular evolution.",

During the summers of 2003-2004 and 2007-2008 we trapped bats in mist nets set at a bridge over the Mersey River in Kejimkujik National Park. In total we captured 42 tricolored bats (41 female and 1 male) and fitted 32 females and the single male with radio transmitters and tracked them to their roost sites daily. Characteristics of roost sites were compared to those of randomly selected, potentially available roost sites using an a priori–selected candidate set of models and ranked using AICc for model selection. In total we found 99 unique roost trees in 9 spatially distinct (8 female, 1 male) roosting areas. On average, bats spent 2.5 d in a roost tree. While conspecifics from other parts of the species’ range typically roost in tree foliage, maternity colonies of tricolored bats in Nova Scotia roosted exclusively in Usnea trichodea lichen, typically in conifers (of which 91% were spruce; Picea spp.) that were on average 212 m from water. Only 4% of the 300 random trees from the landscape contained Usnea trichodea. These trees were a mixture of softwood and hardwood (58% and 42%, respectively) and were, on average, 550 m from water. These findings represent an apparently unique relationship between lichens and bats that likely impacts many aspects of the species biology, including distribution, social structure, and parasite prevalence.",

            "abstractNote": "How teeth are replaced during normal growth and development has long been an important question for comparative and developmental anatomy. Non-standard model animals have become increasingly popular in this ﬁeld due to the fact that the canonical model laboratory mammal, the mouse, develops only one generation of teeth (monophyodonty), whereas the majority of mammals possess two generations of teeth (diphyodonty). Here we used the straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), an Old World megabat, which has two generations of teeth, in order to observe the development and replacement of tooth germs from initiation up to mineralization stages. Our morphological study uses 3D reconstruction of histological sections to uncover differing arrangements of the ﬁrst and second-generation tooth germs during the process of tooth replacement. We show that both tooth germ generations develop as part of the dental lamina, with the ﬁrst generation detaching from the lamina, leaving the free edge to give rise to a second generation. This separation was particularly marked at the third premolar locus, where the primary and replacement teeth become positioned side by side, unconnected by a lamina. The position of the replacement tooth, with respect to the primary tooth, varied within the mouth, with replacements forming posterior to or directly lingual to the primary tooth. Development of replacement teeth was arrested at some tooth positions and this appeared to be linked to the timing of tooth initiation and the subsequent rate of development. This study adds an additional species to the growing body of non-model species used in the study of tooth replacement, and offers a new insight into the development of the diphyodont condition.",

We tested whether potential differences between two long-eared bat species are consistent with character displacement or Bergmann’s rule by investigating variability in cranial morphology of Plecotus auritus and P. austriacus, which commonly occur in Central and Eastern Europe. We used 111 complete specimens from the allopatric range of P. auritus (nine localities) and sympatric P. auritus and P. austriacus (44 localities) from Poland and Ukraine. A traditional morphometric method was used to evaluate variation in cranial size between the species in their ranges. Discriminant function analysis of cranial dimensions showed larger differences between sympatric populations of P. austriacus and P. auritus than between allopatric P. auritus and a sympatric population of P. austriacus. A subsequent analysis showed that most cranial variables (excluding elements of the skull responsible for prey capture and elements partly associated with echolocation) from the sympatric population of P. auritus are smaller than those homologues from allopatric populations. Larger individuals from the allopatric population originate from the northern part of the study area; however, we did not detect an association of cranial variability with latitude pattern. The variation in size of the cranium between individuals from allopatric and sympatric ranges of P. auritus can be explained by different preferences in each range for prey that vary in hardness. P. auritus consumed signiﬁcantly more hard-bodied insects in allopatry than in sympatry. This example is one of few conﬁrmed morphological cases of competitive character displacement.",

The overall A + T content of the H-strand is 61.4% (A 32.0%, T 29.4%, C 24.1% and G 14.5%). Among the 13 protein-coding genes, most of them begin with ATG as the start codon except for ND5 with ATA and ND2 and ND3 with ATT. ND1 and ND2 genes terminate with TAG as the stop codon, Cyt b ends with AGA, COIII, ND3 and ND4 genes end with an incomplete stop codon (T– –) and the other protein-coding genes end with TAA. In Bayesian inference (BI) and Maximum likelihood (ML) trees, we found that N. noctula is a sister clade to Pipistrellus abramus, and (Nyctalus + Pipistrellus) is a sister clade to (Chalinolobus + (Eptesicus + Vespertilio)) (1.00 in BI and 100% in ML).",

            "abstractNote": "Dedicated nectarivory is a derived feeding habit that requires specialized cranial and soft-tissue morphologies to extract nectar from flowers. Nectarivory has evolved many times in terrestrial vertebrates, and in four bat families (Pteropodidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Mystacinidae). Within phyllostomids, specializations to nectarivory have been well documented in two subfamilies, Glossophaginae and Lonchophyllinae. However, nectarivory has also evolved independently in the genus Phyllostomus (subfamily Phyllostominae). Since Phyllostomus species have an omnivorous diet with a high consumption of nectar, they can be used to explore the basic morphological modifications linked to evolving a nectarivorous habit. Here, we focused on describing and comparing the morphological features potentially associated with nectarivory in Phyllostomus discolor. We present the first detailed tongue and palate morphological descriptions for P. discolor and perform skull morphometric analysis including 10 species. We found hair-like papillae on the tongue of P. discolor, a convergent feature with Glossophaginae and nectarivorous Pteropodids; these papillae likely confer an advantage when feeding on nectar. P. discolor does not show skull morphological features characteristic of nectarivorous bats, such as a long and narrow snout. We pose that the consumption of a variety of food, such as hard insects and fruits, and the large size of P. discolor relative to specialized nectarivores may create trade-offs against morphological specialization of the skull towards nectarivory. In contrast, a long and mobile tongue with hair-like papillae may be an evolutionary solution for nectar extraction that does not have a major impact on this species' ability to feed on other resources.",

The alternative trees, depicting larger number of homoplasies but with homoplasies restricted to fusion or fission events, were compatible with the morphological data in supporting the monophyly of Gerbillurus. To choose between the hypothesis based on the most parsimonious chromosomal tree and those supported by both morphology and slightly less parsimonious chromosomal trees, we performed an electrophoretic study on this group of gerbils. The conclusions are that the genus Gerbillurus is monophyletic and represents a branch that is closely related to the T. robusta group of Taterillini. The study documents that fissions and fusions must have occurred frequently and that in some cases the same fusions were acquired in two independent lineages in numbers exceeding those that are predicted by strict parsimony. The results raise questions about the validity of systematic conclusions based solely on fusion/fission data and utilizing the parsimony criterion.",

Here we illustrate both points in a survey of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences used to study the population genetics of hibernating colonies of a migrating species, the noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula). Lacking samples from Scandinavian nursery colonies, we use a North European hibernacula to suggest that Scandinavian populations are isolated from Central and East European colonies. Then, we compare genetic diversities of nursery and hibernating colonies. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly higher haplotype diversity in hibernacula, conﬁrming that they consist of individuals from different nursery colonies. Finally, we show that pairwise comparisons of the haplotype frequencies of nursery and hibernating colonies contain some information on the migration direction of the noctule bat.",

Botanical descriptions of some corolla behaviours (‘falling as a whole’) suggest bat removal of permanently closed corollas, as in D. biflora. Considering the remoteness of species of interest, we reviewed some Dillenia floral traits to hypothesise what they may mean for bat pollination of the genus. We investigated D. biflora pollen grains apertures and reviewed Dillenia literature concerning corolla behaviour and colour, and pollen apertures and presentation, including pores and staminodes. Our samples had dramatically different ratios of tricolpate to tetracolpate pollen grains, a trait that does not exclude pollination by bees. Petal colour polymorphism occurs, with mixed colours proportionately less common in flowers with corollas that open. The proportion of species with staminodes did not differ between those presumed to be pollinated by bats and others, but anthers of the former were significantly more likely to have apical pores, and stamens all had similar length or were slightly longer in the middle, whereas stamens in two distinct groups occurred in 55% of bee-­pollinated species. Pollen heteromorphy may facilitate pollination by different taxa in tropical environments. However, anther apical pores and stamen uniformity are more likely to be associated with bat-p­ ollinated species than are other morphologies. Dillenia could be a useful model to examine evolutionary aspects of colour, heteranthery, staminodes and pollen heteromorphy. Only field work will verify bat pollination and the implications of bat dependence for Dillenia species.",

Tests for population subdivision and direct observations suggest that females return to their natal sites, while males disperse. The males present in female nursery colonies are not related to the females. Paternity assessment for 46 offspring from a particular nursery colony showed that there are no males that monopolize the reproduction, and that the resident males in the colony had only a small mating success. Instead, the results suggest that females actively seek matings outside their colony. Most interestingly, it appears that a group of males about 16 km away from the nursery colony had a relatively high mating success and that this group of males may be related to the females of the nursery colonies. If this finding can be confirmed in a larger study, it may have important consequences for future conservation strategies.",

Design Clustered non-random sampling for serology, virus isolation and electron microscopy (EM). Procedure Serum samples were collected from 306 Pteropus spp. in northern and eastern Australia and tested for antibodies against Menangle virus (MenV) using a virus neutralisation test (VNT). Virus isolation was attempted from tissues and faeces collected from 215 Pteropus spp. in New South Wales. Faecal samples from 68 individual Pteropus spp. and four pools of faeces were examined by transmission EM following routine negative staining and immunogold labelling.\nResults Neutralising antibodies (VNT titres ≥ 8) against MenV were detected in 46% of black ﬂying foxes (P. alecto), 41% of grey-headed ﬂying foxes (P. poliocephalus), 25% of spectacled ﬂying foxes (P. conspicillatus) and 1% of little red ﬂying foxes (P. scapulatus) in Australia. Positive sera included samples collected from P. poliocephalus in a colony adjacent to a piggery that had experienced reproductive disease caused by MenV. Virus-like particles were observed by EM in faeces from Pteropus spp. and reactivity was detected in pooled faeces and urine by immunogold EM using sera from sows that had been exposed to MenV. Attempts to isolate the virus from the faeces and tissues from Pteropus spp. were unsuccessful.\nConclusion Serological evidence of infection with MenV was detected in Pteropus spp. in Australia. Although virus-like particles were detected in faeces, no viruses were isolated from faeces, urine or tissues of Pteropus spp.",

            "abstractNote": "Recent discoveries of several new cryptic bat species in Europe, as well as the growing concerns on bat conservation, have resulted in increased efforts to study roost site selection, habitat use and spacing/foraging behaviour. For many of these cryptic species, management is problematic due to the lack of information. We present data on space and habitat use of 14 radio-tagged Plecotus macrobullaris females from a nursery in the central part of the species’ distribution. They used home ranges larger than 10 km2, and the behavioural pattern was typically a first foraging bout soon after emergence from the nursery, followed by fast non-foraging flight towards selected habitat types. Habitat selection, as evaluated by K-select analysis, is non-random with preference for ecotones at woodland borders and rural areas, whereas woods are avoided. Body condition differentially affects habitat use for breeding and non-breeding females: breeding females in good condition showed a strong preference for ecotones. Among non-breeding females, the preference for ecotones varied with body condition. Being the sibling species of P. auritus, which is considered a woodland bat, the selection pattern observed for P. macrobullaris raises some questions about the possible niche partition in cases of sympatry.",
