            "abstractNote": "Habitat loss for food production is a problem strongly affecting wildlife. However, some species may adapt their behavior and use these habitats, such as the neotropical nectarfeeding bats (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) occurring in banana monocultures. We assessed the diet of the common nectar-feeding bat Glossophaga soricina, foraging in two habitats with different levels of alteration and land use intensities, conventional and organic banana plantations, and compared it to that from bats living in native forest patches. We collected pollen from the fur of captured bats and identiﬁed it under a microscope to the lowest taxonomical level possible. We found that bats foraging in forests have a richer diet, since they feed in more heterogeneous areas with more plant species. Additionally, bats foraging in conventional banana plantations generally showed a less diverse pollen load. One hectare of banana plantation provides an energy density that easily supports ﬁve bat individuals per night throughout the year, so plantations might be ideal foraging grounds. However, bats also require proteins, and banana cultivars produce very little or no pollen at all and additionally pesticide use makes insects a scarce resource in most plantations. Such a simpliﬁed and incomplete diet and agrochemical exposure might negatively affect the bats, but we still do not understand to what extent. Thus, we conclude that, although banana plantations represent a high nectar availability habitat, they might be less-than-perfect foraging grounds for nectarivorous bats.",

Physiography coupled with the diverse local climates has enriched the biodiversity of the Nepal Himalayas. The order Chiroptera constitutes more than 25% of the mammalian fauna and forms the most speciose group of mammals in Nepal, where bats are recorded within a wide range of elevations from 64m to 4154m. Climate variation in the past has been observed and projected change has been predicted, and an evaluation of the climate change impact on biodiversity and habitats has been initiated. However, none of the studies has assessed the impact of climate change on bats in the Himalayan range including Nepal, despite bats represent the largest mammalian group in the country. Through Species Distribution Modelling (SDM), we describe the present distribution range for ﬁve common species, further assess their response to future climatic changes. Speciﬁcally, the occurrence of bats against 10 environmental variables were projected under different climate scenarios; present, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 for 2050 and 2070 deploying maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt). We prepared predicted distribution range maps and estimated area using Arc GIS 10.7.1. Among 10 uncorrelated bioclimatic variables, six contribute to the SDM signiﬁcantly. Annual precipitation (bio12) is the most common variable for all ﬁve species. Two species shows wider present distribution ranges compared to other three. Under the climate change scenarios, although predictions varied among species, similar trends of the range shifting toward northern latitudes and higher elevations are observed. Since the larger part of the current potential distribution range lies outside protected areas, a landscape level conservation approach prioritizing bat conservation is needed. Future surveys should target ground truthing in the western region of the country.",

We assessed the potential impacts of those changes and events on the future distribution of fruit bats in Australia. Correlative species dis­ tribution modelling was used to predict the distribution of seven (based on data availability) tropical and temperate fruit bat species. We used bioclimatic variables, the number of days where temperature ≥42 ◦C (known to induce extreme heat stress and mortality in fruit bats), and land cover (a proxy for habitat) as predictors. An ensemble of machine-learning algorithms was used to make predictions for the current-day distribution and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios, using multiple emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and global circulation models (Australian Com­ munity Climate and Earth System Simulator, Hadley Centre Global Environment Model Carbon Cycle, and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate). Our results predict, under cur­ rent conditions, on average, 9.1 % and 90.8 % of the area are suitable and unsuitable, respec­ tively. Under future scenarios, on average, 6.7 % and 89.7 % continued to be suitable and unsuitable, respectively, while there was a 1.1 % gain and 2.4 % loss in suitable areas. Under current conditions, we predict, on average, 5.6 % and 3.4 % are suitable inside and outside species’ IUCN-defined range, respectively. While under future scenarios, 4.8 % (4.4 % stable and 0.4 % gain) and 2.9 % (2.2 % stable and 0.6 % gain) are suitable inside and outside the range respectively. On average, the gain in areas inside the range covers 2703.5 grid cells of size 5 km, while outside the range it is 4070.3 cells. Under future scenarios, the loss in areas is predicted to be 1.2 % and 1.1 % on average, inside and outside species range respectively. Fruit bats are likely to respond to climate change and extreme temperatures by migrating to more suitable areas, including regions not historically inhabited by those species. Our results can be used for identi­ fying areas at risk of new fruit-bat colonisation, such as human settlements and orchards, as well as areas that might be important for habitat conservation.",

Bats are one of the most diverse mammalian groups, playing vital roles in the eco­ systems. There are at least 140 bat species in China, with 30 % of being regionally threatened or data deficient. Here, we used expert elicitation to assess the key threats and conservation stra­ tegies of bats in China. We designed an online questionnaire concerning the conservation of Chinese bats, and then distributed the questionnaire to bat experts worldwide via email. All participants were asked to rank each threat and conservation strategy according to the urgency and significance. After excluding participants without some knowledge of Chinese bats and conservation biology, we gathered the opinions of 119 bat experts from China and abroad. The results showed that the scores of different threats and conservation strategies were predicted by their categories. Loss of habitat, killing and hunting, and roost disturbance were regarded as the three top threats faced by Chinese bats. Most experts recognized that banning hunting and improving the legislation were two priority strategies for bat conservation, although monitoring of bat diversity, scientific publicity, and education were also important. Nearly 98 % of the ex­ perts supported the suggestion that threatened bats should be under special state protection because of their ecological services, economic value, population decline, scientific value, and other features. These results provide valuable implications for guiding the protection and man­ agement of bats in China.",

            "abstractNote": "The increasing use of onshore wind energy is leading to an increased deployment of wind turbines in structurally rich habitats such as forests. Forest-affiliated bats, in turn, are at risk of colliding with the rotor blades. Due to the legal protection of bats in Europe, it is imperative to restrict the operation of wind turbines to periods of low bat activity to avoid collisions. However, bats have also been observed to avoid wind turbines over several hundred meters distance, indicating a displacement that cannot solely be explained by modifications to the habitat. This avoidance suggests a displacement of bats by indirect factors related to wind turbine operation, e.g., wake turbulences and noise emissions. Therefore, we investigated whether the activity of forestaffiliated bats is influenced by operation mode (on/off) under variable wind conditions along transects from 80 to 450 m distance to wind turbines. We divided recordings by foraging guild, i. e., either narrow-space (Myotis, Plecotus), edge-space (Pipistrellus, Barbastella), or open-space foraging bats (Nyctalus, Eptesicus, Vespertilio), and analyzed the effects of wind turbine opera­ tion and wind speed on the recorded bat guild activity with mixed effects models. The acoustic activity of narrow-space foraging bats decreased by 77% with increasing wind speed when wind turbines were operating, while bat activity remained unaffected by wind speed when turbines were not operating. This was neither observed for open-space foraging bats nor for edge-space foraging bats, and neither wind turbine operation nor wind speed (ranging between 0 – 4 m/s at 10 m height above ground) were found to affect bat activity when considered alone. Wind turbine noise emissions are known to increase with rotor speed and consequently, wind speed, thus presenting a likely explanation for the interactive negative effect of turbine operation and wind speed specifically on noise-sensitive narrow-space foraging bats. To understand potential ecological long-term consequences for bat populations in forest areas with wind turbines and to design effective conservation measures, future research should focus on disentangling the effects of different disturbances related to turbine operation.",

The study was conducted using ten adult Wistar rats, ten fruit bats and eight pangolins comprising of both sexes. After being sacrificed by cervical dislocation, their skulls were opened using bone forceps to expose the brains. The lateral geniculate bodies were excised from each brain tissue, homogenized and homogenate studied spectrophotometrically for the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The LGB tissue samples meant for histological studies were fixed in 10% formol calcium and processed for paraffin wax embedding. Serial sections of 3μm thickness were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) and Cresyl fast violet (CFV) stains. The stained tissues were studied under the light microscope. Application of one-way ANOVA statistical method showed that there were significant differences (p<0.05) in the activities of LDH, G-6-PDH, ACP, ALP and AChE of the LGB of the three mammals as revealed in the quantitative histochemistry of these enzymes and markers. Histological observations revealed no observable differences in the relative distribution of neurons and their supporting glial cells within the LGB of the three mammalian species. The comparison of the differences observed in the histological and the quantitative histochemical activities in these mammalian species revealed a variation in the visual perception and their individual peculiarities in relation to their mode and pattern of living.",

            "abstractNote": "New data on the distribution of mammals in the dunes of Erg Chebbi (Morocco) The progressive increase of adventure tourism in the area around the dunes of Erg Chebbi has threatened, for almost two decades, the conservation of the only dune complex (Erg) of Morocco. In order to assess some of the effects of this activity on the local mammal communities, an intensive sampling was carried out between March and April 2018, based on 5 different detection methods. The main objective was to evaluate the presence and current distribution of the mammal species cited in the area since 1900. Of the 16 species historically cited, 9 have been detected in the present work, which represents 56.2%. The total absence of data on 5 of the potentially most abundant species such as Gerbillus amoenus (de Winton, 1902), Gerbillus gerbillus Olivier, 1801, Gerbillus tarabuli (Thomas, 1902), Pachyuromis duprasi Lataste, 1880 and Psammomys obesus Cretzschmar, 1828 is remarkable. Some data point to the drastic reduction of water resources experienced in recent years, as one of the causes of the apparent reduction of their populations. At the same time, other species with lower water requirement , such as Meriones libycus Lichtentstein, 1823 or Jaculus jaculus Linnaeus, 1758, have an apparent good state of conservation. The presence of Poecilictis libyca Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833 is confirmed after 32 years without being cited.",

During the study a total 19 species of bats belonging to seven families including the nationally threatened Rhinolophus rouxii were recorded of which family Vespertilionidae was the most diverse one, represented by five species. Majority of 11 species are found roosting and breeding in old temples and caves and are vulnerable from renovation activities, persecution and tourism. Therefore, long term monitoring of these sites are essential to understand the population trend over time and derive appropriate conservation implications.",

Cuba faces the impact of ticks on human health and the economy. Although Cuba has studied TBDs extensively for the past 50 years, focus on tick-borne viral pathogens affecting humans remains scant. Despite TBDs not currently being a major health concern in Cuba, factors like inadequate clinician awareness, climate conditions, global tick emergence, and evidence of zoonotic pathogens in ticks underscore the importance of enhanced TBD surveillance in the country. Here we revised the available information on ticks as vectors of pathogenic viruses to humans, spotlighting bats as potential reservoirs of tick-borne viruses (TBVs). Ticks on bats have gained interest as potential reservoirs of pathogenic viruses to humans in Cuba and worldwide. Understanding their role in maintaining viruses and their potential transmission to humans is crucial for the implementation of surveillance and control programs to reduce the risk of tick-borne viral diseases and public health management.",

While the importance of acoustic traits for foraging and communication in echolocating mammals suggests adaptation, the seldomtested null hypothesis to explain trait divergence is genetic drift. Here we derive FST values from multi-locus coalescent isolation-with-migration models, and couple them with estimates of quantitative trait divergence, or PST, to test drift as the evolutionary process responsible for phenotypic divergence in island populations of the Pteronotus parnellii species complex. Compared to traditional comparisons of PST to FST, the migration-based estimates of FST are unidirectional instead of bidirectional, simultaneously integrate variation among loci and individuals, and posterior densities of PST and FST can be compared directly. We found the evolution of higher call frequencies is inconsistent with genetic drift for the Hispaniolan population, despite many generations of isolation from its Puerto Rican counterpart. While the Hispaniolan population displays dimorphism in call frequencies, the higher frequency of the females is incompatible with sexual selection. Instead, cultural drift toward higher frequencies among Hispaniolan females might explain the divergence. By integrating Bayesian coalescent and trait analyses, this study demonstrates a powerful approach to testing genetic drift as the default evolutionary mechanism of trait differentiation between populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Most small terrestrial vertebrate accumulations in archaeological and palaeontological sites result from predation but we are far from having an exhaustive knowledge of modern predators’ diet, ecological niches and bone modification patterns especially in North African sites. The few neotaphonomic referentials available result from taxon-specialized palaeontologists’ initiatives. A survey of the literature on North Africa predators shows that their prey diversity is high and not only include rodent and shrews but also amphibians, squamates, bats and insects. We performed here a pilot taphonomic study of a Moroccan Tyto alba nest pellets including the whole taxa consumed (birds, rodents, shrews, amphibians, insects). We analyzed bone representation, fragmentation and digestion for each taxa and then compared the results. We observe differences between the taxa but on the whole find higher modification levels for this assemblage compared to roost sites of barn owls from other sites. We used for the comparisons homologous bones like the femur and the humerus and also found differences between the taxa. For example, digestion was lower on amphibians and birds than on micromammals. We discuss here some methodological issues as well as archaeological and palaeoenviromental ones by comparison with the Pleisto-Holocene site of El Harhoura II (Morocco).",

In this paper we collect all available information about the distribution of wild mammals on 47 small Italian islands. A total of 37-38 species was found, including: 1 Erinaceomorpha, 4 Soricomorpha, 16-17 Chiroptera, 3 Lagomorpha, 7 Rodentia, 2 Carnivora and 4 Artiodactyla. The subspecific level has been identified whenever possible. The mammal fauna of the Isle of Elba (Tuscan Archipelago) is the richest, with 24 species, while the most common species are Rattus rattus present on 47 islands Oryctolagus cuniculus (34), and Mus musculus (33). With the exception of Crocidura sicula, the current mammal fauna on small Italian islands originated from introductions.",

This study investigated how awareness of bats as vectors of diseases has influ­ enced their conservation in Ghana. Data were drawn from focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and questionnaire administra­ tion from five selected Ghanaian communities. The results showed that the level of awareness of bats as vectors of zoonotic diseases was high among the respondents but this did not change people’s attitudes toward bats and what they used the bats for. Another important finding was that unsustainable harvests of bats for food and other uses was just as much a conservation threat as associating bats with zoonoses. Because of how vulnerable bats are, findings from this study suggest that the Ghana Forestry Commission should strengthen legislation against the hunting of bats, commercialization of bat bushmeat, and destruction of bats’ habitats.",

Here we report on a survey of melanistic individuals of Myotis emarginatus (Geoﬀroy’s bat) in the Northwestern edge of its distribution. Across the sampled region, 31 sites and over 3000 individuals of M. emarginatus were observed. Overall, melanism was found in approximately 2-4% of the populations. To our knowledge this is the highest proportion of melanistic individuals recorded in any bat species thus far. Such large levels of melanism may indicate a recent bottleneck in the population. Further research on the genetic structure and behaviour of this population may help identify the possible causes and consequences of this peculiarity.",

The specimen, caught on 5 August 2012, had been previously (23 September 2010) banded in Italy in the Nature State Reserve of Pian degli Ontani (Cutigliano, Pistoia Province, Italy, 10° 41’ 33” E, 44° 06’ 27” N; ring code WWF-ITALY C0524). The minimum straight distance between the two sites is ca. 960 km. This record is the ﬁrst that proves the existence of migration in Italian populations of N. leisleri and shows that a long NE-SW migration route – one of the longest recorded in Europe by N. leisleri – is followed. The observation remarks once again the importance of a large-scale, transnational planning of bat conservation.",

It is common to link DNA barcoding to phylogenetic reconstruction, and there is indeed an overlap, but identiﬁcation and phylogenetic positioning/classiﬁcation are two diﬀerent processes. In mammals, a better phylogenetic reconstruction, able to dig in ﬁne details the relationships among biological entities, is really welcomed, but do we need DNA barcoding too? In our opinion, the answer is positive, but not only for the identiﬁcation power, nor for the supposed ability of DNA barcoding to discover new species. We do need DNA barcoding because it is a modern tool, able to create an integrated system, in which it is possible to link the many aspects of the biology of living beings starting from their identiﬁcation. With 7000 species estimated and a growing interest in knowledge, exploitation and conservation, mammals are one of the best animal groups to achieve this goal.",

We also identiﬁed species richness within each biotic zone and the distributions of species considered of high conservation priority. We used this information to highlight conservation priorities for bats in southern Africa (deﬁned here as between the latitudes of 8° S, slightly north of Zambia, to the southern tip of Africa 34° S, an area of approximately 9781840 km2). We used maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) to model habitat suitability for 58 bat species in order to determine the key eco-geographical variables inﬂuencing their distributions. The potential distribution of each bat species was aﬀected by diﬀerent ecogeographic variables but in general, water availability (both temporary and permanent), seasonal precipitation, vegetation, and karst (caves/limestone) areas were the most important factors. The highest levels of species richness were found mainly in the eastern dry savanna area and some areas of wet savanna. Of the species considered to be of high priority due to a combination of restricted distributions or niches and/or endemism (7 fruit bats, 23 cave-dwellers, 18 endemic and near-endemic, 14 niche-restricted and 15 range-restricted), nine species were considered to be at most risk. We found that range-restricted species were commonly found in areas with low species richness; therefore, conservation decisions need to take into account not only species richness but also species considered to be particularly vulnerable across the biogeographical area of interest.",

We explored the morphofunctional variation of the skull in molossids from Argentina, where 18 species occur, and are representative of the vast South American Southern Cone region. We measured 18 craniodental variables in 377 specimens representing all 18 species. We performed a multivariate analysis using craniodental variables, with and without correcting for body mass variation, and applied a comparative phylogenetic method to determine the importance of phylogeny in morphofunctional variation. The specimens distribution in morphospace showed a clear segregation between species on the basis of skull size and morphological diﬀerences that related with prey selection, and associated with other important factors such as echolocation and ﬂight. Our results highlighted that the morphological pattern observed was determined principally by the evolutionary history of the family, as we identiﬁed major events of expansion of occupied morphospace with the origination of large species such as those in Eumops as well as small species of Molossops and Cynomops. Our ﬁndings suggest that the joint eﬀects of history, size and functional morphology boosted the evolution of Neotropical molossids and facilitated the coexistence of related species.",

            "abstractNote": "All mammalian hibernators arouse periodically throughout the winter and weather change conditions is one of the major drivers aﬀecting their behaviour, phenology and distribution patterns worldwide, with potentially severe implications for biodiversity conservation. Although the relationships between bat distribution and prevailing environmental conditions are relatively well-known, the behaviour adaptation responses to scenarios of weather change conditions are still largely unknown. Temperate insectivorous bats show diﬀerent ecological requirements for winter activity and bouts frequency depending on the species and weather prevailing condition. The European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis) is a non-strictly hibernating bat species, characterized by short periods of torpor in contrast with other species from the Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae families, which are strictly hibernating bat species. This study was carried out in a Mediterranean region providing unique information on daily winter bat activity patterns with relevance for the understanding how instantaneous and cumulative weather conditions inﬂuenced non-strictly and strictly hibernating bat species winter activity patterns to anticipate ecological consequences under future climate change scenarios. Our results clearly demonstrate that instantaneous and cumulative weather conditions induce diﬀerent behavioural responses on non-strictly and strictly hibernating bat species concerning winter activity, highlighting the importance of cumulative weather conditions for strictly hibernating bat species. Therefore, the understanding of the role of behavioural plasticity among bat communities to cope with changing weather conditions is critical, particularly for the activity patterns of the strictly hibernating bat species during hibernation. This is fundamental to anticipate the potential ecological consequences and the main challenges and priorities for bat conservation.",

Prior to this study, its breeding biology was unknown and the population status in Indonesia was not well understood. Its breeding habitat, prey, behaviour, voice, eggs and the development of the young are described here for the first time. Breeding biology was studied in 1989 at a nest in south Sumatra, Indonesia. The nest was in the transition zone between mangrove and freshwater swamp forest. Incubation took less than 29 days, and two eggs hatched. Fish 2–7 cm long comprised 67% of the prey for feeding young. The chick was fully feathered at 52–57 days and was seen flying when 57–62 days old. The species is rare in south Sumatra. It occurs in low numbers and flocks of up to seven birds were observed. The density is estimated at 20–40 birds within 110,000 ha of primary swamp forest. At this density, the population would be below 100 birds in south Sumatra and between 100 and 300 in Indonesia. The species is threatened by development and conversion of primary swamp forest.",

When it comes to small animals such as smaller birds, mammals, or even insects, the current approach is to use extremely lightweight RF tags to be located using radio telemetry. A new quantum leap in technology is needed to overcome these limitations and to enable new ways for observations of larger numbers of small animals. In an interdisciplinary team, we are working on the different aspects of such a new technology. In particular, we report on our ﬁndings on a sensor network based tracking solution for bats. Our system is based on integrated localization and wireless communication protocols for ultra-low power systems. This requires coding techniques for improved reliability as well as ranging solutions for tracking hunting bats. We address the technological and methodical problems related to system design, software support, and protocol design. First ﬁeld experiments have been conducted that showcase the capabilities of our system.",

Despite the high number of parks in Brazilian cities, they did not yet raise the interest of most zoologists, except for some surveys of birds and butterflies. The objectives of the present study were: (i) to inventory the bat species of Quinta da Boa Vista (QBV), a large (25 ha) urban park centrally located in densely populated Rio de Janeiro, which is Brazil’s second largest metropolis; (ii) to compare the species richness observed in roosts with the richness recorded through mist netting in flight routes and near fruiting fig trees; and (iii) to analyze recaptures of bats marked in this park and recaptured in other sites and vice-versa. Sampling totaled 104 sampling nights resulting in 3,256 captures (including 133 recaptures) between April 1989 and December 2004. We also sampled roosts and received some specimens from park visitors and city workers. We documented 21 bat species, predominantly large frugivores. The number of expected species for this park was 24.0 ± 4.6, and the total sampled represented 87.5% of the expected. The recapture of bats marked in surrounding forest fragments and in QBV shows the importance of urban parks for the maintenance of bat diversity. Inspection of roosts produced two species that had not been captured with other methods. Sampling near fruiting fig trees did not differ in terms of richness from sampling carried out far from these trees or during their non-fruiting periods.",

In general, bats react to the increase of nocturnal illumination by reducing the use of open spaces, by limiting foraging activity or by shortening the activity periods. To determine the influence of moon cycle on the efficiency of bat netting, captures of 28 night-samplings were analyzed in southeastern Brazil. The capture rate and species richness were inversely related to the moonlight intensity. Among the most frequently netted species, only two showed significant and negative relation with increasing moonlight. The highest variation in species richness was observed in gleaners and nectarivorous species. The days following new moon were the most productive in terms of capture rate and species richness. The local species richness was not archived when sampling was restricted to any single period of the moon cycle. Bat community studies may benefit from samplings spanning the entire moon cycle.",

The most abundant bats were the phyllostomids Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823), Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1776) and Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758) and the most abundant flies were the streblids Trichobius longipes (Rudow, 1871), T. joblingi Wenzel, 1966 and Megistopoda aranea (Coquillett, 1899). Phyllostomus hastatus (Pallas, 1767) was the bat species that presented the highest infestation rate. Platyrrhinus lineatus (É. Geoffroy, 1810) and Desmodus rotundus (É. Geoffroy, 1810) were not infested. Besides that, the frequency of bats that were infested by a single species of fly was higher than the frequency of bats infested for two or more, and it may be a pattern.",
