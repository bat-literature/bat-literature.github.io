            "abstractNote": "Rotaviruses (RVs) are classified into eight species/groups (RVA–RVH) according to the migration patterns of their 11 genome segments, as well as by serological and molecular properties of Viral Protein 6 (VP6). In 1997 a new unclassified RV was reported infecting adults in Bangladesh and China. This virus was initially named novel adult diarrhoea rotavirus (ADRV-N), but later renamed as RVH. Since then, RVH has been detected in humans only very sporadically. However, RVH is increasingly being detected in pig populations in the USA, Brazil and Japan, but not yet in Africa. Unfortunately, whole genome sequence data of porcine RVH strains in GenBank is currently restricted to a single strain (SKA-1) from Japan. Porcine diarrhoeic samples were collected in South Africa and analysed for rotavirus using an RVA ELISA and electropherotyping by PAGE. One sample displayed a 4:2:1:1:1:1:1 migration pattern, typical for RVH. In order to further investigate this strain, sequence-independent amplification followed by random sequencing using the 454/Roche GS FLX Sequencer was performed, resulting in the second complete porcine RVH strain (MRC-DPRU1575) available in databases. Phylogenetically, all segments of MRC-DPRU1575 clustered closely with the SKA-1 strain and in some segments with known porcine RVH strains from Brazil and the USA. In contrast, the porcine RVH strains were only distantly related to human RVH strains from Asia and a partial RVH-like strain recently detected in bats from Cameroon. Overall, strain MRC-DPRU1575 is the first complete genome of a porcine RVH from Africa and allows for the development of improved RVH screening methods. Our analyses indicate that RVH strains cluster according to their host species, not suggesting any evidence of recent interspecies transmission events. However, more RVH genomes from a wider host range are needed to better understand their evolutionary pathways and zoonotic potential.",

Bats can be asymptomatically infected with rabies, as well as several arboviruses; the possibility that they can act as host for RVFV therefore exists. To examine this possibility, 350 different samples (brain, liver, salivary glands and brown fat) obtained from 150 bats (comprising seven species) were tested for RVFV antigen using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). None of the samples tested positive, but the ELISA proved to have limited sensitivity (> or = 10(3) TCID50/ml). In order to determine whether bats could be infected with RVFV, one Miniopterus schreibersii and two Eptesicus capensis bats were inoculated by the oral or intramuscular route with 100 ml and 30 ml, respectively, of a RVFV suspension with a titre of 10(6) TCID50/ml. None of the bats developed any clinical signs. A low concentration of RVFV antigen was found in the liver and urine of M. schreibersii, but not in brain tissue. A third E. capensis bat was inoculated by the intramuscular route and sacrificed on day 18. A low level of antigen was detected in the brown fat. These results demonstrate that bats can be infected with RVFV, and that further studies should be done to determine the potential of different bat species to act as reservoir hosts for RVFV during inter-epizootic periods.",

            "abstractNote": "Many pathogens of public health and conservation concern persist in host communities. Identifying candidate maintenance and reservoir species is therefore a central component of disease management. The term maintenance species implies that if all species but the putative maintenance species were removed, then the pathogen would still persist. In the absence of field manipulations, this statement inherently requires a causal or mechanistic model to assess. However, we lack a systematic understanding of (i) how often conclusions are made about maintenance and reservoir species without reference to mechanistic models (ii) what types of biases may be associated with these conclusions and (iii) how explicitly invoking causal or mechanistic modelling can help ameliorate these biases. Filling these knowledge gaps is critical for robust inference about pathogen persistence and spillover in multihost–parasite systems, with clear implications for human and wildlife health. To address these gaps, we performed a literature review on the evidence previous studies have used to make claims regarding maintenance or reservoir species. We then developed multihost–parasite models to explore and demonstrate common biases that could arise when inferring maintenance potential from observational prevalence data. Finally, we developed new theory to show how model-driven inference of maintenance species can minimize and eliminate emergent biases. In our review, we found that 83% of studies used some form of observational prevalence data to draw conclusions on maintenance potential and only 6% of these studies combined observational data with mechanistic modelling. Using our model, we demonstrate how the community, spatial and temporal context of observational data can lead to substantial biases in inferences of maintenance potential. Importantly, our theory identifies that model-driven inference of maintenance species elucidates other streams of observational data that can be leveraged to correct these biases. Model-driven inference is an essential, yet underused, component of multidisciplinary studies that make inference about host reservoir and maintenance species. Better integration of wildlife disease surveillance and mechanistic models is necessary to improve the robustness and reproducibility of our conclusions regarding maintenance and reservoir species.",

            "abstractNote": "Health, although universally valued, does not have a universally shared definition. How we define a management goal, in this case health, sets the boundaries of our actions to meet that goal. Without a shared understanding of how to recognize health, it can be extremely hard to inspire cooperative action toward a shared health goal. This chapter explores three prevailing ways wildlife health has and can be defined: (1) as the absence of disease; (2) as capacity derived from interacting individual, environmental, and social factors that allows the individual or population to cope with all demands of daily life; or (3) as a social construct where individuals or population meet our social and scientific expectations for how they exist and persist in an environment. Concepts of population health can overlap with ideas of robustness and resilience. The clarity we provide for our population health goals will influence how society thinks about and acts on keeping wildlife healthy in a rapidly changing world.",

The voom method estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a precision weight for each observation and enters these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods. Two case studies illustrate the use of linear modeling and gene set testing methods.",

After the first outbreak, we created an Animal Mortality Monitoring Network in collaboration with the Gabonese and Congolese Ministries of Forestry and Environment and wildlife organizations (Wildlife Conservation Society and Programme de Conservation et Utilisation Rationnelle des Ecosystemes Forestiers en Afrique Centrale) to predict and possibly prevent human Ebola outbreaks. Since August 2001, 98 wild animal carcasses have been recovered by the network, including 65 great apes. Analysis of 21 carcasses found that 10 gorillas, 3 chimpanzees, and 1 duiker tested positive for Ebola virus. Wild animal outbreaks began before each of the 5 human Ebola outbreaks. Twice we alerted the health authorities to an imminent risk for human outbreaks, weeks before they occurred.",

We demonstrate here that both antigens are exclusively produced under situations of low bioavailability of free Zn2+. Addition of micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ to the culture medium strongly stimulated Aspergillus growth but totally inhibited ASPND1 or ASPF2 production. This effect was specific, since other divalent metals had no effect. Removal of endogenous Zn2+ by a chelator also stimulated ASPND1 production, and the effect was specifically reversed by Zn2+. These results suggest a possible role of these antigens in the survival of the fungus in the lungs.",

Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 308: E380–E392, 2015. First published December 17, 2014; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00277.2014.—We applied digital gene ex-pression profiling to determine the transcriptome of brown and white adipose tissues (BAT and WAT, respectively) during cold exposure. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to cold for 2 or 4 days. A notable induction of genes related to glucose uptake, glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway was observed in BAT from cold-exposed animals. In addition, glycerol-3-phosphate dehy-drogenase 1 expression was induced in BAT from cold-challenged mice, suggesting increased synthesis of glycerol from glucose. Sim-ilarly, expression of lactate dehydrogenases was induced by cold in BAT. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (Pdk2) and Pdk4 were ex-pressed at significantly higher levels in BAT than in WAT, and Pdk2 was induced in BAT by cold. Of notice, only a subset of the changes detected in BAT was observed in WAT. Based on changes in gene expression during cold exposure, we propose a model for the inter-mediary glucose metabolism in activated BAT: 1) fluxes through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are induced, the latter providing reducing equivalents for de novo fatty acid synthesis; 2) glycerol synthesis from glucose is increased, facilitating triacylglyc-erol synthesis/fatty acid re-esterification; 3) glycogen turnover and lactate production are increased; and 4) entry of glucose carbon into the tricarboxylic acid cycle is restricted by PDK2 and PDK4. In summary, our results demonstrate extensive and diverse gene expres-sion changes related to glucose handling in activated BAT.",

These functions lead to many agricultural and industrial applications. β-Glucosidases have been classified into glycoside hydrolase (GH) families GH1, GH3, GH5, GH9, and GH30, based on their amino acid sequences, while other β-glucosidases remain to be classified. The GH1, GH5, and GH30 β-glucosidases fall in GH Clan A, which consists of proteins with (β/α)(8)-barrel structures. In contrast, the active site of GH3 enzymes comprises two domains, while GH9 enzymes have (α/α)(6) barrel structures. The mechanism by which GH1 enzymes recognize and hydrolyze substrates with different specificities remains an area of intense study.",

To determine whether T. zimbabwensis affects poikilotherm vertebrates in the wild, monitor lizards (Varanus niloticus) and Nile crocodiles were collected in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In 5 (17.6%) of the 28 monitor lizards from Zimbabwe, T. zimbabwensis larvae were identified. For the wild Nile crocodiles from Mozambique, species-level identification was not possible, yet immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 8 (20%) of the 40 animals harboured non-encapsulated Trichinella sp. larvae, which probably belonged to T. zimbabwensis. This is the first report of T. zimbabwensis in wild reptiles, and the findings are consistent with reports that vertebrates with scavenger and cannibalistic behaviour are the most important hosts of Trichinella spp. The wide distribution of monitor lizards and crocodiles in Africa and the development of national crocodile breeding programs in many African countries should be taken into consideration when evaluating the risk of transmission of this parasite to mammals, including humans.",

In this study .8,500 base pairs of digenomic DNA for 111 taxa were sequenced and analyzed using maximum-parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to construct trees and reexamine hypotheses of supergeneric evolutionary relationships in Vespertilioninae. Results of these analyses validate monophyly of Vespertilioninae with the exclusion of Myotis and support recognition of 6 tribes: Antrozoini, Lasiurini, Scotophilini, Vespertilionini, and 2 new unnamed tribal clades, the perimyotine group and the hypsugine group. Tree topologies indicate a Nycticeiini–Eptesicini group, but this clade is not supported. The heuristically pleasing tribe Plecotini also is unresolved in these analyses. These results provided further support and greater resolution for previously proposed hypotheses of Vespertilioninae evolution based on mitochondrial DNA, and although deep branching patterns are not fully resolved, these data increase our understanding of the evolution of this ecologically important and diverse group of bats. Understanding the evolutionary relationships within the subfamily Vespertilioninae (Mammalia: Chiroptera: Vesperti-lionidae) has been difficult for systematists because of the evolutionary and ecological success (in terms of species richness and biogeography) and constrained circumscription (in terms of morphological diversification) of this subfamily. Approximately 240 species have been described and placed in this subfamily (Simmons 2005). However, few useful synapomorphic morphologic character states exist that unam-biguously define taxa belonging to Vespertilioninae (Hill and",

            "abstractNote": "The last tropical rainforests are important reservoirs for yet unknown pathogens with zoonotic potential. Human intrusion into these former remote habitats through deforestation and bush meat hunting leads to an increased contact between humans and wildlife, and between humans and insect vectors (Leendertz et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2008; Gillespie et al., 2009). In the course of our research on pathogen transmission in this type of ecosystem, samples from non-human primates and other nammalian hosts living in tropical rainforests as well as humans living around rainforests are collected and analysed at the Robert Koch-Institut. One of the aims of our studies is to evaluate the risk of emergence of new zoonoses in the human population. We specifically focus on screening humans with high exposure to blood and organs of wild primates through bushmeat hunting and handling, but pathogen transmission from other possible hosts are also analysed. Chimpanzees can be seen as a \"natural system\" to study disease transmission among primates. In the last years we have shown that simian retroviruses, such as the Simian T-Cell Leukemia Virus-1 (STLV-1) and Foamy-Viruses (SFV) are transmitted from one non-human primate to another. Based on molecular epidemiological findings as well as prevalence data in different age classes of wild chimpanzees, we could show that the main transmission of these viruses is through the hunter-prey relationship that exists between red colobus monkeys and chimpanzees (Leendertz et al., 2004a, b; Leendertz et al., 2008). These findings in wild primates, which are known to be hunted by humans, inspired us to perform a study focused on the human population in the area together with the Institut Pasteur Cote d'Ivoire, and we found evidence of virus transmission from non-human primates to humans. Furthermore, we investigated several outbreaks of respiratory diseases in wild chimpanzees. In necropsy samples from deceased chimpanzees we detected two new strains of S. pneumoniae (Chi et al., 2007). In addition, the chimpanzees were infected with human paramyxoviruses (Kondgen et al., 2008). This was the first description of anthropoozonotic transmission of human respiratory viruses to great apes, identifying that human diseases are an important threat to these endangered species. In order to investigate the influence of ecological changes on the prevalence of mosquitoes and arboviruses, we systematically captured mosquitoes in and around tropical rainforests with different degrees of ecological changes. Firstly, we detected new viruses of the families Flavi-, Bunya- and Coronaviruses (Junglen et al., 2009), Secondly, we could show that ecological changes had a dramatic influence on the distribution and prevalence of mosquito and viruses, indicating that disturbance of the rainforest increases the risk of transmission of arboviruses to the human population (Junglen et al., in print).",

Conversely, Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 and stimulate type 2 immunity, which is characterized by high antibody titers. Type 1 and type 2 immunity are not strictly synonymous with cell-mediated and humoral immunity, because Th1 cells also stimulate moderate levels of antibody production, whereas Th2 cells actively suppress phagocytosis. For most infections, save those caused by large eukaryotic pathogens, type 1 immunity is protective, whereas type 2 responses assist with the resolution of cell-mediated inflammation. Severe systemic stress, immunosuppression, or overwhelming microbial inoculation causes the immune system to mount a type 2 response to an infection normally controlled by type 1 immunity. In such cases, administration of antimicrobial chemotherapy and exogenous cytokines restores systemic balance, which allows successful immune responses to clear the infection.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Each of the pathogenic human retroviruses (HIV-1/2 and HTLV-1) has a nonhuman primate counterpart, and the presence of these retroviruses in humans results from interspecies transmission. The passage of another simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), from apes or monkeys to humans has been reported. Mandrillus sphinx, a monkey species living in central Africa, is naturally infected with SFV. We evaluated the natural history of the virus in a free-ranging colony of mandrills and investigated possible transmission of mandrill SFV to humans. RESULTS: We studied 84 semi-free-ranging captive mandrills at the Primate Centre of the Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville (Gabon) and 15 wild mandrills caught in various areas of the country. The presence of SFV was also evaluated in 20 people who worked closely with mandrills and other nonhuman primates. SFV infection was determined by specific serological (Western blot) and molecular (nested PCR of the integrase region in the polymerase gene) assays. Seropositivity for SFV was found in 70/84 (83%) captive and 9/15 (60%) wild-caught mandrills and in 2/20 (10%) humans. The 425-bp SFV integrase fragment was detected in peripheral blood DNA from 53 captive and 8 wild-caught mandrills and in two personnel. Sequence and phylogenetic studies demonstrated the presence of two distinct strains of mandrill SFV, one clade including SFVs from mandrills living in the northern part of Gabon and the second consisting of SFV from animals living in the south. One man who had been bitten 10 years earlier by a mandrill and another bitten 22 years earlier by a macaque were found to be SFV infected, both at the Primate Centre. The second man had a sequence close to SFVmac sequences. Comparative sequence analysis of the virus from the first man and from the mandrill showed nearly identical sequences, indicating genetic stability of SFV over time. CONCLUSION: Our results show a high prevalence of SFV infection in a semi-free-ranging colony of mandrills, with the presence of two different strains. We also showed transmission of SFV from a mandrill and a macaque to humans.",

            "abstractNote": "By means of an experimental guinea pig model, the immunogenicities of a live spore vaccine, a killed hyphal cell wall vaccine and a soluble cytoplasmic extract vaccine of Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. erinacei were compared, and their modifying influence on the infectivity and duration of experimental dermatophyte lesions examined. Of the three vaccines, the live-spore one was the most effective and closely simulated the type of immunity which develops following a natural infection. Lesions produced in cell wall vaccinated animals revealed significantly less infectivity and were reduced in duration as compared with lesions in unvaccinated animals. The cytoplasmic extract vaccine had no beneficial effect on the course of experimental infection; indeed it seemed to increase the infectivity of lesions. Acquired resistance to reinfection in a pregnant guinea pig was not passed on to the offspring. Significant levels (titer of greater than or equal to 1:16) of antibody were detected in the sera of all infected and vaccinated animals using an indirect fluorescent antibody technique and germling antigens. Using counterimmunoelectrophoresis, precipitating antibodies were detectable in the sera of all seven animals vaccinated with the cell wall or cytoplasmic extract, in one (20%) of the control animals after reinfection, and none of the four animals injected subcutaneously with the live spore vaccine. Thus no correlation between antibody titer and the severity and duration of lesions was observed. These results endorse the growing hypothesis that cell mediated immunity is of prime importance in protection again dermatophyte invasion and suggests that prophylactic vaccination procedures are worthy of further evaluation in lower animals",

            "abstractNote": "We have previously reported that C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with a live, attenuated mutant of Coccidioides posadasii, referred to as the ΔT vaccine, are fully protected against pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. This model was used here to explore the nature of vaccine immunity during the initial 2-week period after intranasal challenge. Elevated neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration into the lungs of nonvaccinated mice contrasted with markedly reduced recruitment of these cells in vaccinated animals. The numbers of lung-infiltrated macrophages and dendritic cells showed a progressive increase in vaccinated mice and corresponded with reduction of the lung infection. Concentrations of selected inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were initially higher in lung homogenates of vaccinated mice but then generally decreased at 14 days postchallenge in correlation with containment of the organism and apparent dampening of the inflammation of host tissue. Profiles of cytokines detected in lung homogenates of ΔT-vaccinated mice were indicative of a mixed T helper 1 (Th1)-, Th2-, and Th17-type immune response, a conclusion which was supported by detection of lung infiltration of activated T cells with the respective CD4(+) gamma interferon (IFN-γ)(+), CD4(+) interleukin-5 (IL-5)(+), and CD4(+) IL-17A(+) phenotypes. While Th1 and Th2 immunity was separately dispensed of by genetic manipulation without loss of ΔT vaccine-mediated protection, loss of functional Th17 cells resulted in increased susceptibility to infection in immunized mice. Characterization of the early events of protective immunity to Coccidioides infection in vaccinated mice contributes to the identification of surrogates of immune defense and provides potential insights into the design of immunotherapeutic protocols for treatment of coccidioidomycosis.",

With time, the functionality of SPAdes was extended to enable assembly of IonTorrent data, as well as hybrid assembly from short and long reads (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore). In this article we present protocols for five different assembly pipelines that comprise the SPAdes package and that are used for assembly of metagenomes and transcriptomes as well as assembly of putative plasmids and biosynthetic gene clusters from whole-genome sequencing and metagenomic datasets. In addition, we present guidelines for understanding results with use cases for each pipeline, and several additional support protocols that help in using SPAdes properly. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: The molecular profile of circulating blood can reflect physiological and pathological events occurring in other tissues and organs of the body and delivers a comprehensive view of the status of the immune system. Blood has been useful in studying the pathobiology of many diseases. It is accessible and easily collected making it ideally suited to the development of diagnostic biomarker tests. The blood transcriptome has a high complement of globin RNA that could potentially saturate next-generation sequencing platforms, masking lower abundance transcripts. Methods to deplete globin mRNA are available, but their effect has not been comprehensively studied in peripheral whole blood RNA-Seq data. In this study we aimed to assess technical variability associated with globin depletion in addition to assessing general technical variability in RNA-Seq from whole blood derived samples.\\n\\nRESULTS: We compared technical and biological replicates having undergone globin depletion or not and found that the experimental globin depletion protocol employed removed approximately 80% of globin transcripts, improved the correlation of technical replicates, allowed for reliable detection of thousands of additional transcripts and generally increased transcript abundance measures. Differential expression analysis revealed thousands of genes significantly up-regulated as a result of globin depletion. In addition, globin depletion resulted in the down-regulation of genes involved in both iron and zinc metal ion bonding.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Globin depletion appears to meaningfully improve the quality of peripheral whole blood RNA-Seq data, and may improve our ability to detect true biological variation. Some concerns remain, however. Key amongst them the significant reduction in RNA yields following globin depletion. More generally, our investigation of technical and biological variation with and without globin depletion finds that high-throughput sequencing by RNA-Seq is highly reproducible within a large dynamic range of detection and provides an accurate estimation of RNA concentration in peripheral whole blood. High-throughput sequencing is thus a promising technology for whole blood transcriptomics and biomarker discovery.",

            "abstractNote": "Inflammatory mediators from peripheral tissues may control dendritic cell (DC) development in the bone marrow. In this study, DCs (CD11c+ cells) differentiated from the bone marrow of mice with inflammation of the airways, or the peritoneal cavity had poor priming ability resulting in reduced, long-lived responses to that antigen in vivo. This indicates enhancement of regulatory mechanisms of immune responses through a peripheral tissue-bone marrow axis. If CD11c+ cells, expanded from the bone marrow of mice with tissue inflammation were antigen pre-loaded and injected into mice already sensitized to that antigen, then subsequent contact hypersensitivity responses were significantly reduced. The effects of inflammation were imprinted in vivo and were independent of in vitro culture conditions for DC differentiation. The effect of tissue inflammation on the bone marrow DC precursors was not detected in mice treated subcutaneously with slow-release indomethacin pellets, suggesting a role for prostanoids, including prostaglandin E2, in differentiation of regulatory CD11c+ cells from bone marrow. Our study represents an important homeostatic process with potential for therapeutic use in the future. © 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology.",

In this article, Clifford Snapper and James Mond suggest that the nature of the B-cell activator, in combination with cytokines produced by antigen non-specific cells, including macrophages, NK cells, and polyclonally activated B cells, may play an important role in the process leading to Ig isotype switching in response to TI antigens.",

            "abstractNote": "The capture of pathogen gene expression signatures directly from the host niche promises to fuel our understanding of the highly complex nature of microbial virulence. However, obtaining and interpreting biological information from infected tissues presents multiple experimental and intellectual challenges, from difficulties in extracting pathogen RNA and appropriate choice of experimental design, to interpretation of the resulting infection transcriptome, itself a product of responses to multiple host-derived cues. The recent publication of several host-infecting fungal transcriptomes offers new opportunities to study the commonalities of animal and plant pathogeneses, which in turn might direct the rational design of new and broader spectrum antifungal agents. Here, we examine the transcriptional basis of modelled Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Ustilago maydis and Magneporthe infections, placing our analysis of the published findings within the context of the various modelling procedures used, and the relevant pathogen lifestyles, to facilitate the first cross-species comparison of fungal transcription during infectious growth. Significant concordance was identified among infecting transcriptomes of the inhaled fungal pathogens C. neoformans and A. fumigatus. The significance of gene clustering and subtelomeric gene repertoires is also discussed.",

However, rapidly fatal cryptococcal meningitis in young Africans has been known to exist in central Africa for at least 30 years, mainly in the lower area of the Congo River basin. Cases have been reported in this area since 1953, particularly in young patients during the 1950s. It is also known that central African AIDS patients frequently suffer from cryptococcosis, and there is a possibility that earlier clinical reports of encephalitis were actually fatal cases of AIDS in young Africans. It appears possible that the central part of the African continent is the area where human immunodeficiency virus originated.; PIP: Rapidly fatal cryptococcal meningitis has existed in central Africa for more than 30 years, mainly in the lower area of the Congo River basin. Cases have been reported in that area since 1953, especially among young patients during the 1950s. People with AIDS in central Africa also often have cryptococcosis, and it is possible that earlier clinical reports of encephalitis were actually fatal cases of AIDS in young Africans. Before the advent of AIDS in Europe, fatal cases of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans resembling acute meningitis were rare and nonexistent in young adults. The available evidence suggests that HIV may have originated in central Africa, where it had long remained in a specific, but unknown and overlooked habitat. Cryptococcosis infection, cryptococcosis in the Congo River basin, the historical presence of HIV, and HIV in Haiti and among Haitians are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "After being positively selected on CD1d-expressing thymocytes, NKT cells undergo a series of developmental changes that can take place inside or outside the thymus. We asked whether CD1d continues to play a role in late-stage NKT cell development and, in particular, during the functionally significant acquisition of NK1.1 that is indicative of NKT cell maturity. We report that CD1d is indeed crucial for this step, because immature NK1.1- NKT cells fail to fully mature when transferred to a CD1d-deficient environment. Surprisingly, however, the lack of CD1d did not greatly affect the long-term survival of NKT cells, and they continued to express CD69 and slowly proliferate. This directly contradicts the currently held view that these phenomena are caused by autoreactivity directed against CD1d/TCR-restricted self-Ags. Our findings demonstrate an ongoing role for TCR-mediated signaling throughout NKT cell development, but the characteristic semiactivated basal state of NKT cells is controlled by Cold-independent factors or is intrinsic to the cells themselves.

However, in comparison to human (HEF) and mouse (MEF) fibroblasts (homoiotherms) induced with NDV-R or poly I.poly C, interferon production in fibroblasts of spotted sousliks (SL) (heterotherm) and in the aneuploid line of mouse origin (L929) exhibits a greater cold resistance. In contrast to HEF and MEF cells in SL and L929 cells interferon was produced even at 21 degrees C after induction with NDV-R and at 26 degrees C after induction with poly I.poly C. A comparison of alpha and gamma interferon production by mouse and spotted souslik leukocytes did not reveal such distinct differences. At a low temperature (26 degrees C) the production of NDV-R induced interferon was depressed, but it was higher after induction with LPS in both types of leukocytes. PHA and Con A induced interferon was produced in both types of leukocytes only at 37 degrees C. These data confirm that alpha, beta and gamma interferon induction is triggered by different mechanisms and suggest a resistance to cold of beta interferon production in heterothermic animals.",

Substantial data support the role of these proteins in innate and adaptive immunity. Of these family members, IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17E have been the best studied. Both IL-17A and IL-17F contribute to the host response to extracellular bacteria and fungi, and IL-17E has been shown to play a role in parasitic infections. In addition, numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies link these proteins to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, and a number of therapeutic programmes targeting these family members are in clinical development. This review will highlight the cellular sources, receptors/target cells, and role in inflammation of these and the less-characterized family members, IL-17B, IL-17C and IL-17D.",

HIV-1 M is subdivided into nine subtypes and a wide diversity of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms. The heterogenic HIV-1 M subtype/CRF distribution is the result of founder effects. The genetic diversity of HIV-1 continues to increase overtime due to demographic factors such as travel and migration and frequent co/superinfections. In addition, the expanded access to antiretrovirals leads to an increasing number of drug-resistant strains, especially in resource limited countries.",

            "abstractNote": "When the research on the ecology of monkeypox virus entered the latest stage in 1984, three groups of animals were considered priority candidates for maintenance of virus circulations in nature because of their relatively higher population density: terrestrial rodents, squirrels, and gregarious bats. Following the isolation of the virus from a wild squirrel in 1985 another survey was carried out in Bumba zone of Zaire in January-February 1986, which included collection of animal samples, later on tested by WHO collaborating laboratories. No antibodies were found in 233 rodents tested. A high prevalence of monkeypox-specific antibodies (24.7%) found in 320 squirrels of Funisciurus anerythrus species suggested that these animals sustain virus transmission in the areas surrounding human settlements. A consistently high level of antibody prevalence found among squirrels Heliosciurus rufobrachium suggested that this species is also steadily involved in the transmission. The squirrels, the only mammals frequently infected by monkeypox in the areas of human activities, which are frequently trapped by the population, are obviously a major source of infection for human beings. Out of 39 primates collected during the survey from the primary forest, three were found seropositive for monkeypox. At the moment, however, it is difficult to say whether the primates play an important role in sustaining virus transmission in nature, or (like human beings) that they are an occasional host of the virus. Possibilities are discussed of monkeypox virus transmission being sustained by squirrels outside the areas of major human activities.",

In this review, we discuss relationships between nuclear organization and transcription in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of genes in the interphase cancer nucleus and the regulatory functions of nuclear matrix proteins. We also analyse the role of nuclear topology in the generation of gene fusions. We speculate that this type of multi-layered analysis will one day provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of cancer and the identification of new therapeutic targets.",

            "abstractNote": "Evolutionary rescue occurs when a population genetically adapts to a new stressful environment that would otherwise cause its extinction. Forecasting the probability of persistence under stress, including emergence of drug resistance as a special case of interest, requires experimentally validated quantitative predictions. Here, we propose general analytical predictions, based on diffusion approximations, for the probability of evolutionary rescue. We assume a narrow genetic basis for adaptation to stress, as is often the case for drug resistance. First, we extend the rescue model of Orr & Unckless (Am. Nat. 2008 172, 160-169) to a broader demographic and genetic context, allowing the model to apply to empirical systems with variation among mutation effects on demography, overlapping generations and bottlenecks, all common features of microbial populations. Second, we confront our predictions of rescue probability with two datasets from experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (bacterium). The tests show the qualitative agreement between the model and observed patterns, and illustrate how biologically relevant quantities, such as the per capita rate of rescue, can be estimated from fits of empirical data. Finally, we use the results of the model to suggest further, more quantitative, tests of evolutionary rescue theory.",

These retroviruses are called simian T-lymphotrophic virus type I (STLV-I). Infection with STLV-I has been associated with lymphoma and leukaemia in macaques, baboons, African green monkeys and gorillas. However, no STLV-I infection has been detected in New World primates, although STLV-II has been detected in spider monkeys. When sera from 10 species of non-human primates maintained at the Institute of Primate Research were screened for STLV-I infection, anti-STLV-I antibodies were detected in 12%, 12%, 23% and 38% of the olive baboons, yellow baboons, African green monkeys and lowland Sykes' monkeys, respectively. Western-blot studies confirmed these results. To date, no clinical disease has been linked with STLV-I infection in these colonies. The relatively high prevalence of anti-STLV-I antibodies in these non-human primates offers an opportunity for studies on the transmission, phylogenetic relationships and natural history of STLV-I in primate colonies.",

            "abstractNote": "Whilst remarkable progress in elucidating the mechanisms governing interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIVs) has been made, similar studies focusing on low-pathogenic AIVs isolated from the wild waterfowl reservoir are limited. We previously reported that two AIV strains (subtypes H6N2 and H3N8) isolated from wild waterfowl in Zambia harbored some amino acid residues preferentially associated with human influenza virus proteins (so-called human signatures) and replicated better in the lungs of infected mice and caused more morbidity than a strain lacking such residues. To further substantiate these observations, we infected chickens and mice intranasally with AIV strains of various subtypes (H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H6N2, H9N1 and H11N9) isolated from wild waterfowl in Zambia. Although some strains induced seroconversion, all of the tested strains replicated poorly and were nonpathogenic for chickens. In contrast, most of the strains having human signatures replicated well in the lungs of mice, and one of these strains caused severe illness in mice and induced lung injury that was characterized by a severe accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These results suggest that some strains tested in this study may have the potential to infect mammalian hosts directly without adaptation, which might possibly be associated with the possession of human signature residues. Close monitoring and evaluation of host-associated signatures may help to elucidate the prevalence and emergence of AIVs with potential for causing zoonotic infections.",

In our study we directly tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of in vivo administered anti-IFN-gamma mAb on rejection of MHC class II disparate skin allografts, and comparing its effect on rejection of MHC class I disparate skin allografts placed on the same individual mice. We found that anti-IFN-gamma mAb blocked the rejection of MHC class II disparate skin allografts, but had no effect on the rejection of MHC class I disparate skin allografts. These results demonstrate that endogenously produced IFN-gamma is critical for rejection of MHC class II disparate skin allografts, but not for rejection of MHC class I disparate skin allografts. Thus, this study strongly supports the concept that MHC class II rejection responses require IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expression on keratinocytes of the allograft.",

From humans, both Strongyloides fuelleborni and Strongyloides stercoralis were recorded, though the former was predominant. Only S. fuelleborni was present in the great apes in both areas. Phylogenetic analysis of partial mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (Cox1) and comparison of 18S rDNA hyper variable region IV (HVR-IV) sequences implied that in DSPA S. fuelleborni populations in humans differ from those in the nonhuman great apes.",

We have previously characterized aspects of the intracellular trafficking of membrane-bound TNFalpha and its delivery to the cell surface at the site of phagocytic cups for secretion (Murray, R.Z., J.G. Kay, D.G. Sangermani, and J.L. Stow. 2005. Science. 310:1492-1495). The trafficking pathway and surface delivery of IL-6, a soluble cytokine, were studied here using approaches such as live cell imaging of fluorescently tagged IL-6 and immunoelectron microscopy. Newly synthesized IL-6 accumulates in the Golgi complex and exits in tubulovesicular carriers either as the sole labeled cargo or together with TNFalpha, utilizing specific soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins to fuse with the recycling endosome. Within recycling endosomes, we demonstrate the compartmentalization of cargo proteins, wherein IL-6 is dynamically segregated from TNFalpha and from surface recycling transferrin. Thereafter, these cytokines are independently secreted, with TNFalpha delivered to phagocytic cups but not IL-6. Therefore, the recycling endosome has a central role in orchestrating the differential secretion of cytokines during inflammation.",

            "abstractNote": "The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans causes lethal systemic infections because of its ability to grow and disseminate in a host. The C. albicans plasma membrane is essential for virulence by acting as a protective barrier and through its key roles in interfacing with the environment, secretion of virulence factors, morphogenesis, and cell wall synthesis. Difficulties in studying hydrophobic membranes have limited the understanding of how plasma membrane organization contributes to its function and to the actions of antifungal drugs. Therefore, the role of the recently discovered plasma membrane subdomains termed the membrane compartment containing Can1 (MCC) was analyzed by assessing the virulence of a sur7Δ mutant. Sur7 is an integral membrane protein component of the MCC that is needed for proper localization of actin, morphogenesis, cell wall synthesis, and responding to cell wall stress. MCC domains are stable 300-nm-sized punctate patches that associate with a complex of cytoplasmic proteins known as an eisosome. Analysis of virulence-related properties of a sur7Δ mutant revealed defects in intraphagosomal growth in macrophages that correlate with increased sensitivity to oxidation and copper. The sur7Δ mutant was also strongly defective in pathogenesis in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. The mutant cells showed a decreased ability to initiate an infection and greatly diminished invasive growth into kidney tissues. These studies on Sur7 demonstrate that the plasma membrane MCC domains are critical for virulence and represent an important new target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. IMPORTANCECandida albicans, the most common human fungal pathogen, causes lethal systemic infections by growing and disseminating in a host. The plasma membrane plays key roles in enabling C. albicans to grow in vivo, and it is also the target of the most commonly used antifungal drugs. However, plasma membrane organization is poorly understood because of the experimental difficulties in studying hydrophobic components. Interestingly, recent studies have identified a novel type of plasma membrane subdomain in fungi known as the membrane compartment containing Can1 (MCC). Cells lacking the MCC-localized protein Sur7 display broad defects in cellular organization and response to stress in vitro. Consistent with this, C. albicans cells lacking the SUR7 gene were more susceptible to attack by macrophages than cells with the gene and showed greatly reduced virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection. Thus, Sur7 and other MCC components represent novel targets for antifungal therapy.",

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the mouse represent activated Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) myeloid precursor cells. Activation may occur through endogenous or exogenous factors leading to the suppression of immune responses. Under steady state conditions the same precursors differentiate into dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Their linkage to tumor progression and several suppression mechanisms employing the arginine metabolism are well documented, but knowledge of their role in chronic infections, autoimmune diseases and graft-versus-host reactions is just emerging. Several factors have been described to promote MDSC expansion and activation in bone marrow, spleen and tumor sites. New evidence suggests that the Gr-1 antibody itself may differentially trigger myelopoiesis under steady state conditions or induce apoptosis in inflammatory situations after binding to a common epitope expressed on Ly-6C and Ly-6G molecules, respectively. Moreover, two subsets of neutrophil- and monocyte-related MDSC have been described in tumor-bearing and healthy mice. In the present review, we summarize some early work leading to recent findings on these two MDSC subsets, the factors supporting MDSC expansion and activation, as well as novel insights on Gr-1 antibody functions.",

Here we found that mice devoid of T cells and B cells demonstrated substantial contact hypersensitivity responses to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene and oxazolone. Those responses were adaptive in nature, as they persisted for at least 4 weeks and were elicited only by haptens to which mice were previously sensitized. No contact hypersensitivity was induced in mice lacking all lymphocytes, including natural killer cells. Contact hypersensitivity responses were acquired by such mice after adoptive transfer of natural killer cells from sensitized donors. Transferable hapten-specific memory resided in a Ly49C-I(+) natural killer subpopulation localized specifically in donor livers. These observations indicate that natural killer cells can mediate long-lived, antigen-specific adaptive recall responses independent of B cells and T cells.",

            "abstractNote": "Hibernation permits endotherms to survive prolonged periods of cold temperatures and reduced food supply through a combination of energy storage, microhabitat selection, and metabolic reduction. For many mammals, predictable thermal relationships define both the length of the hibernation period and the level of energy expenditure during hibernation, facilitating the ability to make precise predictions about the energetic consequences of microhabitat and latitudinal temperature gradients. Here we develop a quantitative model predicting the effect of ambient temperature on the hibernation energetics of little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) and compare predictions of the model with the observed distribution of bats across thermal gradients within caves and across the North American continent. Our model predicts pronounced effects of ambient temperature on total winter energy requirements and a relatively narrow combination of hibernaculum temperatures and lengths of winter that permit successful hibernation. Empirical distributional patterns of M. lucifugus correspond closely to these predictions, suggesting that temperature effects on hibernation energetics severely constrain the distribution of bats within hibernacula at the northern limit of their range",

            "abstractNote": "A variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics. © 2008 Refaeli et al.",

Cells stimulated with TGF-beta plus IL-6 were present in the spleen as well as the central nervous system, but they failed to upregulate the proinflammatory chemokines crucial for central nervous system inflammation. In addition, these cells produced IL-10, which has potent anti-inflammatory activities. In contrast, stimulation with IL-23 promoted expression of IL-17 and proinflammatory chemokines but not IL-10. Hence, TGF-beta and IL-6 'drive' initial lineage commitment but also 'restrain' the pathogenic potential of T(H)-17 cells. Our findings suggest that full acquisition of pathogenic function by effector T(H)-17 cells is mediated by IL-23 rather than by TGF-beta and IL-6.",

            "abstractNote": "Bushmeat is a term that refers to the use of wild animals, ranging from cane rats to gorillas, for food. The term typically refers to the practice in forests of Africa. The bushmeat trade is an example of an anthropogenic factor that provides opportunities for the transmission of diseases from wildlife to humans. The expansion of the bushmeat trade over the past 2 decades has provided a venue for the emergence of zoonotic diseases by providing an increased opportunity for the transmission of organisms known to cause disease and organisms with an unknown impact on humans. Because the bushmeat trade is embedded in a complex cultural, political, and economic context, efforts to prevent the emergence of zoonoses require a multidisciplinary approach.

The viral genome is divided into three segments (L-M-S) of distinct size and functions. The infection is generally mediated by a tick vector, in particular belonging to the Hyalomma genus, and the transmission follows a tick-vertebrate-tick ecologic cycle, with asymptomatic infected animals functioning as reservoirs and amplifiers for CCHFV. Human hosts could be infected primarily through infected ticks or by contact with infected hosts or their body fluids and tissues, also in a nosocomial way and in occupational contexts. Infected symptomatic patients generally manifest a nonspecific illness, which progresses across four stages, with possibly lethal outcomes. Disease outbreaks show a widespread geographic diffusion and a highly variable mortality rate, dramatically peaking in untreated patients. The lack of an adequate animal model and the elevated virus biological risk (only manageable under biosafety level 4 conditions) represent strongly limiting factors for a better characterization of the disease and for the development of specific therapies and vaccines. The present review discusses updated information on CCHFV-related disease, including details about the virus (taxonomy, structure, life cycle, transmission modalities) and considering CCHF pathogenesis, epidemiology and current strategies (diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive).",

            "abstractNote": "Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpz) infecting chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in west central Africa are the closest relatives to all major variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ([HIV-1]; groups M, N and O), and have thus been implicated as the source of the human infections; however, information concerning the prevalence, geographic distribution, and subspecies association of SIVcpz still remains limited. In this study, we tested 71 wild-caught chimpanzees from Cameroon for evidence of SIVcpz infection. Thirty-nine of these were of the central subspecies (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), and 32 were of the Nigerian subspecies (Pan troglodytes vellerosus), as determined by mitochondrial DNA analysis. Serological analysis determined that one P. t. troglodytes ape (CAM13) harbored serum antibodies that cross-reacted strongly with HIV-1 antigens; all other apes were seronegative. To characterize the newly identified virus, 14 partially overlapping viral fragments were amplified from fecal virion RNA and concatenated to yield a complete SIVcpz genome (9,284 bp). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that SIVcpzCAM13 fell well within the radiation of the SIVcpzPtt group of viruses, as part of a clade including all other SIVcpzPtt strains as well as HIV-1 groups M and N. However, SIVcpzCAM13 clustered most closely with SIVcpzGAB1 from Gabon rather than with SIVcpzCAM3 and SIVcpzCAM5 from Cameroon, indicating the existence of divergent SIVcpzPtt lineages within the same geographic region. These data, together with evidence of recombination among ancestral SIVcpzPtt lineages, indicate long-standing endemic infection of central chimpanzees and reaffirm a west central African origin of HIV-1. Whether P. t. vellerosus apes are naturally infected with SIVcpz requires further study.",

            "abstractNote": "Cross-species transmission of retroviruses is common in Cameroon. To determine risk for simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) transmission from nonhuman primates to hunters, we examined 170 hunter-collected dried blood spots (DBS) from 12 species for STLV. PCR with generic tax and group-specific long terminal repeat primers showed that 12 (7%) specimens from 4 nonhuman primate species were infected with STLV. Phylogenetic analyses showed broad diversity of STLV, including novel STLV-1 and STLV-3 sequences and a highly divergent STLV-3 subtype found in Cercopithecus mona and C. nictitans monkeys. Screening of peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA from 63 HTLV-seroreactive, PCR-negative hunters did not identify human infections with this divergent STLV-3. Therefore, hunter-collected DBS can effectively capture STLV diversity at the point where pathogen spillover occurs. Broad screening using this relatively easy collection strategy has potential for large-scale monitoring of retrovirus cross-species transmission among highly exposed human populations.",

Farnesylation allows substrates to interact with membranes and protein targets. Using gene-targeted mice, we report that FTase is essential for embryonic development, but dispensable for adult homeostasis. Six-month-old FTase-deficient mice display delayed wound healing and maturation defects in erythroid cells. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking FTase have a flat morphology and reduced motility and proliferation rates. Ablation of FTase in two ras oncogene-dependent tumor models has no significant consequences for tumor initiation. However, elimination of FTase during tumor progression had a limited but significant inhibitory effect. These results should help to better understand the role of protein farnesylation in normal tissues and in tumor development. Copyright ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.",

Although farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are in clinical trials, their mechanism of action and the role of protein farnesylation in normal physiology are ill understood. In this issue of Cancer Cell, two articles shed light on these important issues. Protein farnesylation was found to be essential for early embryogenesis, dispensable for adult homeostasis, and critical for progression but not initiation of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, Rab geranylgeranyltransferase was identified as a target for some FTIs. This minireview discusses the implications of these findings on normal physiology, malignant transformation, and cancer therapy. Copyright © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",

They compared prolactin levels in fathers before and after infant birth as well as between fathers and nonfathers. C. cupreus fathers carry infants almost exclusively, have higher prolactin levels than nonfathers, but show no prolactin increase after infant birth. C. goeldii fathers carry infants only after 3 weeks, show an increase in prolactin levels during the precarrying period, but do not have higher levels than nonfathers. C. jacchus fathers are the primary carriers, have higher prolactin levels than nonfathers, and show a trend for a prolactin increase after the birth of infants. In conclusion, species differences in the patterns of prolactin secretion were evident and reflect the different paternal roles.",

This is one unanswered question facing the rapidly growing number of researchers studying non-model species. Using Homo sapiens data and resources, we compared the direct mapping of sequencing reads to predicted genes from the genome with mapping to de novo transcriptomes assembled from RNA-Seq data. Gene coverage and expression analysis was further investigated in the non-model context by using increasingly divergent genomic reference species to group assembled contigs by unique genes.\\n\\nRESULTS: Eight transcriptome sets, composed of varying amounts of Illumina and 454 data, were assembled and assessed. Hybrid 454/Illumina assemblies had the highest transcriptome and individual gene coverage. Quantitative whole gene expression levels were highly similar between using a de novo hybrid assembly and the predicted genes as a scaffold, although mapping to the de novo transcriptome assembly provided data on fewer genes. Using non-target species as reference scaffolds does result in some loss of sequence and expression data, and bias and error increase with evolutionary distance. However, within a 100 million year window these effect sizes are relatively small.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Predicted gene sets from sequenced genomes of related species can provide a powerful method for grouping RNA-Seq reads and annotating contigs. Gene expression results can be produced that are similar to results obtained using gene models derived from a high quality genome, though biased towards conserved genes. Our results demonstrate the power and limitations of conducting RNA-Seq in non-model species.",

            "abstractNote": "Mature T and B lymphocytes respond to receptor-delivered signals received during and following activation. These signals regulate the rates of cell death, growth, differentiation and migration that ultimately establish the behaviour patterns collectively referred to as immune regulation. We have been pursuing the philosophy that in vitro systems of lymphocyte stimulation, when analysed quantitatively, help reveal the logical attributes of lymphocyte behaviour. The development of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to track division has enabled the variable of division number to be incorporated into these quantitative analyses. Our studies with CFSE have established a fundamental link between differentiation and division number. Isotype switching, expression of T cell cytokines, surface receptor alterations and changes to intracellular signalling components all display independent patterns of change with division number. The stochastic aspects of these changes and the ability of external signals to independently regulate them argue for a probabilistic modelling framework for describing and understanding immune regulation.",

The complementary DNAs (cDNAs) produced by reverse transcription (RT) of RNA were quantified by real-time PCR against the plasmid DNA standards (6-8 log range) with detection of as few as 10-50 copies of amplicon cDNA per reaction. Analysis of unstimulated and concanavalin A-stimulated woodchuck PBMC demonstrated increased CD and cytokine mRNA expression following mitogenic activation. A liver sample from a woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infected woodchuck with histologically confirmed acute hepatitis had increased intrahepatic CD and cytokine mRNAs compared to liver from an uninfected control woodchuck. The real-time PCR assays were highly specific for the woodchuck markers in PBMC and liver samples and were equally applicable for use in alternate real-time PCR instrumentation. These assays will enable the high-throughput analyses of mRNA markers during WHV infection, and thereby facilitate continued modelling of the immunopathogenesis and immunotherapy of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

            "abstractNote": "In many parts of the world, human-mediated environmental change is depleting biodiversity faster than it can be characterized, while invasive species cause agricultural damage, threaten human health and disrupt native habitats. Consequently, the application of effective approaches for rapid surveillance and identification of biological specimens is increasingly important to inform conservation and biosurveillance efforts. Taxonomic assignments have been greatly advanced using sequence-based applications, such as DNA barcoding, a diagnostic technique that utilizes PCR and DNA sequence analysis of standardized genetic regions. However, in many biodiversity hotspots, endeavors are often hindered by a lack of laboratory infrastructure, funding for biodiversity research and restrictions on the transport of biological samples. A promising development is the advent of low-cost, miniaturized scientific equipment. Such tools can be assembled into functional laboratories to carry out genetic analyses in situ, at local institutions, field stations or classrooms. Here, we outline the steps required to perform amplicon sequencing applications, from DNA isolation to nanopore sequencing and downstream data analysis, all of which can be conducted outside of a conventional laboratory environment using miniaturized scientific equipment, without reliance on Internet connectivity. Depending on sample type, the protocol (from DNA extraction to full bioinformatic analyses) can be completed within 10 h, and with appropriate quality controls can be used for diagnostic identification of samples independent of core genomic facilities that are required for alternative methods. This protocol provides steps for DNA amplicon sequencing using miniaturized laboratory equipment for rapid in situ identification of biological specimens in environments such as local institutions, field stations and classrooms.",

The crosstalk between epithelial cells and leukocytes is essential for orchestrating proper immune responses during host defense. Interleukin (IL)-17 family cytokines are important players in regulating innate epithelial immune responses. Although IL-17A and IL-17F promote antibacterial and antifungal responses, IL-17E is essential for defense against parasitic infections. Emerging data indicate that another member of this family, IL-17C, specifically regulates epithelial immunity. IL-17C production serves as an immediate defense mechanism by epithelial cells, utilizing an autocrine mechanism to promote antibacterial responses at barrier surfaces. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

            "abstractNote": "Genetic variation is of key importance for a species' evolutionary potential, and its estimation is a major component of conservation studies. New DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the analysis of large portions of the genome in nonmodel species, promising highly accurate estimates of such population genetic parameters. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) is used to analyse thousands of variants in the bumble bee species Bombus impatiens, which is common, and Bombus pensylvanicus, which is in decline. Previous microsatellite-based analyses have shown that gene diversity is lower in the declining B. pensylvanicus than in B. impatiens. RADseq nucleotide diversities appear much more similar in the two species. Both species exhibit allele frequencies consistent with historical population expansions. Differences in diversity observed at microsatellites thus do not appear to have arisen from long-term differences in population size and are either recent in origin or may result from mutational processes. Additional research is needed to explain these discrepancies and to investigate the best ways to integrate next-generation sequencing data and more traditional molecular markers in studies of genetic diversity.",

The focus of this review article is on the most common emerging and re-emerging bacterial zoonotic diseases. The role of \"One Health\" approach, public health education, and some measures that can be taken to prevent zoonotic bacterial infections are discussed. KEY POINTS: A zoonotic bacterial disease is a disease that can be very commonly transmitted between animals and humans. Global climate changes, overuse of antimicrobials in medicine, more intensified farm settings, and closer interactions with animals facilitate emergence or re-emergence of bacterial zoonotic infections.The global \"One Health\" approach, which requires interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment, will support public health in general.New strategies for continuous dissemination of multidisciplinary research findings related to zoonotic bacterial diseases are hence needed.",

Serologic reactivity suggesting SIV infection was found in 13 of 16 primate species, including 4 not previously known to harbor SIV. Overall, 131 sera (16.6%) reacted strongly and an additional 34 (4.3%) reacted weakly with HIV antigens. Molecular analysis identified five new phylogenetic SIV lineages. These data document for the first time that a substantial proportion of wild monkeys in Cameroon are SIV infected and that humans who hunt and handle bushmeat are exposed to a plethora of genetically highly divergent viruses.",

The anti-??-glucan antibody showed reactivity to pathogenic fungal Aspergillus and Candida cell wall glucan. Anti-??-glucan antibody could bind whole Candida cells. It also enhanced the candidacidal activity of macrophages in vitro. The anti-??-glucan antibody titer of DBA/2 mice intravenously administered either Candida or Aspergillus solubilized cell wall ??-glucan decreased remarkably dependent on dose. Moreover, in deep mycosis patients, the anti-??-glucan antibody titer decreased, and this change correlated with clinical symptoms and other parameters such as C-reactive protein. It was suggested that the anti-??-glucan antibody formed an antigen-antibody complex and participated in the immune response as a molecule recognizing pathogenic fungi. ?? 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

            "abstractNote": "Coagulation factor X is activated by the extrinsic Xase complex composed of factor Vila associated with the integral membrane protein tissue factor. The kinetics of human factor X activation was studied following reconstitution of this reaction system using purified human proteins and synthetic phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PCPS) or phosphatidylcholine alone (PC). Factor X activation was evaluated by discontinuous measurements of the amidolytic activity of the product, factor Xa, or continuously monitored using the fluorescent serine protease inhibitor 4-aminobenzamidine. The results of both techniques were verified by direct physical measurements of zymogen activation using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The rate of factor X activation with PC vesicles was less than 5% of that observed with PCPS vesicles. Since factor X does not bind to vesicles containing only PC, these data suggested an important role for the substrate-membrane interaction in the catalytic cycle. The importance of the substrate-membrane interaction in the activation process was investigated by using membrane-binding proteins to compete with the substrate for combining sites on PCPS vesicles. Prothrombin fragment 1 was an inhibitor of factor X activation. The dependence of inhibition by fragment 1 on PCPS and factor X was consistent with a significant reduction in initial velocity due to the displacement of factor X from the membrane surface. The inhibition data also suggested that the membrane-bound pool of factor X was the preferred substrate for the human extrinsic Xase complex. The influence of PCPS concentrations on the rate of factor X activation was systematically investigated. Increasing concentrations of PCPS resulted in a modest change in the Km,app and a dramatic change in the Vmax,app for the reaction. The initial velocity data could be globally analyzed according to the preferential utilization of membrane-bound factor X with the intrinsic kinetic constants: Km ≅ 1 μM and kcat = 37 s-1 at saturating PCPS. In addition, the equilibrium parameters for the factor X-membrane interaction inferred from these studies were in excellent agreement with the directly determined values. Collectively, the data suggest that the substrate-membrane interaction must precede catalysis for the efficient activation of human factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex.",

            "abstractNote": "Besides being an important source of fuel and structural components of biological membranes, free fatty acids (FFAs) are known to display a wide variety of roles that include modulation of receptor signaling and regulation of gene expression among many. FFAs play a significant role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by activating specific G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) in pancreatic β cells, immune cells, white adipose tissue, intestine and several other tissues. Free Fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) also known as GPR43 belongs to this group of GPCRs and has been shown to participate in a number of important biological activities. FFAR2 is activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate and butyrate. SCFAs are formed in the distal gut by bacterial fermentation of macro-fibrous material that escapes digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and enters the colon and have been shown to play vital role in the immune regulation and metabolic homeostasis. FFAR2 and other free fatty acid receptors are considered key components of the body’s nutrient sensing mechanism and targeting these receptors is assumed to offer novel therapies for the management of diabetes and other metabolic disorders. This review aims to summarize the current state of our understanding of FFAR2 biology with a particular focus on its role in metabolic homeostasis. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.",

            "abstractNote": "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a fatal lymphoproliferative disease that develops in human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected individuals. Despite the accumulating knowledge of the molecular biology of HTLV-I-infected cells, effective therapeutic strategies remain to be established. Recent reports showed that the hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor statins have anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on certain tumor cells through inhibition of protein prenylation. Here, we report that statins hinder the survival of ATL cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation is responsible for these effects, since simultaneous treatment with isoprenoid precursors, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or farnesyl pyrophosphate, but not a cholesterol precursor squalene, restored the viability of ATL cells. Simvastatin inhibited geranylgeranylation of small GTPases Rab5B and Rac1 in ATL cells, and a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-298 reduced ATL cell viability more efficiently than a farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277. These results not only unveil an important role for protein geranylgeranylation in ATL cell survival, but also implicate therapeutic potentials of statins in the treatment of ATL. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To test the hypothesis that the efficacy of HKY- induced protection may be due to the cross-reactive antigens in the cell walls of the different fungi, we studied the effect of HKY against systemic candidiasis. Male CD-1 mice were given different regimens of HKY subcutaneously prior to intravenous challenge with Candida albicans. Compared to PBS controls, the administration of HKY (6 × 10(7)) 3, 4 or 6 times prolonged survival (all P < 0.05) and reduced fungal load in the kidney (all P < 0.05). An HKY dose of 1.2 × 10(8) given 4 times prolonged survival (P = 0.02), but showed dose-limiting toxicity. HKY given by an oral route, or by a subcutaneous route with alum as an adjuvant, did not improve survival. Overall, we found that HKY protects mice from infection by Candida albicans in a dose-and regimen-dependent manner. To understand the protection induced by HKY against different fungal species, additional studies of epitope mapping are warranted.",
