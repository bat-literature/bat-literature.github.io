            "abstractNote": "Bats fly using a thin wing membrane composed of compliant, anisotropic skin. Wing membrane skin deforms dramatically as bats fly, and its three-dimensional configurations depend, in large part, on the mechanical behaviour of the tissue. Large, macroscopic elastin fibres are an unusual mechanical element found in the skin of bat wings. We characterize the fibre orientation and demonstrate that elastin fibres are responsible for the distinctive wrinkles in the surrounding membrane matrix. Uniaxial mechanical testing of the wing membrane, both parallel and perpendicular to elastin fibres, is used to distinguish the contribution of elastin and the surrounding matrix to the overall membrane mechanical behaviour. We find that the matrix is isotropic within the plane of the membrane and responsible for bearing load at high stress; elastin fibres are responsible for membrane anisotropy and only contribute substantially to load bearing at very low stress. The architecture of elastin fibres provides the extreme extensibility and self-folding/self-packing of the wing membrane skin. We relate these findings to flight with membrane wings and discuss the aeromechanical significance of elastin fibre pre-stress, membrane excess length, and how these parameters may aid bats in resisting gusts and preventing membrane flutter.",

Isolated populations of the endemic Australian orange leaf-nosed bat Rhinonicteris aurantia were used as an example since geographic isolation in different environments has been a precursor to differences in their characteristic echolocation call frequencies (mean difference c. 6 kHz; means of 114.64 and 120.99 kHz). The inﬂuence of both atmospheric temperature and RH on maximum prey detection range was explored through mathematical modelling. This revealed that temperature was of similar importance to relative humidity and that under certain circumstances, each could reduce the effect of the other on ultrasound attenuation rates. The newly developed models contain signiﬁcant conceptual improvements in method compared to other recent approaches, and can be applied to the situation of any other species of bat. For a given set of atmospheric conditions, the prey detection range of R. aurantia was reduced slightly when call frequency increased by 6 kHz, but an increase in RH, temperature or both reduced detection range signiﬁcantly. A similar trend was also evident in prey detection volume ratios calculated for the same conditions. Spatial volume ratios were applied to assess the impact of changed atmospheric conditions and prey size on foraging ecology. Reductions in detection range associated with increases in RH and/or temperature also varied in relation to the size (cross sectional area) of insect prey. Modelling demonstrated that small (6 kHz) movements in call frequency could not compensate for the changes in prey detection range and spatial detection volumes that result from signiﬁcant changes in atmospheric temperature or RH. The notion that differences in RH are the primary cause leading to adaptive evolution and speciation in CF-emitting bats by precipitating intraspeciﬁc differences in the mean call frequency of geographically isolated bat populations was not supported by the results of this case study.",

Body mass was lower, on average, during the dry-cool season and all species of fruit-eating bats showed an increase in oxygen consumption after noradrenaline injection and after exposure to a He–O2 atmosphere. However, the magnitude of this increase was similar in both seasons. BMR also did not vary between seasons. Although, our results showed for the ﬁrst time that all three species studied were able to increase thermogenesis by both nonshivering and shivering thermogenesis, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in any thermoregulatory variable measured when comparing data from the two different seasons. Probably the difference in the mean and variance of the temperature proﬁle between seasons were not strong enough to alter the thermogenic capacity of these species. Furthermore, the use of alternative physiological (torpor) or behavioral (huddling) strategies might have alleviated the need to trigger energetic-costly thermogenic responses.",

These responses vary according to several factors including taxon and energy constraints. Despite a plethora of studies on chiropteran variations in thermoregulation, few have examined African species. In this study, we used the Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi, body mass E115 g) to determine how the thermoregulatory abilities of an Afrotropical chiropteran respond to seasonal changes in Ta. Mass speciﬁc Resting Metabolic Rates (RMRTa) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were signiﬁcantly higher in winter than in summer. Furthermore, winter body mass was signiﬁcantly higher than summer body mass. A broad thermoneutral zone (TNZ) was observed in winter (15–35 1C) compared with summer (25–30 1C). This species exhibited heterothermy (rectal and core body temperature) during the photophase (bats’ rest-phase) particularly at lower Tas and had a low tolerance of high Tas. Overall, there was a signiﬁcant seasonal variation in the thermoregulatory abilities of E. wahlbergi. The relative paucity of data relating to the seasonal thermoregulatory abilities of Afrotropical bats suggest further work is needed for comparison and possible effects of climate change, particularly extreme hot days.",

For bats, pronounced torpor behaviour has been described. The aim of this study was to assess individual variation in torpor expression of male Myotis daubentonii, and to analyse whether this variation is related to habitat characteristics. For that we measured skin temperatures of bats from different habitats using radio transmitters and also recorded ambient temperature. Skin temperature was corrected for ambient temperature and individual body mass. Cluster analysis of residuals revealed two different thermoregulatory strategies. Males in cluster 1 were more often encountered torpid and reached lower minimum skin temperatures than males in cluster 2. The differences in behaviour were related to environmental variables (water surface area near the roost, roost altitude, precipitation, ambient temperature in the warmest quarter of the year). Males from cluster 1 occupied less favourable habitats (less water surface, higher altitudes, wetter and colder climate) than males from cluster 2. Our data suggest a linkage between torpor behaviour and habitat characteristics. These characteristics could be used to identify favourable and marginal habitats for M. daubentonii.",

            "abstractNote": "In the Neotropics, captive vespertilionid bats substantially reduce their metabolic rate at low ambient temperatures, similar to their temperate counterparts, whereas the ability of phyllostomids to lower metabolic rate seems to be more limited, even in mountain species. Nevertheless, field data on the thermal behaviour of syntopic individuals from these two families is lacking. Consequently, we aimed to test whether torpor was more common and deeper in vesper bats compared to leaf-nosed bats by studying skin temperature (Tsk) variation in individuals experiencing the same environmental conditions at a mountain area. Bats experienced ambient temperatures below 15 °C. Average Tsk was 10 °C in Myotis oxyotus gardneri (Vespertilionidae) during the day, while Sturnira burtonlimi (Phyllostomidae) regulated diurnal Tsk above 30 °C. Constant food availability may explain why diurnal Sturnira burtonlimi pay the high energetic cost required to remain normothermic and to defend a wide Ta–Tsk gap but further studies are needed to elucidate additional strategies that may be employed by these bats to reduce the energetic demands of normothermy. Our study shows that the contrasting thermal strategies and torpor use adopted by vespertilionid insectivores and phyllostomid frugivores in captive settings also occur in free-ranging conditions, thus providing a basis to develop further studies with predictions more accurately rooted in field data.",

            "abstractNote": "During the season of hibernation, temperate bats alternate between prolonged bouts of torpor with reduced body temperature and short arousals with a return to normothermy. Hibernating bats are sensitive to non-tactile stimuli and arouse following changes in microclimatic conditions or disturbance from other bats, potential predators, or humans. Here, we used temperature data loggers to register the skin temperature of 38 Myotis myotis bats over two winters (between January and March), during which regular visits were made to the hi­ bernaculum. Two kinds of arousal were observed, normothermic (Tsk > 25 ◦C) and cold (Tsk < 15 ◦C). Although bats responded to the presence of a researcher by arousals of both kinds, cold arousals were more frequent (63.8%). We found that mass loss was not affected by the number of disturbances, however it was in positive relationship with the mass at the beginning of the observation and differed between sex and age categories. Furthermore normothermic bats crawling among cluster-mates initiated arousal cascades, which mainly con­ sisted of cold arousals. We failed to detect any effect of age or sex on the number of arousals initiated by normothermic individuals. Warming by only a few degrees requires less energy than a normothermic arousal and we propose it is sufficient to activate the sensory system in order to assess the relevance of external stimuli. Our results indicate that cold arousals reflect a physiological and behavioural adaptation aimed at avoiding the energetic costs of disturbance that can lead to depletion of fat reserves.",

We quantiﬁed roost selection and thermoregulation in a captive Australian insectivorous bat, Nyctophilus gouldi (n ¼12) in winter when roosting in black and white coloured boxes using temperature-telemetry. We quantiﬁed how roost choice inﬂuences torpor expression when food was provided ad libitum or restricted in bats housed together in an outdoor aviary exposed to natural ﬂuctuations of ambient temperature. Black box temperatures averaged 5.1 °C (maximum 7.5 °C) warmer than white boxes at their maximum daytime temperature. Bats fed ad libitum chose black boxes on most nights (92.9%) and on 100% of nights when food-restricted. All bats used torpor on all study days. However, bats fed ad libitum and roosting in black boxes used shorter torpor and spent more time normothermic/active at night than food-restricted bats and bats roosting in white boxes. Bats roosting in black boxes also rewarmed passively more often and to a higher skin temperature than those in white boxes. Our study suggests that N. gouldi fed ad libitum select warmer roosts in order to passively rewarm to a higher skin temperature and thus save energy required for active midday rewarming as well as to maintain a normothermic body temperature for longer periods at night. This study shows that colour should be considered when deploying bat boxes; black boxes are preferable for those bats that use passive rewarming, even in winter when food availability is reduced.",

            "abstractNote": "Because body temperature is tightly coupled to physiological function, hibernating animals entering deep torpor are typically immobile. We analysed thermal behaviour and locomotory activity of hibernating greater mouseeared bats Myotis myotis and found two types of movement behaviour related to body temperature, i.e. movement at high fur temperature and at low fur temperatures (Tﬂow; < 5 °C). First Tﬂow movements appeared at the beginning of March and often occurred during long torpor bouts. In most cases, Tﬂow events represented slow displacements between clusters of bats. In several cases, however, departure or arrivals from and into clusters was also recorded without any elevation in body temperature. Distance travelled, ﬂight duration and speed of locomotion during Tﬂow events was lower than in high fur temperature events. Such behaviour could allow bats to save energy long-term and prolong torpor bouts. Tﬂow movement in torpid bats signiﬁcantly changes our understanding of basic hibernation principles and we strongly recommend further studies on the subject.",

However, its influence on macroevolutionary dynamics is not well un­ derstood. It has been suggested that diversification rates will be different in lineages with narrow thermal niches (specialists) to diversification rates in generalist lineages, but the evidence for this is elusive. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using the most diverse (in species richness and geographic range variation) tropical bat genus within the Phyllostomidae family. We estimated the realized thermal niche breadth of Sturnira species from their geographic range and categorized them as generalists, cold specialists, or warm specialists. We compared dy­ namic evolutionary models that differ in 1) niche breadth evolution, 2) parental niche breadth inheritance, and 3) whether niche breadth evolution is associated with shifts in diversification rates. Our best-performing model indicates that most Sturnira species arose as specialists in warm climates and that over time, their niche breadth broadens, and just a subset of those species becomes specialists in cold environments. We found that the evo­ lution of realized thermal niche breadth causes fluctuations in per-lineage rates of diversification, where warm specialists boast the highest speciation rates. However, we found no evidence of these changes in niche neither triggering nor being a result of speciation events themselves; this suggests that diversification events in Sturnira could instead depend on allopatric speciation processes such as the development of geographic barriers.",

A total of 755 Caribbean plant and vertebrate species are considered globally threatened, making it one of the top Biodiversity Hotspots in terms of threat levels. In 2009, Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) were identified for the Caribbean Islands through a regionallevel analysis of accessible data and literature, followed by extensive national-level stakeholder consultation. By applying the Vulnerability criterion, a total of 284 Key Biodiversity Areas were defined and mapped as holding 409 (54%) of the region’s threatened species. Of these, 144 (or 51%) overlapped partially or completely with protected areas. Cockpit Country, followed by Litchfield Mountain - Matheson’s Run, Blue Mountains (all Jamaica) and Massif de la Hotte (Haiti) were found to support exceptionally high numbers of globally threatened taxa, with more than 40 such species at each site. Key Biodiversity Areas, building from Important Bird Areas, provide a valuable framework against which to review the adequacy of existing national protectedarea systems and also to prioritize which species and sites require the most urgent conservation attention.",

Presence of 18 species of mammals, 55 species of birds and 13 species of reptiles were recorded from the river stretch including 16 species of global conservation significance. Maximum encounter rate was observed for little cormorant (3.160±0.290), macaque (2.385±0.442) and brown roofed turtle (1.009±0.107). Our study is an attempt towards generating baseline information on the faunal diversity of the upper Ganges and we recommend exhaustive surveys and regular monitoring of this river stretch through indicator species approach.",

As part of this, it is incumbent upon us to do all that we can to reverse the current trend of biodiversity loss, using all available tools at our disposal. One effective mean is safeguarding of those sites that are highest global priority for the conservation of biodiversity, whether through formal protected areas, community managed reserves, multiple-use areas, or other means. This special issue of the Journal of Threatened Taxa examines the application of the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) approach to identifying such sites. Given the global mandate expressed through policy instruments such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the KBA approach can help countries meet obligations in an efficient and transparent manner. KBA methodology follows the well-established general principles of vulnerability and irreplaceability, and while it aims to be a globally standardized approach, it recognizes the fundamental need for the process to be led at local and national levels. In this series of papers the application of the KBA approach is explored in seven countries or regions: the Caribbean, Indo-Burma, Japan, Macedonia, Mediterranean Algeria, the Philippines and the Upper Guinea region of West Africa. This introductory article synthesizes some of the common main findings and provides a comparison of key summary statistics.",

            "abstractNote": "Biologists have an imperfect understanding of the reproductive biology of bats, which is primarily limited to mating systems and development of neonates. Few studies have addressed parturition in bats. Most of these are not contemporary and are based on data obtained from captive animals housed in laboratories. No studies have been conducted to assess the natural parturition process of Geoffroy’s Rousette Fruit Bat Rousettus amplexicaudatus, a Yinpterochiropteran native to Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. This study provides the first comprehensive description of parturition in this species. It is based on the natural behaviors exhibited in a wild colony of R. amplexicaudatus in the southern Philippines, which were recorded using high definition video cameras. The qualitative birthing model developed in this study, based on data collected from 16 pregnant females, provides new insights into the reproductive biology of this species. Female R. amplexicaudatus give birth while hanging upside-down. Pups are born in the head-first presentation. Females do not immediately sever the pups’ umbilical cord after birth. Instead, the cord acts as a tether, preventing the pup from falling to its death in the event that it loses its grip on the female. This appears to be an adaptive strategy meant to help overcome some of the challenges associated with giving birth while suspended and hanging upside-down.",

It is hoped that the Mammal RDB will help Nepal achieve the Convention on Biological Diversity target of preventing the extinction of known threatened species and improving their conservation status. Of the 212 mammal species assessed, 49 species (23%) were listed as nationally threatened. These comprise nine (18%) Critically Endangered species, 26 (53%) Endangered species and 14 (29%) Vulnerable species. One species was considered regionally Extinct. A total of seven species (3%) were considered Near Threatened and 83 species (39%) were Data Deficient. Over sixty percent of Nepal’s ungulates are threatened and almost half of Nepal’s carnivores face extinction (45% threatened). Bats and small mammals are the least known groups with 60 species being Data Deficient. Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation are the most significant threats. Other significant threats include illegal hunting, small and fragmented populations, reduction of prey base, human wildlife conflict and persecution, climate change, invasive species, disease and inadequate knowledge and research. Adequate measures to address these threats are described. It was also concluded that re-assessments of the status of certain mammal groups be carried out every five years and the setting up of a national online species database and mapping system would also greatly help in land-use planning and policies.",

In Sri Lanka, this species was last documented in the year 1994 and no subsequent surveys recorded this species in Sri Lanka, thus considered rare in Sri Lanka. In contrast, within its South Asian biogeography, K. hardwickii is widely distributed, particularly in Southeast Asia. In this study, a single male of K. hardwickii was observed in lowland rainforest ecoregion of Sri Lanka near LabugamaKalatuwana Forest Reserve where the bat was roosting on a curled live banana frond. The bat was roosting 1.8m above the ground. This was the first instance K. hardwickii recorded in the lowland rainforests of Sri Lanka, which extends this species’ biogeography of Sri Lanka into the lowland wet zone. Thus, distribution range of K. hardwickii in Sri Lanka could be broader than historically documented. Intensive surveys, particularly in lowland rainforest regions, are required to validate the true distribution of this bat in Sri Lanka.",

Food resources were identified by collecting faeces, food remnants, and rejecta pellets beneath day roosts. Pteropus giganteus consumed fruits, flowers, and leaves of 14 species of plants. Six species of fruits were found in the faeces below the day roosts, 13 species of fruits and two species of leaves in the rejecta, and seven species of fruits and one species of leaf at the day roost. These observations indicate that P. giganteus is a phytophagous bat with rapid intestinal passage.",

Sparse research has been conducted in the Banpale forest and to improve the understanding of bat diversity, an updated species checklist was prepared. Trapping surveys using mist nets were conducted at four different locations in the forest from March to May 2018. This survey identified 55 individuals belonging to eight species within eight genera and four families. Trapping locations near less disturbed forest edges and water resources were found to have higher bat diversity compared to highly disturbed areas (e.g., landslides and logging areas). With information from survey and secondary source, we conclude that Banpale forest harbours 10 of the 53 bat species found in Nepal. We recommend adopting practices to conserve the forest from landslides and minimizing illegal logging to conserve bat forest habitats.",

This study assessed seasonal prey availability and diet composition of the Asiatic Lesser Yellow House Bat Scotophilus kuhlii in various districts of Uttar Pradesh between January 2016 to December 2018. Fecal and insect samples were collected seasonally using sweep nets between 1800 and 1900 h. From each location 20 fecal pellets were selected for analysis and searched for taxonomically recognizable remnants. The analysis revealed that S. kuhlii fed on Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Orthoptera, Odonata, Blattodae, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera, identified from legs, antennae and wings/elytra in fecal pellets. Seasonal variation in the presence of isolated insect remnants and insect abundance at foraging grounds was observed. Thus S. kuhlii is a voracious feeder and plays an important role as a pest control agent.",

            "abstractNote": "A systematic review was carried out to prepare a checklist of the mammalian species of northeastern India. The region is located between two prominent biodiversity hotspots, Himalaya and Indo-Burma. Though it is only 8% of the country, it supports almost half of the country’s total wild flora and fauna. Ongoing developmental activities such as the construction of roads, electrification, and mining in and around the wildlife habitats have threatened the survival of many species of wildlife. A lot of literature has been checked to understand the status and distribution of wildlife in the region and the present manuscript is prepared from existing literature. A total of 267 species representing 11 orders and 38 families from the region have been reported. A state-wise updated list of species along with their status as per IUCN, WPA (Wildlife Protection Act) of India, 1972 and CITES has been provided which is intended to serve as a baseline data for further research in mammalian fauna of the region.",

It is insectivorous in nature and plays an important role in the natural control of insects. Roost search and mist netting were conducted during early evening to 2200 h in three sites and the species was identified by field-based morphology including medium body size, pale gray brown color on the dorsal side, buffy white ventral surface, and face is necked and uniform mid-brown in color. A total of five individuals of Scotozous dormeri were recorded from east to west Nepal and the forearm ranged 34.4–36.00 mm in length. An individual was observed in a cavity in a pillar in a wooden house at Ramjhoda, Sunsari District. Two individuals each were trapped at the Morange River, Morang District in the east and Hattikhauwa, Dang District in the west. Three localities of the species’ record lie in the dry and arid sub-tropical areas. This study records the second to fourth locality records of the species distribution to Nepal.",

Kangkawat Research Station is a newly established research station in the Imbak Canyon Conservation Area, Sabah which encompasses both primary and secondary forest areas. Limited data is available on the small mammal diversity for this particular area. Therefore, a survey-based study on small mammal diversity was carried out between the 29th September – 8th October 2018 along the established trails within the vicinity areas of this research station. Small mammal trapping was done using traps (mist nets, harp traps, cage traps and pitfall traps) employed randomly along the Nepenthes trail, the Kawang trail, the South Rim trail and the Pelajau trail. This study documented a total of 32 small mammal species i.e. represented by 26 species (15 spp. of new records for ICCA ) of volant small mammals (Chiroptera) and 6 species of non-volant small mammals (Rodentia, Scadentia, Insectivora, Carnivora). The total number of specimens recorded was 108. A new distribution record on the Free-tailed Bat, Chaerephon cf. johorensis, was documented for Sabah and Borneo during this study.",

Study sites include forest islands isolated by water, and control plots in nearby continuous forest. Studies began 1 y before the onset of forest fragmentation and encompassed the first 3 y after flooding. Forest fragmentation greatly modified the diversity and abundance of bats. Changes occurred more rapidly in the smallest fragments than in the largest one, and trends were remarkably similar among all the studied islands. Bat captures in islands were characterised by the scarcity of understorey frugivores. Differences in home range size and foraging strategies may explain why understorey fruit bat species are more sensitive to fragmentation; than canopy ones. Changes in the frugivorous bat community may have indirect consequences on both the demographic and the genetic structures of plant populations inside forest fragments.",

Frugivorous bats and birds are ideal vectors for long-distance seed dispersal; therefore, studies of the food habits of frugivores and the specific identities of the dispersers are essential for understanding ecological patterns and processes in tropical environments. Studies related to succession processes, the frequency, number and composition of seeds dispersed by animals are essential in order to generate new data and hypotheses, consequently the method and quality of obtaining data are important.",

            "abstractNote": "A climate model, based on effects of water availability and temperature, was recently proposed to explain global variation in bat species richness along altitudinal gradients. Yet such studies are sparse in the tropics and nearabsent in Africa. Here we present results from an altitudinal study of bat diversity from Mount Mulanje, Malawi. Using ground nets, canopy nets and harp traps, we sampled eight sites across three habitat zones from 630 m to 2010 m asl. We assessed the inﬂuence of climatic, geographic and biotic variables on measures of estimated species richness, Fisher’s α, and an unbiased index of compositional turnover. We recorded 723 individuals and 30 species along the gradient, revealing a ‘low plateau’ pattern in estimated species richness, peaking at 1220 m, which is congruent with the global climate model. Measures of local habitat structure signiﬁcantly explained a large degree of variation in species richness and compositional turnover between sites. Fisher’s α was further signiﬁcantly correlated to mean annual relative humidity, suggesting a background climatic inﬂuence.",

Unravelling the mechanisms allowing multiple syntopic bat species to coexist can provide insights into community ecology. However, dietary information on component species of these assemblages is often difﬁcult to obtain. Here we measured stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in hair samples clipped from the backs of 94 specimens to indirectly examine whether trophic niche differentiation and microhabitat segregation explain the coexistence of 16 bat species at Ankarana, northern Madagascar. The assemblage ranged over 4.4‰ in δ15N and was structured into two trophic levels with phytophagous Pteropodidae as primary consumers (c. 3‰ enriched over plants) and different insectivorous bats as secondary consumers (c. 4‰ enriched over primary consumers). Bat species utilizing different microhabitats formed distinct isotopic clusters (metric analyses of δ13C–δ15N bi-plots), but taxa foraging in the same microhabitat did not show more pronounced trophic differentiation than those occupying different microhabitats. As revealed by multivariate analyses, no discernible feeding competition was found in the local assemblage amongst congeneric species as compared with non-congeners. In contrast to ecological niche theory, but in accordance with studies on New and Old World bat assemblages, competitive interactions appear to be relaxed at Ankarana and not a prevailing structuring force.",

Four successional stages (pasture, early, intermediate and late) were sampled in the northern part of the state of Minas Gerais. Bats were sampled using mist nets at three sites for each of the four successional stages (12 sites in total) during eight periods between 2007 and 2009. A total of 537 individuals were captured (29 recaptured), distributed among four families and 22 species. Bat abundance and richness varied in space, being higher in the late-successional stage, and over time, being signiﬁcantly lower during the dry season. When compared between guilds, only the abundance of omnivores varied signiﬁcantly during the sampled months. Our results demonstrate that areas of late-successional stages showed higher bat richness and abundance in comparison with areas undergoing secondary succession. Our results also suggest the use of early-successional areas as ﬂying routes by bats can lead to failure to detect differences in bat composition within successional gradients. We suggest future studies should assimilate landscape-level analyses into their studies to better evaluate the effects of successional gradients on bat assemblages.",

            "abstractNote": "In the vast Neotropic seasonal environment, the most diverse family of bats, the Phyllostomidae (leaf-nosed bats), includes up to 93 species. As the quality and quantity of food resources fluctuate in the habitats, diet heterogeneity is observed among bat species and regions of the Neotropics. In this study, we investigated by faecal analyses, how the dietary niche (DN) of eight Phyllostomidae bat species (Artibeus planirostris, A. fimbriatus, Carollia brevicauda, C. perspicillata, Chiroderma villosum, Glossophaga soricina, Platyrrhinus lineatus, and Sturnira lilium) that occur in a karstic area in the Midwest region of Minas Gerais, Brazil, change in response to seasonal food availability. We recorded the consumption of insects and nine plant families. Moraceae was the most frequent, followed by Piperaceae. Given that seasonal dietary changes can be subtle and hardly noticeable along with fluctuating habitat conditions, we performed the DN decomposition of the eight bats species into subniches, by analysing the data with the WitOMI, which is a decomposition of the niche into temporal subniches. By improving the accuracy and details of the results, we assessed the effects of abiotic (precipitation and environmental temperature) and biotic (quantity and quality of food resources) interactions within the phyllostomid bat community. For each species, we compared niche breadth and overlap and found higher values for the dry season among morphologically similar species. The results of our study suggest that ecologically similar bat species coexist occupying different DNs.",

Hematophagous (vampire) bats are those specialized to feed solely on blood and have served as a source of inspiration for researchers as well as for writers. Vampire bat attacks on humans have moved from the realm of science fiction to reality in Latin America and bats (including nonhematophagous ones) have assumed an important role in the transmission of rabies virus to humans. This article discusses the emerging role of bats as rabies virus transmitters, with particular emphasis on the role of hematophagous bats in the epidemiology of human rabies in Latin America. Possible reasons associated with the increasing risk of exposure to bats in this region are also discussed.",

The myotodont conﬁguration and steeply inclined lingual cingulid of m1-m2 separate Karstala from the Molossidae and most Vespertilionidae except Antrozous. Karstala differs from Antrozous in other molar details and from all molossids and North American vespertilionids in having a humerus with the combination of a rounded head, deep supraglenoid pit, long and high pectoral ridge, tiny olecranon fossa, and no notch between the medial side of the trochlea and spinous process. The new species is comparable in size to the larger known species of the Vespertilionidae and is the largest known bat in the Tertiary of North America.",

Using questionnaires, we aimed to determine the direct and/or indirect contacts of flying foxes in an Indonesian nature conservation area with domestic animals and humans living in the surrounding area. We surveyed 150 residents of 10 villages in West Java. Villages were classified into 3 groups: inside and/or within 1 km from the outer border of the conservation area and 1–5 km or 5–10 km away from the reserve’s outer border. Data were collected by direct interview using a structured questionnaire consisting of the respondent characteristics (age, sex and occupation); histories of contacts between flying foxes and humans, dogs and other domestic animals; and knowledge about infectious diseases, mainly rabies, in flying foxes. We found that flying foxes from the nature conservation area often enter residential areas at night to look for food, especially during the fruit season. In these residential areas, flying foxes had direct contacts with humans and a few contacts with domestic animals, especially dogs. People who encounter flying foxes seldom used personal protective equipment, such as leather gloves, goggles and caps. The residents living around the conservation area mostly had poor knowledge about flying foxes and disease transmission. This situation shows that the population in this region is at a quite high risk for contracting infectious diseases from flying foxes.",

However, while SARS-CoV uses the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cellular entry, no coronavirus isolated from bats appears to use ACE2. Here we show that signatures of recurrent positive selection in the bat\n              ACE2\n              gene map almost perfectly to known SARS-CoV interaction surfaces. Our data indicate that ACE2 utilization preceded the emergence of SARS-CoV-like viruses from bats.",

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT\n            \n              The henipaviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), are paramyxoviruses discovered in the mid- to late 1990s that possess a broad host tropism and are known to cause severe and often fatal disease in both humans and animals. HeV and NiV infect cells by a pH-independent membrane fusion mechanism facilitated by their attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Here, several soluble forms of henipavirus F (sF) were engineered and characterized. Recombinant sF was produced by deleting the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) domains and appending a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal sequence followed by GPI-phospholipase D digestion, appending a trimeric coiled-coil (GCNt) domain (sF\n              GCNt\n              ), or deleting the TM, CT, and fusion peptide domain. These sF glycoproteins were produced as F\n              0\n              precursors, and all were apparent stable trimers recognized by NiV-specific antisera. Surprisingly, however, only the GCNt-appended constructs (sF\n              GCNt\n              ) could elicit cross-reactive henipavirus-neutralizing antibody in mice. In addition, sF\n              GCNt\n              constructs could be triggered\n              in vitro\n              by protease cleavage and heat to transition from an apparent prefusion to postfusion conformation, transitioning through an intermediate that could be captured by a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat domain of F. The pre- and postfusion structures of sF\n              GCNt\n              and non-GCNt-appended sF could be revealed by electron microscopy and were distinguishable by F-specific monoclonal antibodies. These data suggest that only certain sF constructs could serve as potential subunit vaccine immunogens against henipaviruses and also establish important tools for further structural, functional, and diagnostic studies on these important emerging viruses.",
