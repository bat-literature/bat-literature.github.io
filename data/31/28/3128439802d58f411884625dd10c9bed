These activities make the presence of suitable roosts critical for population persistence. Many studies have identified important roost tree characteristics by comparing roost trees to random trees. However, if bats select trees that facilitate either torpor use or maintenance of normothermic body temperatures relative to the energetic demands of reproduction, then it follows that roost tree characteristics may vary similarly. We compared variation in roost tree and site selection by lactating northern long-eared bats to the pre- and post-lactation periods. Scores from 2 principal components were the best predictors of the variation in roost selection. Relative to pre- and post-lactation periods lactating bat roost sites had a high and relatively open dominant canopy with low tree density (both coniferous and deciduous) and roost sites were situated high in tall trees. Our result demonstrates that when managing for bat roost trees, within-season variation in roost tree use should be considered.",

While this may be troubling from a population perspective, these fatalities provide an opportunity to learn more about bat migration and the origins and summer distributions of migratory bats by using endogenous markers. Such markers include stable isotope values, which have been used to answer questions about ecological systems, such as trophic levels and food webs, and the origins and migratory routes of animals. To estimate the origins of migratory bats, we determined nitrogen (d15N), carbon (d13C), and hydrogen (d2H) stable isotope values of fur (d15Nf, d13Cf, d2Hf, respectively) from hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) killed at a wind energy facility in southern Alberta, Canada. We determined that mean isotope values varied among species, year, sex, and age class. d13Cf and d2Hf values indicated that silver-haired bats likely originated in the boreal forest, farther north and/or at higher elevations than the aspen parkland-like habitat suggested by the isotope values of hoary bats. IsoMAP analysis indicated that bat fatalities may have originated from a large catchment area potentially hundreds of kilometers away. Our data provide further evidence for a migration route along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains that is used by bats from across Alberta and beyond, and suggest that fatalities at a single wind energy site have the potential to have far-reaching ecological and population consequences.",

Measuring the impact on bat species of environmental changes brought about by urban development is crucial for bat species conservation. At which spatial scale does a gradient of increasing urbanization have the most significant effect on the distribution and activity of bats? To address this question, 3 sampling points in each of 24 green spaces (of different sizes, degree of “naturalness”, and presence or not of water) across Montréal Island were sampled over 3 separate nights in June and July 2006. Echolocation calls of bats were recorded with Anabat detectors. Bat activity was determined by species or group of species for each green space. Various habitat factors associated with the urban gradient were acquired using GIS along a range of spatial scales, from local to landscape scales (areas of 0.1 km to 2 km radius around sampling points). Results show that patterns of distribution and bat activity differ according to species. Bats of the Myotis genus and Perimyotis subflavus were found mostly in areas with a high percentage of forest cover and near running water. Eptesicus fuscus and Lasiurus cinereus appeared to be less selective, as they were distributed much more uniformly across the study area. The more local spatial scales (from 0.1 km to 0.5 km radius) seem to have had a predominant influence on habitat requirements of bats, particularly for forest-dwelling species.",

Eight sampling sites were established, both near and far from the rim. A total of 2,844 individuals were counted in a 5 000 m2 sampling area. Species richness was 84, distributed in 34 families. The most abundant species were Croton oerstedianus, Eugenia winzerlingii and Drypetes lateriﬂora, with Astronium graveolens being the only species in NOM-059SEMARNAT-2010. The basal area varied between 9.55 and 26.05 m2ha−1 and the density between 4 288 and 8 272 ind ha−1. The horizontal and vertical structure have an inverted J-shaped pattern. The structural diversity values have a positive relationship with biomass accumulation, which varied between 4.23 and 51.95 Mg ha−1. Results indicate that the heterogeneity and diversity of the vegetation surrounding the El Volcán de los Murciélagos cave constitute habitat characteristics that inﬂuence the bat species that inhabit the cave. The structural conditions and diversity correlated with biomass accumulation reinforce the need to generate conservation strategies for this multi-speciﬁc refuge.",

In particular, if highly mobile taxa are frequently absent from survey locations, methods that estimate a probability of detection conditional on presence will generate biased abundance estimates. Here, we propose a new estimator for estimating abundance of mobile populations using telemetry and counts of unmarked animals. The estimator assumes that the target population conforms to a fission-fusion grouping pattern, in which the population is divided into groups that frequently change in size and composition. If assumptions are met, it is not necessary to locate all groups in the population to estimate abundance. We derive an estimator, perform a simulation study, conduct a power analysis, and apply the method to field data. The simulation study confirmed that our estimator is asymptotically unbiased with low bias, narrow confidence intervals, and good coverage, given a modest survey effort. The power analysis provided initial guidance on survey effort. When applied to small data sets obtained by radio-tracking Indiana bats, abundance estimates were reasonable, although imprecise. The proposed method has the potential to improve abundance estimates for mobile species that have a fission-fusion social structure, such as Indiana bats, because it does not condition detection on presence at survey locations and because it avoids certain restrictive assumptions.",

            "abstractNote": "Quantifying the impact of anthropogenic development on local populations is important for conservation biology and wildlife management. However, these local populations are often subject to demographic stochasticity because of their small population size. Traditional modeling efforts such as population projection matrices do not consider this source of variation whereas individual-based models, which include demographic stochasticity, are computationally intense and lack analytical tractability. One compromise between approaches is branching process models because they accommodate demographic stochasticity and are easily calculated. These models are known within some sub-fields of probability and mathematical ecology but are not often applied in conservation biology and applied ecology. We applied branching process models to quantitatively compare and prioritize species locally vulnerable to the development of wind energy facilities. Specifically, we examined species vulnerability using branching process models for four representative species: A cave bat (a long-lived, low fecundity species), a tree bat (short-lived, moderate fecundity species), a grassland songbird (a short-lived, high fecundity species), and an eagle (a long-lived, slow maturation species). Wind turbine-induced mortality has been observed for all of these species types, raising conservation concerns. We simulated different mortality rates from wind farms while calculating local extinction probabilities. The longer-lived species types (e.g., cave bats and eagles) had much more pronounced transitions from low extinction risk to high extinction risk than shortlived species types (e.g., tree bats and grassland songbirds). High-offspring-producing species types had a much greater variability in baseline risk of extinction than the lower-offspring-producing species types. Long-lived species types may appear stable until a critical level of incidental mortality occurs. After this threshold, the risk of extirpation for a local population may rapidly increase with only minimal increases in wind mortality. Conservation biologists and wildlife managers may need to consider this mortality pattern when issuing take permits and developing monitoring protocols for wind facilities. We also describe how our branching process models may be generalized across a wider range of species for a larger assessment project and then describe how our methods may be applied to other stressors in addition to wind.",

            "abstractNote": "Urban development is detrimental to many wildlife species; however, endangered little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) may be attracted to human settlements, making them a synurbic species. Buildings likely provide high-quality roosting habitat, which may be a limiting factor in the boreal forest where trees are typically small and potentially unsuitable for hosting large maternity colonies. In the boreal forest, there are relatively few urban developments in a matrix of wilderness and apparently suboptimal natural roosting habitat; thus, we hypothesized that isolated rural villages were islands of summer habitat for little brown bats that may be important for their conservation and recovery. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between little brown bat activity, foraging rates, and proximity to rural villages. We expected bat activity and foraging rates to increase with proximity to villages, as bats should optimally forage near their roosts to minimize ﬂight costs. We used ultrasonic detectors to passively monitor bat activity near three rural villages in Yukon, Canada, and characterized bat habitat with forest measurements and remotely sensed data. Bat activity increased with proximity to village centers, but foraging activity did not, suggesting that human settlements in the boreal forest were important as roosting rather than foraging habitat. Bat activity was higher near water bodies and areas with relatively high densities of linear features (e.g., roads and transmission lines), perhaps because prey were most abundant near water features and along forest edges. The island phenomenon we observed (i.e., higher bat activity near villages) has also been documented in larger human settlements at lower latitudes, where urban areas provided better roosting habitat than surrounding agricultural matrices. Given that little brown bats were concentrated near rural villages, small human settlements should be a focus of conservation efforts in the boreal forest—particularly the identiﬁcation and protection of buildings used as maternity colonies. Our study advances knowledge of little brown bat habitat requirements in the boreal forest and identiﬁes habitats that may be important for their recovery.",

            "abstractNote": "The boreal forest is the largest intact forest in the world, and a refuge for species experiencing range retractions as a consequence of climate and landscape change. Yet, large tracts of the boreal forest are threatened by the cumulative impacts of climate change, natural resource extraction, agriculture, and urbanization, perhaps warranting a shift in focus from biodiversity conservation in intact wilderness to that in anthropologically modiﬁed landscapes. We investigated landscape features that inﬂuence the distribution of the endangered little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) in an urbanizing boreal landscape at two spatial scales. We hypothesized that little brown bat activity would be inﬂuenced by proximity to available building roosts, because roosts are a potential limiting factor for boreal bats. Secondarily, we predicted that bats would use potential foraging habitat, such as waterbodies, and would avoid young, cluttered forests at the landscape scale. We conducted acoustic surveys of bat activity at 210 sites distributed across the study area in Yukon, Canada, within 1-km grid cells. We tested a priori hypotheses with a set of candidate regression models, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Our hypothesis about the relative importance of anthropogenic roosts was not supported. Little brown bats were equally active in urban areas (high building density) and rural areas (low building density), perhaps because roosts were adequately available throughout the region. Instead, habitat use was driven by the distribution of potential foraging habitat, particularly waterbodies, which are important sources of aerial insect prey. Little brown bats also avoided young (≤100-yr-old) forest at the landscape scale (including areas regenerating after ﬁre), which may have been poor foraging or roosting habitat, and used areas with a smaller agricultural and industrial footprint. Our results suggest that waterbodies and mature forest are important little brown bat habitats that should be protected from urban encroachment. Proactive conservation of important habitat for species at risk is still possible throughout much of the boreal forest, where human densities are comparatively low and the urban footprint is currently small.",

Many secondary metabolites function in plant defense, but their consumption can negatively impact both mutualistic and antagonistic frugivores, often due to toxic properties of the metabolites or through nutrient absorption interference. Frugivores are assumed to maximize nutrient acquisition while avoiding or minimizing toxic metabolite intake, but the relative roles of co-occurring nutrients and secondary metabolites in foraging behavior are not well understood. Here, we used a neotropical fruit bat to investigate the interactive effects of nutrients and a broadly bioactive fruit secondary metabolite, piperine, on two essential processes in nutrient acquisition, namely foraging behavior and nutrient absorption. Through the manipulation of nutrient and piperine concentrations in artificial diets, we showed that captive fruit bats prioritize nutrient concentrations regardless of the levels of piperine, even though piperine is a strong deterrent on its own. Furthermore, our findings reveal that while piperine has no detectable influence on total sugar absorption, it reduces protein absorption, which is a crucial and limited nutrient in the frugivore diet. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering the interaction between co-occurring chemical traits in fruit pulp to better understand frugivore foraging and physiology.",

            "abstractNote": "Mercury negatively affects human and animal health. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining can be a major local source of mercury contamination, especially into aquatic systems in tropical areas. Animals associated with mercury-contaminated aquatic systems are at high risk of experiencing effects of this heavy metal, but it is not clear how far the effects may extend into nearby terrestrial systems. We report mercury contamination levels in bats in agricultural areas at increasing distances from gold mining (~3–89 km of distance). We hypothesized that bat mercury concentrations would differ between feeding guilds, land use types, and be higher at sites closer to gold mining areas. We collected 112 fur samples from 30 bat species and eight guilds, and provide the ﬁrst reports of concentrations in 12 species. All mercury concentrations were below the level at which health is likely to be affected (10 ppm). We found guild-inﬂuenced differences among mercury concentration levels, with the highest concentrations in aerial insectivores and carnivores, and the lowest in canopy frugivores. Our results suggest insectivorous and carnivorous bats may still be at some risk even at sites distant from aquatic mercury contamination. We did not ﬁnd an effect of agricultural land-use type on mercury concentrations within species or guilds, suggesting mercury contamination did not extend to agricultural sites from areas of gold mining activities, and that these agricultural activities themselves were not an important source of mercury. We conclude bats did not demonstrate a signature of mercury risk either as a result of proximity of gold mining, or as a result of agricultural activities.",

In North America, the fungal disease whitenose syndrome (WNS) has caused declines in many bat species. While the mechanisms of WNS have received considerable research attention, possible inﬂuences of contaminants have not. Herein, we review what is known about contaminant exposure and toxicity for four species whose populations have been severely affected by WNS (Myotis sodalis, M. septentrionalis, M. lucifugus, and Perimyotis subﬂavus) and identify temporal and spatial data gaps. We determine that there is limited information about the effects of contaminants on bats, and many compounds that have been detected in these bat species have yet to be evaluated for toxicity. The four species examined were exposed to a wide variety of contaminants; however, large spatial and knowledge gaps limit our ability to evaluate if contaminants contribute to species-level declines and if contaminant exposure exacerbates infection by WNS.",

Despite concern over declines in population size, no reliable methods have been developed for censusing colonies of this species that are both accurate and minimize disruption to the colony. The objective of this study was to use non-invasive thermal infrared imaging to census L. nivalis as individuals emerge from Emory Cave and to evaluate the success of this method for future monitoring efforts. We recorded 6 emergences of bats from Emory Cave (4 and 5 June, 4 and 5 July, 4 and 5 August 2005) using thermal infrared cameras. Recordings were manually reviewed, and peak emergence rate was determined to be 54, 159, and 61 bats min–1 in June, July and August, respectively. The greatest number of L. nivalis (at least 2742 to 2874) was present in July. Overall, our data suggest that thermal infrared imaging provides a more reliable and accurate estimate of the number of L. nivalis at Emory Cave than has previously been possible using extrapolation from surface area of the cave ceiling covered by bats.",

            "abstractNote": "A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These ﬁndings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.",

            "abstractNote": "The main factors threatening Myotis capaccinii (Bonaparte, 1837) are considered to be foraging habitat degradation and roost loss. Conservation strategies that focus on the protection of roosts are feasible as long as direct threats by human activities are correctly identified. However, before protection of foraging habitat can be implemented more accurate information is required. We review the available information of relevance to foraging habitat management for the species. Three main topics are considered based on the results of a radiotelemetry study on 45 ind. in 3 seasons: habitat dependence, features of foraging habitat, and spatial range. M. capaccinii foraged almost completely over aquatic habitats as in other telemetry studies. We discuss the importance of terrestrial habitats and the dependence of the species on aquatic habitats. It has been proposed that several factors affect habitat selection in this species. The presence of smooth, clutter-free water surfaces seems to be the most important structural factor, but we found that prey richness also affected habitat selection. Effects of features related to riparian vegetation and water quality are thought to vary according to local conditions. Preference for wide water bodies is probably linked to preference for smooth surfaces, where detection and trawling of prey is favoured. As highlighted by recent telemetry studies, we observed M. capaccinii foraging at long distances from the roost. Therefore, the area of application for conservation measures should be large: we suggest a protection radius of 20 km around roosts.",

The species occupies small caves in boulder fields in lowland woodland. Lepidoptera and Coleoptera dominate the diet, with a strong preference for the latter before and during the breeding season (November to April). Foraging areas change seasonally according to wind direction, and foraging occurs in gaps in the woodland. Mature native woodland is favoured due to the abundance of Coleoptera in this habitat. Habitat management on Silhouette has removed alien plants from around the roosts and improved foraging conditions for the bat. This has been accompanied by increases in foraging activity in managed areas and an increase in breeding activity. The population at La Passe on Silhouette has increased from 14 to 25 ind. in the 1990s to 32 in 2008. The management approach is to be extended to another area of Silhouette where bats have been located and should also be used on Mahé. Increases in human development activity on Mahé and Silhouette may threaten population recovery of this bat, and legal controls on development in appropriate habitat are urgently needed. With effective legal controls and intensive habitat management recovery of this species is possible.",

The long-term study, essential to estimate a reliable population trend, is linked to environmental changes as possible causes of decline. The main emergence was from May to July (Weeks 6−18) when 550 ± 190 (SD) P. pygmaeus were counted. Analysis showed that the year-to-year change in population size of female P. pygmaeus (ΔN ) and the time of the peak exit count of the females from the roost in May to June could be predicted from the integrated air temperature (degree days, D) between 1 January and 31 March. The regression of ΔN on D showed a statistically significant linear regression line defined by ΔN = 1.31−0.0015 D (R2 = 38.4%; p = 0.005). ΔN = 1.04 to 1.33 reflected a stable to increasing population (Years 1−7 and 15−20). ΔN = 0.78 to 1.00 reflected a stable to decreasing population (Years 8−14). The regression of the time of the first peak exit count, calculated as the number of weeks from 1 April, on D showed a statistically significant linear regression line defined by Weeks = 12.75−0.020 D (R2 = 32.8%; p = 0.008). Rising temperatures between January and March would be detrimental to P. pygmaeus populations.",

Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the ﬁrst review for 12 years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined signiﬁcantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970–1980, 1981–1999 and 2000–2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05–2.31, 0.08–0.19 ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000–2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated ﬂame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9 ppm lipid weight) and perﬂuorinated compounds (perﬂuorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09 ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors inﬂuence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and deﬁnition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term.",

In 4 yearly based surveys, we calculated a set of univariate metrics at species and assemblage level and also performing a diversity/dominance analysis (k-dominance plots) to evaluate temporal changes. Nine species of bats were present (eight classiﬁed at species level, one at genus level). Number of detected taxa, Margalef richness, and Shannon–Wiener diversity apparently decreased between 2005–2007 (one-blade turbine period) and 2009–2010 (three-blade turbines period). We showed a weak temporal turnover only between 2007 and 2009. In k-dominance plots, the occurrence curves of the years before the new wind farming activity (2005 and 2007) were lower when compared to the curves related to the 2009 and 2010 years, suggesting an apparent stress at assemblage level in the second period (2009 and 2010). Myotis emarginatus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus signiﬁcantly changed their relative frequency during the three-blade wind farming activity, supporting the hypothesis that some bats may be sensitive to repowering. Further research is necessary to conﬁrm a possible sensitivity also for locally rare bats (Miniopterus schreibersii and Plecotus sp.).",

There is a need for a better understanding of the effects of such degradation on Caatinga’s rich and singular biota. Bats form a large part of this biota, and are pointed as good bioindicators. Here, we used the micronucleus test –an easy-touse, accessible and cost-effective in vivo approach– to detect DNA damage in cells from bats of different species and feeding habits in three protected areas in the Caatinga, comparing them with samples from an industrial sugarcane plantation. We hypothesized that environmental disturbance would reflect in DNA damage, with lower levels of damage in the less disturbed protected areas. The frequency of micronucleated cells differed significantly between sites and feeding habits (carnivores > insectivores > frugivores > nectarivores > hematophagous) but did not differ between sexes. Alarmingly, the highest levels of DNA damage were in two strictly protected areas (Seridó and Raso da Catarina Ecological Stations).",

            "abstractNote": "Many vespertilionid bats roost in proximity to roo®ng timbers and are therefore potentially exposed to organochlorines used as wood preservatives. Organochlorines elevate metabolic rate (MR) in some vertebrate species and any such eect in bats may threaten survival. The aim of this study was to determine whether sublethal exposure to lindane aected the body mass, food intake and MR of pipistrelle bats Pipistrellus pipistrellus and whether any such eects were modi®ed by environmental conditions and the presence of co-roosting bats. Bats held indoors and receiving repeated doses of 50 mg of lindane lost mass (À0.26 g) relative to coroosting bats receiving either 10 or 0 mg. Lindane increased the mealworm intake of bats, those with 0.45 g of body lipid increased their mealworm intake by 0.29 g DW nightÀ1 when given lindane doses of 50 mg batÀ1 3 daysÀ1. The magnitude of this eect decreased as bats became heavier. Lindane signi®cantly increased MR in bats and the eect was most pronounced in lean individuals. Environmental temperature and the presence of co-roosting bats altered the impact of lindane, the pesticide-mediated elevation of MR being greater under cold conditions. It was predicted that, under the environmental conditions of the experiment, exposure to 50 mg lindane batÀ1 3 daysÀ1 would increase the 24-h MR of a 7.3 g bat by 3.4 kJ (15%) and that of a 6.3 g bat by 4.8 kJ (23%). Such sublethal exposure might constitute a signi®cant threat to free-living bats. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We measured renal mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations in bats from south-west England to determine how they varied with species, sex, age, and over time, and if they were likely to cause adverse effects. Residues were generally highest in whiskered bats (Myotis mystacinus). Compared with other species, pipistrelle (Pipistrellus spp) and Natterer’s bats (Myotis nattereri) had signiﬁcantly lower kidney Hg and Pb concentrations, respectively. Renal Hg increased over time in pipistrelles but the contributory sources are unknown. Kidney Pb did not decrease over time despite concurrent declines in atmospheric Pb. Overall, median renal metal concentrations were similar to those in bats from mainland Europe and 6- to 10-fold below those associated with clinical effect, although 5% of pipistrelles had kidney Pb residues diagnostic of acute lead poisoning.",

Together with the global climate change, the long-term surviving of many species of plants and animals is threaten, distributional patterns at global and regional levels are altered and it results in local assemblages of species that are quite different from those that currently constitute coevolved communities. .For this study, the species Myotis myotis was used as bioindicator and it was sampled from two caves in the south-east of Sicily, Pipistrelli chosen as control area and Palombara chosen as polluted area, to measure the concentrations of trace elements in fur and liver tissues. Results showed higher content of essential elements in fur in bats sampled from Pipistrelli. Conversely, higher concentrations of toxic metals in liver such as As, Cd, Pb and Hg were measured in bat samples in Palombara cave, where specimens have a hunting area extended within the boundaries of the petrochemical plant. Nevertheless, we cannot consider Palombara population as polluted by metal contamination since their tissue concentrations are overall lower than toxic thresholds values suggested for small mammals. Likewise, we cannot exclude other kind of pollutants as potential stressors of the examined population, contributing with the decreasing of bat colonies in Sicily. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the concentrations of ten non-essential trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb, Sr, Th, Tl) were determined in the tissues (whole body, skin-fur, skinned body, liver, kidney and bone) of lactant Tadarida teniotis from a nursery colony in Rome. A large number of bats from this nursery died before ﬂedging and had bone deformities and fractures. The concentrations of nonessential trace elements in bone and whole body were also analysed in adult specimens of Miniopterus schreibersii from a colony located in a natural park in Northern Italy. In lactant T. teniotis, the Pb concentration decreased in the following order: bone>liver>skinned body>whole body>skin-fur>kidney, and exceeded the toxic threshold associated with negative effects reported for different mammalian species. The levels of the other non-essential trace elements were within a range indicative of low environmental contamination in both species. Signiﬁcant interspecies differences (P < 0.05) were observed for concentrations of Pb and Ba, higher in the bones of T. teniotis, and of Cd, Hg and Sr, higher in the bones of M. schreibersii. In lactant T. teniotis, the different sources of Pb exposure, through inhalation and/or food, may represent a potential threat to the colony of this synanthropic European bat.",

Bats, which form about a third of all mammal species, are sensitive bioindicators, and may be particularly vulnerable because of their dependency on echolocation. Here we present the ﬁrst controlled ﬁeld experiment with free-living bats. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact phantom road experimental design, we examine the impacts of trafﬁc noise on their activity and feeding behaviour. Disentangling the impacts of trafﬁc noise from other co-varying exposures such as habitat quality, the experiment demonstrates a signiﬁcant negative effect on the activity of each of the ﬁve, ecologically different, species (genus for Myotis spp.) examined. This suggests that the results are widely applicable. The negative effects are largely attributable to noise in the sonic spectrum, which elicited aversive responses in all bat species tested,whereas responses to ultrasoundwere restricted to a single species. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that trafﬁc noise can affect bat activity at least 20m away from the noise source. For Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, feeding behaviour, as well as overall activity, was negatively affected. Ecological Impact Assessments are therfore needed wherever there are signiﬁcant increases in trafﬁc ﬂow, and not just when new roads are built. Further research is required to identify effective mitigation strategies, to delineate the zone of inﬂuence of road noise, and to assess whether there is any habituation over time.",

As many bat species are endangered, such a non-destructive method is particularly suited for this taxon. The present study analyzed the levels of two non-essential (cadmium and lead) and four essential metals (copper, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc) in hairs of three ecologically similar, sympatric bat species, Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii), Natterer’s bat (Myotis nattereri), and Brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) from an area in Central Hesse (Germany), as well as metal concentrations in soil samples from the bats’ foraging habitats. Applying a previously established protocol, the analyses were performed using microwave-assisted extraction followed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Cadmium and lead concentrations in hair did not differ significantly among the three studied species, whereas the following significant differences existed for levels of essential metals in hair. Manganese concentrations in hair were higher in M. bechsteinii and P. auritus than in M. nattereri and Cu concentrations were higher in M. nattereri than in P. auritus. Myotis bechsteinii showed higher Zn concentrations compared to P. auritus and lower Mo concentrations compared to M. nattereri. Reasons for the observed differences among the three studied species could be differential exposure to these metal elements in their foraging areas, related to variation in the species composition of their arthropod diet in combination with different metal levels in the respective prey species, and/or species-specific requirements for essential metals and related variation in physiological regulation of these elements in the bats.",

Considering the distribution and migratory characteristics of European bats, the negative eﬀects of wind power should be addressed on an appropriate scale. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on interactions between wind farms and bats in Europe, and compares it with the situation in the countries of the European boreal biogeographic region. We analyzed data from papers published in international and national scientiﬁc journals, focusing on studies conducted in Europe. The issue of the impacts wind power has on bats is clearly overlooked in most of the countries of the European boreal region, with low volumes of research available on the topic. This is probably due to fewer wind farms in the area, making this recent issue a less-prioritized topic. However, the Baltic Sea, and the countries surrounding it, are of extreme importance with regards to bat migration, especially for the Pipistrellus nathusii. Therefore, more research on wind power and bats is needed in this region, as well as more cooperation between all the stakeholders.",

Non-invasive methods are becoming more popular as research moves away from destructive methodologies. We present the first concentrations of 23 elements in Mops condylurus and Tadarida aegyptiaca (Molossidae) fur and blood from an opencast diamond mine and reference area using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Concentrations of B, K, Rb and Cd in the bats’ fur were significantly higher in the mining footprint compared to the reference area (P < 0.05). Other elements such as Zn and Hg were significantly higher in the blood of bats from the mining footprint than the reference area (P < 0.05), whereas Mn was significantly higher in the blood of bats from the reference area than from the mining footprint (P < 0.05). Sixteen of the 22 elements above the limit of detection, with the exception of Ba, were significantly higher in the fur samples than in the blood due to elements being incorporated over time into the fur as it grows, whereas blood reveals short-term exposure to elements. Concentrations of most of the elements were reasonably low except Al, Fe and Zn. In general, the element concentrations particularly in the fur samples were comparable with other international studies reporting elemental fur concentrations from anthropogenically impacted and natural areas. Fur and blood have the potential to be viable indicators of environmental toxicity, but research is required on toxic thresholds and physiological and ecological unknowns around element concentrations in bat tissues and organs.",

            "abstractNote": "In Europe, two bat lyssaviruses referred to as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLVs) types 1 and 2 (genotypes 5 and 6 respectively) which are closely related to classical rabies virus are responsible for an emerging zoonosis. EBLVs are host restricted to bats, and have been known to infect not only their primary hosts but also in rare circumstances, induce spillover infections to terrestrial mammals including domestic livestock, wildlife and man. Although spillover infections have occurred, there has been no evidence that the virus adapted to a new host. Since 1977, four human deaths from EBLVs have been reported. None of them had a record of prophylactic rabies immunization. Only fragmentary data exist about the eﬀectiveness of current vaccines in cross-protection against EBLVs. It is clear that EBLV in bats cannot be eliminated using conventional strategies similar to the control programmes based on vaccine baits used for fox rabies in Europe during the 1980s. Due to the protected status of bats in Europe, our knowledge of EBLV prevalence and epidemiology is limited. It is possible that EBLV is under-reported and that the recorded cases of EBLV represent only a small proportion of the actual number of infected bats. For this reason, any interaction between man and bats in Europe must be considered as a possible exposure. Human exposure through biting incidents, especially unprovoked attacks, should be treated immediately with rabies post-exposure treatment and the bat, where possible, retained for laboratory analysis. Preventative measures include educating all bat handlers of the risks posed by rabies-infected animals and advising them to be immunized. This review provides a brief history of EBLVs, their distribution in host species and the public health risks.",

Three major antigenic groups related to the antigenic variants maintained in domestic dogs, vampire bats and marmosets were identiﬁed. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the viruses from dog-related cases segregated into four sister clades: three associated with dog-endemic cycles in Brazil and one with the crab-eating fox cycle in the northeastern region of the country. The vampire bat- and marmoset-related viruses formed two independent groups. The topology of these clades was conserved when these samples were compared to virus representatives of the currently reported rabies endemic cycles in the Americas. These results indicated the presence of multiple endemic transmission cycles maintained in four different reservoirs, domestic dogs, crab-eating foxes, vampire bats and marmosets, which are being transmitted directly to humans and should be considered as a high-risk for rabies infection.",

In order to shed new light on the spatiotemporal trends of these reports, we analysed active and passive data from years 1985 and 2012, which included 61 076 samples from 289 counties of Chile. We found that from 1994 to 2012, more than 15 000 bat samples were submitted for diagnostics through passive surveillance, 9·5% of which tested positive for rabies. By contrast, the prevalence of infection was only ∼0·4% among the nearly 12 000 bat samples submitted through active surveillance. We found that the prevalence of dog rabies dropped steadily over the same period, with just a single conﬁrmed case since 1998. None of the 928 samples from wild animals, other than bats, were positive for rabies. Although there has been only one conﬁrmed case of human rabies in Chile since 1985, and a single conﬁrmed case in a dog since 1998, bats remain a reservoir for rabies viruses. While active surveillance indicates that rabies prevalence is low in bat colonies, the high proportion of positive bats submitted through passive surveillance is a concern. To prevent human rabies, local public health agencies should increase research on the basic ecology of bats and the role of stray dogs and cats as potential rabies ampliﬁers.",

            "abstractNote": "The Darkhadyn Khotgor wetlands are located in the northern part of Mongolia and are transected by both small and large rivers such as the Shishged and the Tengis. Many small lakes are present and the large lake ‘Tsagaan nuur’ (eng. White lake) is upstream of the Yenisei river. It is a land rich in biodiversity with pristine waters and an extreme continental climate. The Darkhadyn Khotgor wetlands are composed of three ecological zones, Siberian Taiga, forested steppe, and meadow valley. The area is surrounded by Ulaan Taiga strictly protected area (SPA) in the western part, Khoridol Saridag Mountains SPA in the eastern part, the Khuvsgul National Park (NP), and the watershed of Tengis and Shishged rivers in the northern part. The bat survey was conducted at Dood Tsagaan lake, Usariin Am, Tengis river, and in the Khuit cave at 21.06. 07.07.2010, 16.09. - 30.09.2010 and 15.10.2012. In our study areas, we recorded five species of Vespertilionidae Gray, 1821, including Myotis brandtii (Eversmann, 1845), Myotis petax Hollister, 1912, Myotis ikonnikovi Ognev, 1912, Plecotus ognevi Kishida, 1927, and Eptesicus nilssonii Keyserling et Blasius, 1839. Ikonnikov’s bat (Myotis ikonnikovi) is recorded for the first time in this region. In the Darkhadyn Khotgor wetlands, in addition, our study shows that bats go into hibernation very early in the fall due to the short summer-season in the wetlands. Our study of the Huit cave of Mongolia showed that Ognev’s long eared bat, Brandt’s bat and the Northern bat were all hibernating in this cave. We provide the first evidence that these bat species hibernate in a cave in Mongolia. In addition, bones of the Northern bat, Ognev’s long eared bat, Ikonnikov’s bat, eastern Daubenton’s bat and Brandt’s bat were found in this cave, indicating that all these bats occupy this cave either simultaneously or have occurred there in the very recent past. The Darkhad Khotgor has more extreme cold and wet climate compared to the northern forest areas of Mongolia. The species structure of bat community near Darkhad wetland is similar to that of Yakutia.",

The big colony of bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in the Escaba dam located at the Yungas forest is an emblematic case for the conservation of bats in Argentina. The objective of this study was to evaluate the perception and attitude about the bats of the people living around the Escaba dam in order to redirect conservation efforts and education plans. Semi­structured surveys and participant observation were used to survey the information; and generalized linear models to analyze the data. The local inhabitants do not recognize the diversity of bat species and mention only blood­sucking and insectivorous bats. The results show a positive trend in perception and attitude, influenced by the recognition of the role of bats as insect controllers and a feeling of identity generated by the colony. The perception becomes more positive as age advances and in those who reached the secondary level of education. New ways of measuring perception and attitude are presented, such as describing the forms of bat exclusion. All this must be considered in the development of the management plan, which should consider the possible local use of guano as a fertilizer, sustainable tourism and educational actions aiming at differentiating the species (i.e. this is not a hematophagous bat colony), the role of the colony at controlling possible diseases and the ecosystem services associated with these species.",

Anti-predator behaviours may reduce the probability of mortality because of predation, but they may also be associated with reduced foraging efﬁciency. Several behaviours of bats have been suggested to serve as anti-predator responses, and there is evidence that predation, particularly by avian predators such as owls, may be an important cause of bat mortality. Previous studies have attempted to determine whether predator presence affects bat behaviour when emerging from roost sites, but few have examined effects of predator presence on bat behaviour while foraging. In this study, we investigated whether foraging bats respond to predator cues by presenting bats with an acoustic cue simulating the presence of an owl. Within matched trials, which were conducted at different locations each of 18 nights, signiﬁcantly fewer bat detections were recorded at owl playback stations than at control stations (no auditory cue), suggesting an avoidance response by bats. An acoustic control (i.e. station playing woodpecker calls), however, did not have signiﬁcantly more detections than the stations playing the owl calls, suggesting that bats may simply be avoiding noise and more detailed investigation is warranted. Although evidence for owl predation on bats is minimal in North America, results of this study may indicate that the perceived presence of owls may represent a factor inﬂuencing the behaviour of bats while foraging.",
