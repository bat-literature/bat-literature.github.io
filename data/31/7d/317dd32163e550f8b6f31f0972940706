            "abstractNote": "Various bat species are expanding their ranges due to changes in climate and landscape. These range expansions should be monitored thoroughly because they may alter local bat communities. The steppe whiskered bat Myotis davidii, for instance, has probably expanded its range from Central Asia to Eastern Europe. However, monitoring the range expansion of M. davidii is challenging because M. davidii and its sister species M. mystacinus are morphologically similar. Here, we investigated whether M. davidii occurs in Austria, which would extend its known range to the North-West. To facilitate the morphological identification of M. davidii and enable efficient monitoring approaches, we propose a morphometric approach. We analysed morphometric data of 102 M. mystacinus and 78 M. davidii. We applied sex-specific linear discriminant analyses to investigate whether a combination of hindfoot length, tibia length and forearm length could be used to distinguish M. davidii from M. mystacinus. The discriminant functions correctly identified 88 % of females and 82 % of males of the genetically verified individuals. Combined with dental characteristics, bat workers can reliably identify M. davidii based on morphometric traits. To investigate whether M. davidii had been previously found in Austria, we applied the discriminant functions to data of 61 Austrian M. mystacinus specimens preserved in the Natural History Museum Vienna. Since we did not find M. davidii specimens in the museum’s collection – the most comprehensive of Austrian mammal collection – we presume that M. davidii is a relatively new element of the Austrian fauna. This indicates that M. davidii has expanded its range over the last decades. The discriminant functions will facilitate monitoring of this potential range expansion.",

            "abstractNote": "Sound level processing is a fundamental function of the auditory system. To determine how the cortex represents sound level, it is important to quantify how changes in level alter the spatiotemporal structure of cortical ensemble activity. This is particularly true for echolocating bats that have control over, and often rapidly adjust, call level to actively change echo level. To understand how cortical activity may change with sound level, here we mapped response rate and latency changes with sound level in the auditory cortex of the pallid bat. The pallid bat uses a 60-30 kHz downward frequency modulated (FM) sweep for echolocation. Neurons tuned to frequencies between 30 and 70 kHz in the auditory cortex are selective for the properties of FM sweeps used in echolocation forming the FM sweep selective region (FMSR). The FMSR is strongly selective for sound level between 30 and 50 dB SPL. Here we mapped the topography of level selectivity in the FMSR using downward FM sweeps and show that neurons with more monotonic rate level functions are located in caudomedial regions of the FMSR overlapping with high frequency (50e60 kHz) neurons. Non-monotonic neurons dominate the FMSR, and are distributed across the entire region, but there is no evidence for amplitopy. We also examined how ﬁrst spike latency of FMSR neurons change with sound level. The majority of FMSR neurons exhibit paradoxical latency shift wherein the latency increases with sound level. Moreover, neurons with paradoxical latency shifts are more strongly level selective and are tuned to lower sound level than neurons in which latencies decrease with level. These data indicate a clustered arrangement of neurons according to monotonicity, with no strong evidence for ﬁner scale topography, in the FMSR. The latency analysis suggests mechanisms for strong level selectivity that is based on relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Taken together, these data suggest how the spatiotemporal spread of cortical activity may represent sound level.",

            "abstractNote": "SARS-CoV-2 is a virus belonging to the betacoronavirus family, causing fatal respiratory disease in humans, which became pandemic in 2020. Italy is one of the most affected countries by COVID-19, particularly in the northern regions. Several studies consider COVID-19 a zoonotic disease and, since Italy is the repository of a high biodiversity, SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals can be considered as a reservoir of the virus or favor the spreading between animals and humans. In this work, we analyzed the amino acid sequences of ACE2 protein of the most common domestic and wild animals present in Italy. Among the latter, we focused on ACE2 of the Chiroptera species present in Italy to identify the primary reservoir in this region. First, we reproduced in silico the Chiroptera ACE2/viral spike (S) protein interactions on the human ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 S complex model and identiﬁed the critical residues for the binding. In silico molecular docking of ACE2 belonging to Chiroptera vs SARS-CoV-2 S protein pointed to Rhinolophus ferrumequinum as a bat living in Italy, that may be a potential primary reservoir of the virus. On the other hand, a sequence similarity search on ACE2 of domestic and wild animals living in Italy pointed to domestic (horses, cats, cattle and sheep) and wild (European rabbits and grizzly bears) animal species as potential SARS-CoV-2 secondary reservoirs. Molecular docking of ACE2 belonging to these species vs S protein of Bat coronavirus (Bt-CoV/Rp3/2004) suggests that the primary reservoir Rhinolophus ferrumequinum may infect the secondary reservoirs, domestic and worldwide animals living in Italy, determining a speciﬁc risk of SARS-CoV2 infection.",

However, it is also the source of a major pathway to the cerebellum, via the pontine gray (PG). We compared auditory responses from single neurons in the medial geniculate body (MGB) and PG of the awake big brown bat. MGB neurons were selective for a variety of stimulus types whereas PG neurons only responded to pure tones or simple FM sweeps. Best frequencies (BF) in MGB ranged from 8 kHz to > 80 kHz. BFs of PG neurons were all above 20 kHz with a high proportion above 60 kHz. The mean response latency was 19 ms for MGB neurons and 11 ms for PG neurons. MGB and PG contained neurons with a variety of discharge patterns but the most striking difference was the proportion of neurons with responses that lasted longer than the stimulus duration (MGB 13%, PG 58%). Both nuclei contained duration-sensitive neurons; the majority of those in MGB were band pass whereas in the PG they were long pass. Over half of the neurons in both nuclei were binaural. Differences between these nuclei are consistent with the idea that the thalamocortical pathway performs integration over time for cognitive analysis, thereby increasing selectivity and lengthening latency, while the colliculopontine pathway, which is more concerned with sensory-motor control, provides rapid input and a lasting trace of an auditory event.",

            "abstractNote": "The blood-sucking bat Desmodus rotundus (Geoffroy, 1810) is a widely distributed zoonotic vector. The purposes of this study were to assess its ectoparasitic fauna and to compile a checklist of the parasitic arthropods in bats from Peru. The bats were captured in the San Bartolomé district, Huarochirí Province, Lima, Peru. A checklist was compiled based on online databases. Twenty-seven bats were studied, of which 70.37% (n = 19) were infected with at least one species of ectoparasite, including the Diptera Strebla wiedemanni Kolenati, 1856, and Trichobius parasiticus Gervais, 1844, and the ixodid Ornithodoros peruvianus Kohls, Clifford & Jones, 1969. The ectoparasite with the highest abundance and prevalence was O. peruvianus. We report three species of lice on D. rotundus, which we consider as accidental parasites. According to our checklist, 104 species of ectoparasites have been reported from 75 species of bats in 19 regions of Peru, including Diptera, Hemiptera, Siphonaptera, Phthiraptera, Mesostigmata and Ixodida. Aspidoptera falcata Wenzel, 1976 and Megistopoda aranea (Coquillett, 1899) (Streblidae) are the ectoparasites with the highest number of registered hosts. Lophostoma silvicolum d’Orbigny, 1836; Phyllostomus elongatus (Geoffroy, 1810) and Phyllostomus hastatus (Pallas, 1767) are the hosts with the most records of ectoparasites in bats from Peru (s = 10). According to the level of specificity of the ectoparasites for their hosts, the monoxenous species (s = 47) predominate, followed by oligoxenous species (s = 21). The geographical regions with most host-parasite reports were Loreto and Madre de Dios. Further research is needed since there are no ectoparasite records for 60.3% of bat species in Peru.",

The study of its migratory habits has shed light on patterns of movement and routes that animals follow, and how these movements affect the genetic composition of its populations. Delimiting the boundaries of breeding populations is of great importance for conservation, however, determining these boundaries has been difﬁcult for L. yerbabuenae. Understanding the demographic history of the species could provide additional insight into current differences of its migratory behaviour and reproductive asynchrony. Here, we report evidence of historical matrilineal structure by comparing partial sequences of mtDNA cytochrome b (bp 306) and Control Region (497 bp) and inferred patterns of differentiation across the distribution of L. yerbabuenae in Mexico. Our population-based statistical analysis suggests panmixia among colonies with low genetic differentiation between north-western and south-eastern colonies. Neutrality tests of the Control Region indicate the presence of two divergent mitochondrial lineages in the south-east and the north-west of Mexico. Our results corroborate recent population expansion events, possibly due to the inﬂuence of physical barriers to migration and historical population demography. We recognize one single population but two Conservation Units (CUs) based on differences in reproductive phenology, migratory behaviour and the evidence of two matrilineal lineages as found in this study. We recommend the use of large-scale genomic datasets to better delimit ﬁne-scale population structure in the future.",

However, the signiﬁcance of these changes is based on the species-speciﬁc susceptibility to WNS. We used acoustically recorded echolocation passes obtained at Fort Drum, New York to describe changes in bat activity pre-WNS (2004e2007) to post-WNS (2008e2018). We examined seasonal and yearly changes in bat activity as they relate to the presence of WNS at hibernacula near (<25 km) Fort Drum. A priori, we expected that overall activity for communal hibernating species would be less in years following WNS, and migratory bats or those hibernating bats that are less affected by WNS would show no response or a positive response, due to niche relaxation/competitive release. Our results indicated both an overall and seasonal decrease in activity for Myotis spp. post-WNS. For WNS-susceptible species, our results reﬂect the high level of mortality in regional winter hibernacula postWNS and possibly variable reproductive effort and recruitment thereafter. Although migratory bats did show increases in post-WNS activity throughout the summer, we found little evidence that community displacement was occurring on a nightly level by any species. The continuous spread of WNS across North America has had strong negative effects on bat populations of affected species, and our research identiﬁes how individual species (both impacted and non-impacted) respond to WNS.",

            "abstractNote": "Long-distance seed dispersal can be important for the regeneration of forested habitats, especially in regions where deforestation has been severe. Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) have considerable potential for long-distance seed dispersal. We studied the movement patterns and feeding behaviour of the endemic Madagascan flying fox Pteropus rufus, in Berenty Reserve, southeast Madagascar. Between July and September 2012 (the dry season) nine males and six females were tagged with customised GPS loggers which recorded fixes every 2.5 min between 18.00 and 06.00 h. The combined home range of all of the tagged bats during 86 nights exceeded 58,000 ha. Females had larger home ranges and core foraging areas and foraged over longer distances (average 28.1 km; median 26.7 km) than males (average 15.4 km; median 9.5 km). Because the study was conducted during the gestation period, the increased energy requirements of females may explain their greater mean foraging area. Compositional analysis revealed that bats show strong preferences for overgrown sisal (Agave sisalana) plantations (a mix of shrub, trees and sisal plants) and remnant riverside forest patches. Sisal nectar and pollen were abundant food sources during the tracking period and this probably contributed to the selective use of overgrown sisal plantations. The bats also ate large quantities of figs (Ficus grevei) during the study, and dispersed seeds of this important pioneer species. The bats flew at an average speed of 9.13 m/s, perhaps to optimise gliding performance. The study confirms that P. rufus has the potential to be a long-distance seed disperser, and is able to fly over a large area, often crossing cleared parts of its habitat. It potentially plays an important role in the regeneration of threatened forest habitats in this biodiversity hotspot.",

In Bechstein's bats (Myotis bechsteinii), body size has increased over the last decades in response to warmer summers. If this trend continues it may threaten populations as larger females exhibit higher mortality. To assess the evolutionary potential of body size, we applied a Bayesian ‘animal model’ to estimate additive genetic variance, heritability and evolvability of body size, based on a 25-­year pedigree of 332 wild females. Both heritability and additive genetic variance were reduced in hot summers compared to average and cold summers, while evolvability of body size was generally low. This suggests that the observed increase in body size was mostly driven by phenotypic plasticity. Thus, if warm summers continue to become more frequent, body size likely increases further and the resulting fitness loss could threaten populations.",

We have studied its geological, geomorphic, socio-cultural and historical dimensions in a holistic way. The basal member of the Antalo Limestone, in which the Zeyi cave is located, consists of grainstone and wackestone with subordinate marly interlayers. Over a length of 364 m, the oval-shaped gallery displays stalagmites, stalactites, five columns, dissolution holes (“bell-holes”) following joints, stalagmitic floors and other concretions or speleothems. In the absence of any dating of the cave, we contrasted its elevation above the current local base level with known average incision rates of the northern Ethiopian highlands to reconstruct its age, which was calculated as at least 2 to 4 million years. The palaeo-environmental information that is archived in the Zeyi cave sediment would hence cover the Pleistocene. The graves in the sediment at the bottom of the Zeyi cave further indicate that the place could be an ancient burial site, which gives scope for archaeological research. Zeyi boosts a unique combination of abiotic, biotic and cultural components: the nineteenth c. church under the overhanging cliff; the unique cave; the speleothems, cliffs and gorges; and the cave’s bat colony which has been genetically confirmed to be composed of three syntopically roosting species. Accounting for a good balance between cave research, community-based geotourism, geoconservation and biodiversity conservation, the Zeyi cave has strong credentials to become a top geotouristic site in northern Ethiopia. However, major work needs to be done, including granting access for women and organising community-based geotourism.",

The reabsorption process involves proteins such as aquaporins (AQP), which has been described in the male genital system of limited species, including primate, rodents, cats and dogs. To contribute with information about AQPs in the male system, here we investigated the distribution of AQP1 and AQP9 in the tropical bat Artibeus lituratus, along the annual reproductive cycle. A. lituratus is a seasonal breeder with natural variation in components of the androgen and estrogen responsive system, thus being a good model for exploring the AQPs modulation. AQP1 was found restricted to differentiating spermatids, efferent ductules epithelium and venular endothelia along the male tract. AQP9 was detected throughout the epididymis being more abundant in the cauda and ductus deferens, but was not found in testis, rete testis and efferent ductules. Contrasting with AQP1 which appear to be constitutively expressed, there was seasonal variation in AQP9 expression, which was reduced in regressed epididymis. The AQP9 does not appear to be modulated by estradiol or androgens, but possibly by other factor related to luminal sperm. The establishment of speciﬁc function for aquaporins in the male tract remains undetermined; however, the cellular distribution presently found are compatible with the main function of AQP1, as a selective water channel, and AQP9, which is a conduct for water and a plethora of neutral solutes present in the epididymis milieu such as glycerol and urea.",

            "abstractNote": "The efferent ductules (ED) are a major target for estrogens, which act via the estrogen receptors ERa (ESR1) and ERb (ESR2). ERa has been found in the ED of all species studied so far. However, in the epididymis (EP), the expression of ERa is controversial, as is data about the occurrence of aromatase in the epithelium lining the excurrent ducts. Therefore, to further investigate this estrogen-responsive system, we used a seasonal breeder, the Neotropical bat, Artibeus lituratus, in which testicular expression of androgen (AR) and estrogen (ER) receptors vary with reproductive phase. The localization of aromatase, ERa, ERb and AR in the ED and EP of A. lituratus was investigated. The results showed that aromatase, AR and ERb were distributed throughout the excurrent ducts and did not vary during the annual reproductive cycle. Conversely, ERa was detected primarily in the ED epithelium, had marked seasonal variation and was increased during regression, especially in the EP epithelium. The results suggest that ERa may be involved in preparing the male genital tract for recrudescence. Together, the data obtained under natural conditions emphasize that speciﬁc segments of the excurrent ducts downstream of the testis are the primary targets for estrogen action via ERa, which is similar to previous ﬁndings in animals lacking functional ERa.",

The ectoparasites collected were one species of flea, Sternopsylla distincta (Rothschild, 1903), and three species of mites, Chiroptonyssus robustipes (Ewing, 1925), Ewingana inaequalis (Ewing, 1938) and Notoedres lasionycteris (Boyd & Bernstein, 1950). The 100% of bats were parasited and 3,185 ectoparasites were collected. C. robustipes was the most common species with a 100% of prevalence. N. lasionycteris, E. inaequalis and S. distincta presented 40.0, 32.24 and 8.89% of prevalence respectively. The mean intensity of infestation was greater for C. robustipes with 34.25 mites/bats and in others species the intensity was a 2% lower. The prevalence and intensity of E. inaequalis and N. lasionycteris were significatively greater in males, while for S. distincta the prevalence was slightly greater only in females. The prevalence and intensity of some ectoparasites showed to be dependent on the host sex.",

            "abstractNote": "The testis is a classical target for androgens, especially testosterone, acting via androgen receptor (AR). Alternatively, androgens can be aromatized to produce estrogens which act via speciﬁc receptors ERa and ERb. Although estrogen action is essential for maintenance of male fertility, studies regarding the expression of ERa and ERb in testis are restricted to a few species of rodent and domestic animals, but rarely in wild species. To our knowledge, there are no studies in Chiroptera species. Chiroptera represent one of the largest and most diversiﬁed orders of mammals, which possess several interesting reproductive features, including higher afﬁnity of SHBG for estrogens than androgens. Therefore, we thought that bats would constitute a good model for investigation of the role of estrogens in the male. In this study, the distribution of ERa, ERb and AR were evaluated in the testis of the big fruit-eating bat Artibeus lituratus and their levels were compared during reproductive and regressive periods. The results showed that ERa and AR were restricted to the somatic cells of the testis, whereas ERb was widely distributed in both somatic and spermatogenic cells in a cellular and stage-speciﬁc fashion. We demonstrated for the ﬁrst time by immunohistochemistry, and conﬁrmed by Western blotting, that ERb and AR increased during regression. The localization of ERa, ERb and AR in a seasonal, cell and stage-speciﬁc fashion in the testis of A. lituratus suggests that these receptors may play important roles in testis function during reproductive and non-reproductive periods.",

            "abstractNote": "Earlier, we showed that micro RNA-132 (miR-132) regulate the immediate early genes (IEGs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) of fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx during olfactory learning. This study was designed to examine whether the miR-132 regulate other proteins in OB during olfactory learning. To test this, miR-132 anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) was delivered to the OB and then trained to novel odor. The 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis showed that inhibition of miR-132 altered olfactory training induced expression of 321 proteins. Further, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis reveals the identity of differently expressed proteins such as phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing protein (PRTFDC 1), Sorting nexin-8 (SNX8), Creatine kinase B-type (CKB) and Annexin A11 (ANX A11). Among them PRTFDC 1 showing 189 matching peptides with highest sequence coverage (67.0%) and protein-protein interaction analysis showed that PRTFDC 1 is a homolog of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 (HPRT-1). Subsequent immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) showed that inhibition of miR-132 down-regulated HPRT expression in OB of C. sphinx. In addition, western blot analysis depicts that HPRT, serotonin transporter (SERT), N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptors (2A,B) were down-regulated, but not altered in OB of non-sense oligodeoxynucleotide (NSODN) infused groups. These analyses suggest that miR-132 regulates the process of olfactory learning and memory formation through SERT and NMDA receptors signalling, which is possibly associated with the PRTFDC1-HPRT interaction.",

            "abstractNote": "Order Chiroptera is a unique group of mammals whose members have attained self-powered ﬂight as their main mode of locomotion. Much speculation persists regarding bat evolution; however, lack of sufﬁcient molecular data hampers evolutionary and conservation studies. Of ~ 1200 species, complete mitochondrial genome sequences are available for only eleven. Additional sequences should be generated if we are to resolve many questions concerning these fascinating mammals. Herein, we describe the complete mitochondrial genomes of three bats: Corynorhinus raﬁnesquii, Lasiurus borealis and Artibeus lituratus. We also compare the currently available mitochondrial genomes and analyze codon usage in Chiroptera. C. raﬁnesquii, L. borealis and A. lituratus mitochondrial genomes are 16438 bp, 17048 bp and 16709 bp, respectively. Genome organization and gene arrangements are similar to other bats. Phylogenetic analyses using complete mitochondrial genome sequences support previously established phylogenetic relationships and suggest utility in future studies focusing on the evolutionary aspects of these species. Comprehensive analyses of available bat mitochondrial genomes reveal distinct nucleotide patterns and synonymous codon preferences corresponding to different chiropteran families. These patterns suggest that mutational and selection forces are acting to different extents within Chiroptera and shape their mitochondrial genomes.",

However, seed dispersal studies are primarily focused on a subset of these animal communities that disperse seeds by endozoochory. Stomatochory (seed dispersal in which seeds are carried externally and are not swallowed) is rarely considered to be effective, despite an increasing number of taxa‐focused studies that indicate otherwise.\n                \n                \n                  We collated the available information on stomatochory to provide a quantitative overview of the dispersal mechanism, including plant types and fruit traits dispersed, dispersal distances and germination potential for all available taxa. We compared seed sizes dispersed, dispersal distances and germination potential with corresponding data on endozoochory for bats and primates. We also identified the main taxa dispersing seeds by stomatochory and assessed what factors influenced the distances that they carried seeds to.\n                \n                \n                  Stomatochoric dispersers can displace large quantities of seeds, including large seeds and those of large fruits, and over short to long distances (>1 km). Compared with similar‐sized endozoochoric dispersers, they can disperse larger seeds, but over shorter distances, on average. Similar to endozoochory, seed handling by stomatochory also improves the germination potential of dispersed seeds. Dispersal distances achieved by stomatochory were influenced by body mass, daily path length, seed width, fruit type and seed handling techniques.\n                \n                \n                  Five main taxonomic groups of stomatochoric dispersers were identified: bats, parrots, squirrels, corvids and Old World monkeys (cercopithecines). Parrots perform dispersal services for the largest fruits and over the longest distances. However, given the lack of research on stomatochory, it is likely other taxa are also important stomatochoric dispersers but have not been identified yet.\n                \n                \n                  More research attention must be directed towards seed dispersal services that are not provided by endozoochory. Many stomatochoric dispersers are common animals within communities and could be playing dominant seed dispersal roles, even without swallowing seeds. Community‐wide studies should incorporate all seed dispersal interactions, rather than focusing solely on endozoochory. This will ensure a more robust understanding of community‐wide patterns.\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Read the free\n              Plain Language Summary\n              for this article on the Journal blog.",

When flower visitors alternate between two species of flower, heterospecific pollen transfer takes place. The impact of these mixed loads on the female reproductive success of a recipient has received considerable attention, but the concomitant loss of male reproductive success – because of pollens grains being lost to foreign stigmas – has received less. Furthermore, pollen losses are not limited to grains that land on stigmas, but can also include deposition on non‐stigmatic surfaces of the intervening flowers, or loss from the animal’s body through passive detachment or active grooming. We collectively term these losses because of competition ‘pollen misplacement’.\n            \n            \n              2.\n               Here, we quantify pollen transferred by nectar bats between focal flowers (\n              Aphelandra acanthus\n              ) with and without intervening visits to one of two competitor species. One competitor (\n              Centropogon nigricans\n              ) places its pollen in the same region of bats’ heads as the focal species, while the other (\n              Burmeistera sodiroana\n              ) places its pollen farther forward.\n            \n            \n              3.\n               We found that (i) any intervening visit caused some reduction in the number of pollen grains transferred, (ii) competitor flowers with similar pollen‐placement locations caused greater reductions in pollen transfer and (iii) of these competitors, those in male phase (dispensing pollen) caused greater pollen loss than those in female phase (without pollen).\n            \n            \n              4.\n               This study provides rare empirical support for the detrimental effects of competition for pollination on male fitness via pollen misplacement and is the first to show an added cost imposed by male‐phase competitors. Although this competition is especially strong when competitors overlap in pollen placement, diverging in pollen placement will not completely eliminate pollen loss during visits to foreign flowers, simply because pollen sheds or is groomed from pollinator’s bodies at some background rate over time. This suggests that any angiosperms that share pollinators face pervasive selection through male fitness to diverge in floral traits, alleviating competition by attracting different pollinators, altering floral phenology or encouraging floral constancy.\n            \n          , \n            \n              Lay Summary",

            "abstractNote": "The control of vampire bat rabies (VBR) in Brazil is based on the culling of Desmodus rotundus and the surveillance of outbreaks caused by D. rotundus in cattle and humans in addition to vaccination of susceptible livestock. The detection of anti-rabies antibodies in vampire bats indicates exposure to the rabies virus, and several studies have reported an increase of these antibodies following experimental infection. However, the dynamics of anti-rabies antibodies in natural populations of D. rotundus remains poorly understood. In this study, we took advantage of recent outbreaks of VBR among livestock in the Sao Paulo region of Brazil to test whether seroprevalence in D. rotundus reﬂects the incidence of rabies in nearby livestock populations. Sixty-four D. rotundus were captured during and after outbreaks from roost located in municipalities belonging to three regions with different incidences of rabies in herbivores. Sixteen seropositive bats were then kept in captivity for up to 120 days, and their antibodies and virus levels were quantiﬁed at different time points using the rapid ﬂuorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). Antibody titers were associated with the occurrence of ongoing outbreak, with a higher proportion of bats showing titer >0.5 IU/ml in the region with a recent outbreak. However, low titers were still detected in bats from regions reporting the last outbreak of rabies at least 3 years prior to sampling. This study suggests that serological surveillance of rabies in vampire bats can be used as a tool to evaluate risk of outbreaks in at risk populations of cattle and human.",

            "abstractNote": "Prestin is an integral membrane motor protein located in outer hair cells of the mammalian cochlea. It is responsible for electromotility and required for cochlear ampliﬁcation. Although prestin works in a cycle-by-cycle mode up to frequencies of at least 79 kHz, it is not known whether or not prestin is required for the extreme high frequencies used by echolocating species. Cetaceans are known to possess a prestin coding gene. However, the expression and distribution pattern of the protein in the cetacean cochlea has not been determined, and the contribution of prestin to echolocation has not yet been resolved. Here we report the expression of the protein prestin in ﬁve species of echolocating whales and two species of echolocating bats. Positive labeling in the basolateral membrane of outer hair cells, using three anti-prestin antibodies, was found all along the cochlear spiral in echolocating species. These ﬁndings provide morphological evidence that prestin can have a role in cochlear ampliﬁcation in the basolateral membrane up to 120–180 kHz. In addition, labeling of the cochlea with a combination of anti-prestin, anti-neuroﬁlament, anti-myosin VI and/or phalloidin and DAPI will be useful for detecting potential recent cases of noise-induced hearing loss in stranded cetaceans. This study improves our understanding of the mechanisms involved in sound transduction in echolocating mammals, as well as describing an optimized methodology for detecting cases of hearing loss in stranded marine mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "The expansion of oil palm agriculture has contributed to biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the tropics. Riparian reserves (areas of native forest along waterways) have the potential to maintain forest biodiversity and associated ecological processes within these agricultural landscapes. Using acoustic sampling, we investigated the value of riparian reserves for insectivorous bats in oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We compared general bat activity, foraging activity, and species occupancy between riparian areas in forest and riparian reserves in oil palm plantations. Overall bat activity varied little between riparian reserves in oil palm and riparian forest. Rather, activity was greatest in areas with a high forest canopy, irrespective of how much forest was available within or outside the riparian reserve. Bat foraging activity, as well as the occupancy of two species, was greatest in the forest sites, and while bats were detected in the oil palm riparian reserves, both foraging and occupancy were more associated with topographic ruggedness than forest amount or height. Our results indicate that habitat structure within riparian reserves may be more important than reserve size for supporting insectivorous bat diversity within oil palm landscapes. These ﬁndings provide important insights into the extent of the ecological beneﬁts provided by conservation set-asides in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics.",

Many of the studies examining the microbial community inhabiting bats have investigated bacterial taxa found within speciﬁc bat tissues and isolated bat guano pellets, but relatively few studies have explored bacterial diversity within bat guano piles. In large bat caves, bat guano can accumulate over time, creating piles several meters deep and forming complex interactions with coprophagous organisms in a habitat with low light and oxygen. As the guano decays, the nutrient composition changes, but the bacterial communities deep within the pile have not been characterized. Here, we assess the bacterial communities across varying depths within the guano pile using both culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. We found that although similar taxa are found throughout the guano pile, the relative abundances of taxa within the pile shift, allowing certain taxa to dominate the bacterial community at varying depths. We also identiﬁed potential bacterial functions being performed within the bat guano as various depths within the pile and found little variation in terms of the dominant predicted functions, suggesting that although the relative abundances of bacterial taxa are changing, the functions being performed are similar. Additionally, we cultured 15 different bacterial species, including 2 not present in our culture-independent analysis, and discuss the pathogenicity potential of these taxa. This study represents the ﬁrst characterization of the bacterial community from the extreme environment within a bat guano pile and demonstrates the potential for bat caves as resources for identifying new bacterial species.",

This is particularly necessary considering that chronic human disturbance is a threat to biodiversity worldwide. Depending on how species tolerate and adapt to such disturbance, ecological integrity and ecosystem services will be more or less affected. Bats are a species-rich and functionally diverse group, with important roles in ecosystems, and are therefore recognized as a good model group for assessing the impact of environmental change. Their populations have decreased in several regions, especially in the tropics, and are threatened by increasing human disturbance. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we assessed how the species-rich aerial insectivorous bats—essential for insect suppression services—respond to chronic human disturbance in the Caatinga dry forests of Brazil, an area potentially harboring ca. 100 bat species (nearly 50% are insectivorous), but with &gt; 60% its area composed of anthropogenic ecosystems under chronic pressure. Acoustic data for bat activity was collected at research sites with varying amounts of chronic human disturbance (e.g., livestock grazing and firewood gathering). The intensity of the disturbance is indicated by the global multi-metric CAD index (GMDI). Using Animal Sound Identifier (ASI) software, we identified 18 different bat taxon units. Using Hierarchical Modeling of Species Communities (HMSC), we found trends in the association of the disturbance gradient with species richness and bat activity: species richness was higher at sites with higher human disturbance, whereas bat activity decreased with increasing human disturbance. Additionally, we observed taxon-specific responses to human disturbance. We conclude that the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on the insectivorous bat fauna in the Caatinga are not homogeneous and a species-specific approach is necessary when assessing the responses of local bats to human disturbances in tropical dry forests, and in other biomes under human pressure.",

Among them, it is common for most bats species to emit distress, agonistic, appeasement and infant isolation calls. Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) are no different: They are gregarious animals living in colonies that can comprise hundreds of individuals. These bats live in North America and, typically found roosting in man-made structures like barns and attics, are considered common. They are insectivorous laryngeal echolocators, and while their calls and associated brain mechanisms in echolocation are well-documented, much less is known about their neural systems for analyzing social vocalizations. In this work we review what we know about the social lives of big brown bats and propose how to consolidate the nomenclature used to describe their social vocalizations. Furthermore, we discuss the next steps in the characterization of the social structure of this species and how these studies will advance both research in neuroethology and ecology of big brown bats.",

To investigate how free-ranging straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) ﬂy with changing wind support, we use data collected from bats ﬁt with GPS loggers and an integrated triaxial accelerometer and measure ﬂight speeds, wingbeat frequency, and overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as an estimate for energetic expenditure. We predicted that if ODBA reﬂects energetic expenditure, then we should ﬁnd a curvilinear relationship between ODBA and airspeed consistent with aerodynamic theory. We expected that bats would lower their airspeed with tailwind support and that ODBA will decrease with increasing tailwinds and increase with wingbeat frequency. We found that wingbeat frequency has the strongest positive relationship with ODBA. There was a small, but negative, relationship between airspeed and ODBA, and bats decreased ODBA with increasing tailwind. Bats ﬂew at ground speeds of 9.6 ± 2.4 ms−1 (Mean ± SD, range: 4.3–23.9 ms−1) and airspeeds of 10.2 ± 2.5 ms−1, and did not modify their wingbeat frequency with speed. Free-ranging straw-colored fruit bats therefore exerted more total ODBA in headwinds but not when they changed their airspeed. It is possible that the ﬂexibility in wingbeat kinematics may make ﬂight of free-ranging bats less costly than currently predicted or alternatively that the combination of ODBA and airspeed at our scales of measurement does not reﬂect this relationship in straw-colored fruit bats. Further work is needed to understand the full potential of free-ranging bat ﬂight and how well bio-logging techniques reﬂect the costs of bat ﬂight.",

            "abstractNote": "How multitrophic relationships between wildlife communities and their ectoparasitic vectors interact to shape the diversity of vector-borne microorganisms is poorly understood. Nested levels of dependence among microbes, vectors, and vertebrate hosts may have complicated effects on both microbial community assembly and evolution. We examined Bartonella sequences from European bats and their ectoparasites with a combination of network analysis, Bayesian phylogenetics, tipassociation and cophylogeny tests, and linear regression to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape parasite communities. We detected seven bat–ectoparasite–Bartonella communities that can be differentiated based on bat families and roosting patterns. Tips of the Bartonella tree were signiﬁcantly clustered by host taxonomy and geography. We also found signiﬁcant evidence of evolutionary congruence between bat host and Bartonella phylogenies, indicating that bacterial species have evolved to infect related bat species. Exploring these ecological and evolutionary associations further, we found that sharing of Bartonella species among bat hosts was strongly associated with host phylogenetic distance and roost sharing and less strongly with geographic range overlap. Ectoparasite sharing between hosts was strongly predicted by host phylogenetic distance, roost sharing, and geographic overlap but had no additive effect on Bartonella sharing. Finally, historical Bartonella host-switching was more frequent for closely related bats after accounting for sampling bias among bat species. This study helps to disentangle the complex ecology and evolution of Bartonella bacteria in bat species and their arthropod vectors. Our work provides insight into the important mechanisms that partition parasite communities among hosts, particularly the effect of host phylogeny and roost sharing, and could help to elucidate the evolutionary patterns of other diverse vector-borne microorganisms.",

In addition, two divergent clades have recently been described as separate species. One was named\n              Staphylococcus argenteus\n              , due to the lack of the “golden” pigment staphyloxanthin. The second one is\n              S. schweitzeri\n              , found in humans and animals from Central and West Africa. In late 2021, two additional species,\n              S. roterodami\n              and\n              S. singaporensis\n              , have been described from clinical samples from Southeast Asia. In the present study, isolates and their genome sequences from wild Straw-coloured fruit bats (\n              Eidolon helvum\n              ) and a Diamond firetail (\n              Stagonopleura guttata\n              , an estrildid finch) kept in a German aviary are described. The isolates possessed staphyloxanthin genes and were closer related to\n              S. argenteus\n              and\n              S. schweitzeri\n              than to\n              S. aureus\n              . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were nearly identical to both,\n              S. roterodami\n              and\n              S. singaporensis\n              . We propose considering the study isolates, the recently described\n              S. roterodami\n              and\n              S. singaporensis\n              as well as some Chinese strains with MLST profiles stored in the PubMLST database as different clonal complexes within one new species. According to the principle of priority we propose it should be named\n              S. roterodami\n              . This species is more widespread than previously believed, being observed in West Africa, Southeast Asia and Southern China. It has a zoonotic connection to bats and has been shown to be capable of causing skin and soft tissue infections in humans. It is positive for staphyloxanthin, and it could be mis-identified as\n              S. aureus\n              (or\n              S. argenteus\n              ) using routine procedures. However, it can be identified based on distinct MLST alleles, and “\n              S. aureus\n              ” sequence types ST2470, ST3135, ST3952, ST3960, ST3961, ST3963, ST3965, ST3980, ST4014, ST4075, ST4076, ST4185, ST4326, ST4569, ST6105, ST6106, ST6107, ST6108, ST6109, ST6999 and ST7342 belong to this species.",

The survey of the bat population was carried out by catching bats in nets, with the dominant species captured being M. daubentonii (37.0%), P. auritus (16.0%), M. mystacinus (11.4%), and M. nattereri (10.4%). Bats from the genera Eptesicus and Nyctalus were only caught on very rare occasions. The bat community found in caves consisted of seven species, mainly R. hipposideros (59.7%) and M. myotis (26.7%).",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat loss and fragmentation rank high amongst the most pressing threats to biodiversity. Understanding how variation in functional traits is associated with species vulnerability in fragmented landscapes is central to the design of effective conservation strategies. Here, we used a whole-ecosystem ecological experiment in the Central Amazon to investigate which functional traits of aerial-hawking insectivorous bats best predict their sensitivity to forest fragmentation. During 2014, bats were surveyed using passive bat recorders in six continuous forest sites, eight forest fragments, eight fragment edges, and eight forest clearings. The interaction between functional traits, environmental characteristics, and species distribution was investigated using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Our results showed that echolocation call structure, vertical stratiﬁcation, and wing aspect ratio were the strongest predictors of sensitivity to forest fragmentation. Frequency of maximum energy, body mass, and relative wing loading did not show any correlation with the environmental variables. Bat species with constant-frequency calls were associated with high vegetation density, being more susceptible to forest fragmentation than species with frequency-modulated calls. Vertical stratum preference was also correlated with vegetation structure, indicating that understory species were more sensitive to forest loss than canopy species. Finally, species with high aspect ratio wings were linked to forest edges and clearings. Our ﬁndings suggest that species functional traits determine the vulnerability of aerialhawking insectivorous bats toward fragmentation and, similarly, environmental conditions determine if a species is likely to become locally extinct due to fragmentation. Preserving structurally complex forests will be crucial to ensure the long-term persistence of the most sensitive and vulnerable species of this bat ensemble in fragmented landscapes across the Neotropics.",

Successful orientation in a complex environment depends on auditory information processing, along with adaptive vocal-motor behaviors and flight path control, which draw upon 3-D spatial perception, attention, and memory.This article reviews field and laboratory studies that document adaptive sonar behaviors of echolocating bats, and point to the fundamental signal parameters they use to track and sort auditory objects in a dynamic environment. We suggest that adaptive sonar behavior provides a window to bats’ perception of complex auditory scenes.",

            "abstractNote": "The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), a species that is federally endangered in the U.S., is being impacted by white-nose syndrome and habitat loss across much of its range. A better understanding of summer roost ecology of the species will enable us to develop management strategies that promote summer survival for breeding adult females and their pups. We conducted a 5 year investigation of Indiana bat roost habitat selection and roosting behavior in a large (>250,000 ha) forested area of the southern Appalachian Mountains and compared our results to populations in different landscapes across the species’ range. From May to August 2008–2012, we attached radio transmitters to 50 adult females, 3 juveniles, and 7 adult males captured at sites on the Cherokee and Nantahala national forests and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We radiotracked bats to 95 roosts and measured characteristics of trees, 0.1 ha plots, and landscape attributes for 69 of these roosts and associated random trees. We used an AIC approach to compare 14 candidate conditional logistic regression models. The only plausible model, which carried 95% of total model weights, had 3 important terms. Indiana bats showed strong selection for yellow pine (Pinus subgenus Diploxylon) snags that were signiﬁcantly taller than random trees and in areas with a greater number of snags within 0.1 ha. During this study, tree and stand structure were more important for roost selection than larger scale factors and Indiana bats responded to a pulsed and highly ephemeral resource, dead yellow pines, which were a signiﬁcant component of the large forest tracts. Roosting behavior differed from what has been observed for Indiana bats in other parts of the eastern U.S.; maternity colonies tended to be smaller (<25 bats, but as large as 75 bats prior to pups being volant) and bats were more nomadic, using each roost tree for only 2–3 days on average and rarely for more than one year. The differences we observed in roosting behavior in the southern Appalachians suggest it would be wise to consider the broader landscape context when evaluating the roosting ecology of Indiana bats, as local forest types and disturbance events will affect stand structure and roost tree availability. Standand landscape-scale management practices that create or preserve large pine snags, such as prescribed ﬁre, coupled with natural or manmade pulsed disturbances, should aid in the management and recovery of the Indiana bat in this region.",

            "abstractNote": "The degree of spatial complexity in the environment, or clutter, affects the quality of foraging habitats for bats and their detection with acoustic systems. Clutter has been assessed in a variety of ways but there are no standardized methods for measuring clutter. We compared four methods (Visual Clutter, Cluster, Single Variable, and Clutter Index) and related these to the probability of detecting bat calls. From June to July, 2005–2006, we used Anabat detectors to conduct acoustic surveys for 2–4 nights at each of 71 points representing three visual clutter classes. We used a cluster analysis to identify groups of plots with similar characteristics. We used backwards stepwise discriminant analyses to identify important plot structure variables that differentiated among clutter classes and used discriminant analyses to test the effectiveness of the plot structure variables in classifying plots into visual clutter classes or clusters. Two clutter volume indices (Indexmax and Index15m) were computed for each plot by calculating the ratio of vegetation volume to available space in the plot. We assessed the effects of the clutter estimation methods on the probability of detecting bats in low and high frequency phonic groups. Occupancy rates ranged from 0.30 to 0.78 and probability of detecting any bat was P0.78 for each period; however, few identiﬁable calls were recorded. Live tree basal area, midstory live stem count, and canopy crown volume were the most effective measures of clutter for bats because each was a plausible predictor of bat detection and the former two were important for discriminating among plots with differing structure. The use of clutter indices has promise but such methods need to be tested prior to implementation. In future studies of bat foraging habitat, quantitative measures should be used to assess clutter so it is possible to make comparisons among habitats or studies.",

Historical rather than contemporary processes are often responsible for present patterns of species’ distribution, but their respective contributions are not always easy to disentangle. The strict forest specialist, sedentary, highly phylopatric Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii) is an ideal model species to assess the effect of historical landscape transformations in the current distribution patterns of forest species. Although to date the species has been considered almost absent from the Mediterranean range (Southern Europe), recently it has been shown to be common in certain spots there. We test whether the present distribution and ecological preferences of the species in this area are related to biogeographical constraints or to clearance of forests from preferred areas. We assessed roost selection, spatial ecology, foraging habitat selection, and prey selection in Atlantic and Mediterranean domains of the Iberian Peninsula. Ecological requirements appeared conserved throughout, but roost selection appeared less constrained in the Mediterranean localities. Hunting occurred preferentially inside closed deciduous oak forest in both regions, but commuting distances and foraging areas were larger in the Atlantic, together with higher habitat fragmentation and lower prey availability. The same prey taxa were eaten in both regions, although their frequency in the diet varied, matching differences in availability. Consequently, scarcity of these bats in Mediterranean Iberia seems to be better explained by the retreat or loss of deciduous forests due to human impacts, coupled with climate change.",

            "abstractNote": "For several decades, forest managers have considered the effects of logging on the habitat quality of forests for bats. Concern about bat activity above the canopy has now been raised owing to rapidly increasing demands for wind energy and the ensuing placement of wind turbines over forests. We investigated the little-explored vertical stratiﬁcation of bat activity in forests at ten sites on ten nights using ﬁve simultaneous bat-call recorders placed from near ground up to above the canopy. The vegetation-free space at each recorder position was measured with terrestrial laser scanning. We predicted that (1) the activity of Pipistrellus, nyctaloids and the open-habitat foraging guild will increase in mature forests with increasing height above ground, independent of local vegetation density and temperature, and (2) the activity of Myotis and the edge-habitat-foraging guild will decrease with height but increase with local low vegetation density. Our generalized linear mixed model indicated that nyctaloids, Pipistrellus and open-habitat foragers were increasingly active in higher strata, independent of temperature and local vegetation density. Activity of Myotis and Pipistrellus species and the edge-habitat foragers was higher along interior edges of forests. The activity of single species in the above-canopy stratum could be explained well by their Europe-wide wind-turbine risk assessment. Thus, we conclude that open-habitat bat species and Pipistrellus species not only forage regularly in clearings or forest meadows, but also above the canopy of closed mature stands, behaviour that may put them at risk from turbines.",

            "abstractNote": "As part of a bat ecology research effort in managed forests, we tracked seven lactating northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis Trouessart) to 12 roost trees used by maternity colonies ranging in size from 11 to 65 individuals in the central Appalachians of West Virginia. Lactating females switched among roosts on average every 5 days. Roosts were located in nine tree species, with 11 roosts in tree cavities and 1 under exfoliating bark. Eight of the roosts were located in snags; the other four were located in cavities in living trees. Black locust (Robinia pseudo-acacia L.) snags were selected as a roost sites more than expected based on their occurrence in the forests we surveyed. Only 3 of the 24 habitat characteristics differed between actual roost trees and randomly located cavity trees. Structurally, actual roosts tended to be closer to neighboring trees than did suitable roosts in randomly located cavity trees. Tree species was an important factor that inﬂuenced roost tree selection, with black locusts being used signiﬁcantly more than expected based on their abundance across the managed forest landscape we studied. All northern long-eared bat roosts were located in or below the forest canopy which suggests that solar exposure may not be as critical for selection of roost trees by maternity colonies of this species as opposed to other species of tree-roosting bat at more northern latitudes in North America. Although many previous studies have demonstrated the importance of oldgrowth habitat in providing roosting habitat for tree-roosting bats, use of roosting habitat and characteristics of roost sites have been little documented within intensively managed forests. Our research indicates that in managed, Allegheny hardwood–northern hardwood forests of the central Appalachians, short-lived, early successional species such as black locust may provide suitable roosting habitat for northern long-eared bats, as well as other species of bats.

Stationary ultrasound detectors were used to record ultrasound at various distances from the shores of lakes during the bats late pregnancy and lactation period. In this landscape, northern bat was the most commonly recorded species, followed by Myotis bats (pooled) and the soprano pipistrelle. None of the other European bat genera were present. There was a clear non-linear distribution pattern, with a steep increase in bat activity close to the shores. This is similar to what is found in fiords and thus could be a general pattern in landscapes with complex topography. Both climate and topography are factors likely to contribute to this pattern.",

We compared bat species richness and foraging activities between traditionally managed and unmanaged chestnut orchards, testing the hypothesis that managed orchards provide better foraging opportunities and harbour more bat species. Echolocation calls of foraging bats were sampled simultaneously at paired sites of managed and unmanaged orchards using custom made recorders. Vegetation structure and aerial insect availability were sampled at the recording sites and used as explanatory variables in the model. In a paired sampling design, we found twice the number of bat species (12) and ﬁve times higher total foraging activity in the managed chestnut orchards compared to the unmanaged ones. Bat species with low ﬂight manoeuvrability were 14 times more common in managed orchards, whereas bats with medium to high manoeuvrability were only 5 times more common than in abandoned orchards. The vegetation structure was less dense in managed orchards. However, management did not affect relative insect abundance. Bats primarily visited the most open orchards, free of undergrowth. As a result of restricted access into the overgrown forests, the abandonment of chestnut orchards leads to a decline in bat species richness and foraging activities. Continued management of chestnut orchards to maintain an open structure is important for the conservation of endangered bat species in the southern Swiss Alps.",

Such data are needed so that forest managers can make informed decisions regarding conservation of bat roosts. Our objective was to examine roost selection by nonreproductive eastern pipistrelles (Perimyotis subﬂavus) and red bats (Lasiurus borealis) in a dense deciduous forest undergoing low-intensity timber management in the southern Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, USA. During May to August 2004–2006, we radiotracked eight red bats and seven pipistrelles to roosts for 1–14 days (red bats, x¯ ¼ 4:11 days, n = 19 roosts; pipistrelles, x¯ ¼ 7 days, n = 15 roosts). We compared roost and random trees or points using paired-sample t-tests for tree and microhabitat characters and logistic regression models of one to three variables for macrohabitat characters. Neither red bats nor pipistrelles selected roosts based on tree or microhabitat characteristics. Red bats used a wide range of stand ages and conditions and, based on our most plausible models for macrohabitat variables, roosted closer than expected ðx¯ ¼ 70:6 mÞ to linear openings such as gated roads. Pipistrelles only used stands !72 years in age and roosted closer than expected ðx¯ ¼ 185:6 mÞ to nonlinear openings and at elevations lower than expected ðx¯ ¼ 882 mÞ. Combined evidence of multiple variables indicated that pipistrelles preferred to roost close to streams. Our results indicate that land managers in the southern Appalachians should maintain a diversity of age classes to provide roosting habitat for both species, and that pipistrelles in particular may beneﬁt from retention of mature stands or buffer zones near perennial streams. Furthermore, non-reproductive red bats and pipistrelles may prefer to roost near openings to minimize commuting costs when openings comprise a small proportion of a densely forested landscape.",

To explore roost site selection in late autumn and early winter at 62° N in western Norway, 18 bats of three genera of the Vespertilionidae family that are known to use underground hibernation sites were tagged with radio transmitters. The bats were tracked mostly during daytime between late September and up to early January. Mainly three habitats were used by bats in late autumn in this study; buildings, crevices in rock walls and rock scree. Roosts were distributed from sea level to the low alpine zone. Rock scree was confirmed as a hibernation site for bats.",

When combined with ﬂexible wing surfaces, the resulting unsteady ﬂuid ﬂows and interactions in ﬂapping ﬂight can be complex to describe, understand, and model. Here, a simple modiﬁed actuator disk is used in a quasi-steady description of the net aerodynamic lift forces on several species of bat whose wakes are measured with time-resolved PIV. The model appears to capture the timeaveraged and instantaneous lift forces on the wings and body, and could be used as basis for comparing ﬂapping ﬂight efﬁciency of different animal species and micro air vehicle designs.",

While Ornithodoros hasei seems to be abundant among foliage-roosting bats, other groups of ticks are found exclusively inside caves. In this paper, noteworthy records of soft ticks infesting bats are documented in new localities from Bahia, Pernambuco, Piauí, and Rondônia states. Out of 201 bats examined, 25 were infested by 152 ticks belonging to seven taxa: Ornithodoros cavernicolous, O. hasei, Ornithodoros marinkellei, Ornithodoros cf. fonsecai, Ornithodoros cf. clarki, Antricola sp., and Nothoaspis amazoniensis. These findings provide new insights into the geographical distribution and host association of soft ticks occurring in the Neotropical region. Remarkably, morphological and biological observations about O. hasei are inferred based on the examination of on-host-collected first stage nymphs.",

However, understanding of many aspects of the species’ biology is limited, due in part to the fairly recent recognition of E. floridanus as a distinct species rather than a subspecies of E. glaucinus. Through a two-year mark-recapture study of E. floridanus roosting in a group of bat houses, we obtained morphological measurements on .200 individuals. We documented modest male-biased sexual size dimorphism (forearm length, wing width, and wing length were larger in adult males than adult females) and found gular glands exclusively among males. If these morphological differences lead to niche partitioning between sexes, conservation planning may need to consider the foraging habitat use of males and females independently. Relative to other species in the genus Eumops, E. floridanus had a moderate aspect ratio index, low wing shape index, and low wing tip index, suggesting the species may not be capable of flying at speeds as fast as other closely related species, but may be more maneuverable and more efficient when flying in cluttered space.",

Four (Pmcyon lotor, Rattus rattus, R . norvegicus, Mus musculus) are regarded as introduced, three (Lonchorhina aurita, Glossophaga soricina, Lasionycteris noctivagans) are accidental, and two (Pteronotus parnellii, Momoops blainvillii) are known in the Bahamas only as fossils. Of the 14 indigenous and presumably breeding resident (or formerly resident) species, one ( Geocapromys ingrahami) is a rodent and the others are bats. G. ingrahami and three subspecies of bats (Natalus micropus tumidifrons, Eptesicus fuscus bahamensis, Tadarida brasiliensis bahamensis) are endemic to the Bahamas. A t least 12 of tne 14 resident species probably reached the Bahamas from the Greater Antilles, and the two others probably either from the Antilles or from continental North America. Cuba appears to have contributed more breeding resident species (at least six) than has any other potential source.",

            "abstractNote": "Ticks associated with bats have been poorly documented in the Neotropical Zoogeographical Region. In this study, a total of 1028 bats were sampled for tick infestations in the southern portion of the Brazilian Pantanal. A total of 368 ticks, morphologically identiﬁed as Ornithodoros hasei (n = 364) and O. mimon (n = 4), were collected from the following bat species: Artibeus planirostris, Platyrrhinus lineatus, Phyllostomus hastatus, Mimon crenulatum and Noctilio albiventris. Morphological identiﬁcation of O. hasei was conﬁrmed by molecular analysis. Regarding the most abundant bat species, only 40 (6.2 %) out of 650 A. planirostris were infested by O. hasei, with a mean intensity of 7.2 ticks per infested bat, or a mean abundance of 0.44 ticks per sampled bat. Noteworthy, one single P. hastatus was infested by 55 O. hasei larvae, in contrast to the 2.5–7.2 range of mean intensity values for the whole study. As a complement to the present study, a total of 8 museum bat specimens (6 Noctilio albiventris and 2 N. leporinus), collected in the northern region of Pantanal, were examined for tick infestations. These bats contained 176 ticks, which were all morphologically identiﬁed as O. hasei larvae. Mean intensity of infestation was 22, with a range of 1–46 ticks per infested bat. Our results suggest that A. planirostris might play an important role in the natural life cycle of O. hasei in the Pantanal.",

Results show that 16 species of plants grouped into eight families and classified in three categories of plant organs were exploited by these bats. Among them, three species of plants appeared for the first time in the diet of the frugivorous bats in Côte d’Ivoire. Fruit food resources were most abundant (83%) and fruits of Ficus genus were dominant (45%). The distribution of food resources varied with the season.",

Bats are hosts to a large number of ectoparasites, including ticks, which can act as vectors of zoonotic agents. For this reason, it is important to identify the distribution of ticks and their relationship to different hosts, including wild animals, bats in particular. The present research was conducted at 16 localities throughout Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). We examined 475 individuals of bats belonging to 13 species. A total of three tick species were identiﬁed, I. simplex being the most numerous and widespread, followed by I. vespertilionis and A. vespertilionis. To the best of our knowledge, the presented data include the ﬁrst records of I. simplex in Serbia and Montenegro, I. vespertilionis for Montenegro and A. vespertilionis in FYROM. Also, we identify a new possible host/parasite association between I. simplex and Rhinolophus euryale.",

            "abstractNote": "Background  The hyolaryngeal apparatus generates biosonar pulses in the laryngeally echolocating bats. The cartilage and muscles comprising the hyolarynx of laryngeally echolocating bats are morphologically modified compared to those of non-bat mammals, as represented by the hypertrophied intrinsic laryngeal muscle. Despite its crucial contribution to laryngeal echolocation, how the development of the hyolarynx in bats differs from that of other mammals is poorly documented. The genus Rhinolophus is one of the most sophisticated laryngeal echolocators, with the highest pulse frequency in bats. The present study provides the first detailed description of the three-dimensional anatomy and development of the skeleton, cartilage, muscle, and innervation patterns of the hyolaryngeal apparatus in two species of rhinolophid bats using micro-computed tomography images and serial tissue sections and compares them with those of laboratory mice. Furthermore, we measured the peak frequency of the echolocation pulse in active juvenile and adult individuals to correspond to echolocation pulses with hyolaryngeal morphology at each postnatal stage.\nResults  We found that the sagittal crests of the cricoid cartilage separated the dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle in horseshoe bats, indicating that this unique morphology may be required to reinforce the repeated closure movement of the glottis during biosonar pulse emission. We also found that the cricothyroid muscle is ventrally hypertrophied throughout ontogeny, and that the cranial laryngeal nerve has a novel branch supplying the hypertrophied region of this muscle. Our bioacoustic analyses revealed that the peak frequency shows negative allometry against skull growth, and that the volumetric growth of all laryngeal cartilages is correlated with the pulse peak frequency.\nConclusions  The unique patterns of muscle and innervation revealed in this study appear to have been obtained concomitantly with the acquisition of tracheal chambers in rhinolophids and hipposiderids, improving sound intensity during laryngeal echolocation. In addition, significant protrusion of the sagittal crest of the cricoid cartilage and the separated dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle may contribute to the sophisticated biosonar in this laryngeally echolocating lineage. Furthermore, our bioacoustic data suggested that the mineralization of these cartilages underpins",

            "abstractNote": "In many social animals, group members exchange information about where to feed. Thereby, they may gain direct beneﬁts, for example, if social hunting enhances individual foraging success. Alternatively, individuals may receive indirect ﬁtness beneﬁts by preferentially sharing information about suitable feeding sites with kin. Indeed, in some species, a positive correlation between the degree of relatedness among individuals and the overlap among their foraging areas was found. However, sharing foraging sites with kin can also have costs if it increases food competition, which is not compensated by direct beneﬁts. The goal of this study was to investigate whether sharing of individual foraging areas in female Bechstein’s bats is best explained by kin selection or by direct beneﬁts through social foraging. To assess their individual foraging behaviour, we analysed radio-tracking data of 22 members of one maternity colony, including nine mother–daughter pairs, seven pairs of less closely related individuals and six pairs of unrelated bats. We examined the bats’ ﬁdelity to speciﬁc foraging areas during several years and quantiﬁed the inﬂuence of kinship on the overlap among individual foraging areas. By measuring how close to each other the bats foraged, we assessed whether individuals with overlapping areas are likely to forage together. Our study conﬁrms previous ﬁndings that Bechstein’s bats show high ﬁdelity to foraging areas across years. Moreover, we found that relatives share foraging areas significantly more often compared with unrelated colony members. Finally, our data reveal for the ﬁrst time that most colony members that share foraging areas are unlikely to forage together. This suggests that female Bechstein’s bats gain no direct beneﬁts from sharing foraging areas with members of the same maternal lineage. Our ﬁndings also have implications for conservation as habitat loss within a colony’s home range might expose entire matrilines to high risks.",

In this context, bats have been used to indicate environmental contaminants in urban and agricultural environments, since they are extremely sensitive to changes in the ecosystem and easily accumulate waste in their body tissues. Among bats, Sturnira lilium, is a frugivorous species widely distributed and abundant in Brazil that uses an extensive variety of habitats and shelters. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the oxidative state of S. lilium individuals in agricultural and urban areas in southern Brazil. Individuals were sampled in agricultural and urban areas from November 2017 to March 2018 through the mist-net method. Parameters of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activity, non-protein thiols (NPSH), and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) were determined based on liver tissue. A total of 46 individuals were captured, 29 of them in urban areas and 17 in agricultural areas. We found that S. lilium individuals from agricultural areas showed a significant increase in TBARS, NPSH, and SOD activity, compared to individuals from urban areas. The activity of the antioxidant enzyme CAT did not differ. The present findings suggest that the species S. lilium, which are widely distributed and abundant in Brazil in urban and agricultural areas, can usefully be employed in biomonitoring programs. Further studies are to be encouraged to refine our knowledge on the potential DNA damage caused by environmental contamination, as well as identify potential contaminants to bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are poorly understood as a reservoir of multidrug-resistant strains; therefore, the aim of this study was to determine molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus strains isolated from bat species from Poland. A multi-stage analysis based on targeted isolation of drug-resistant strains (selective media with tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin), determination of the phenotypic proﬁle of drug-susceptibility using the disc diffusion method, and ampliﬁcation of DNA fragments surrounding rare restriction sites (ADSRRS-ﬁngerprinting) was used for the isolation and differentiation of strains. The applied strategy ﬁnally allowed identiﬁcation of E. faecalis resistant to at least one antimicrobial in 47.2% of the single-animal group and in 46.9% of the pooled samples of bat’s guano. Out of the 36 distinct isolates, 69% met the criteria of multi-drug resistance, with a dominant combination of resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, and rifampicin. Simultaneously, 41.6% of the strains were high-level aminoglycoside resistant (HLAR). In most strains, phenotypic resistance was reﬂected in the presence of at least one gene encoding resistance to a given drug. Moreover, our research results show that some genes were detected simultaneously in the same strain statistically signiﬁcantly more frequently. This may conﬁrm that the spread of some genes (tetM and ermB or aph (30)-IIIa as well as gelE and aac (60)-Ie-aph (200)-Ia or ant (6)-Ia) is associated with their common occurrence on the same mobile genetic element.",

            "abstractNote": "There is a growing conservation concern about the possible consequences of environmental contamination in the health of bat communities. Most studies on the effects of contaminants in bats have been focused on organic contaminants, and the consequences of bat exposure to metals and metalloids remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of external biological matrices (fur and wing membrane) for the assessment of exposure and bioaccumulation of metals in bats. The concentration of arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, nickel, lead, selenium and zinc was measured in internal organs (liver, heart, brain), internal (bone) and external tissues (wing membrane, fur) collected from bat carcasses of four species (Hypsugo savii, Nyctalus leisleri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus) obtained in windfarm mortality searches. With the exception of zinc (P ¼ 0.223), the results showed signiﬁcant differences between the concentrations of metals in the analyzed tissues for all metals (P < 0.05). Signiﬁcant differences were also found between organs/tissues (P < 0.001), metals (P < 0.001) and a signiﬁcant interaction between organs/tissues and metals was found (P < 0.001). Despite these results, the patterns in terms of metal accumulation were similar for all samples. Depending on the metal, the organ/tissue that showed the highest concentrations varied, but fur and wing had the highest concentrations for most metals. The variability obtained in terms of metal concentrations in different tissues highlights the need to deﬁne standardized methods capable of being applied in monitoring bat populations worldwide. The results indicate that wing membrane and fur, biological matrices that may be collected from living bats, yield reliable results and may be useful for studies on bats ecotoxicology, coupled to a standardized protocol for large-scale investigation of metal accumulation.",

The beginning of the sequence (AD 990) was rather wet for more than a century, before becoming progressively drier. After a brief, yet distinct wet period around AD 1170, drier conditions, with a possible shift from C3 to a mixed C3-dominated/C4 type vegetation (2 ‰ lower δ13C values), prevailed for almost half a century before the climate became colder and wetter at the onset of the Little Ice Age, when bats left the cave. The guano-inferred wet and dry intervals from the GM Cave are mirrored by changes in the color and amount of clay accumulated in the cave. They also agree well with reconstructions based on pollen and charcoal from peat bogs and δ13C and δ18O on speleothems from other Romanian sites. Overall, these results indicate that the δ13C of bat guano can provide a sensitive record of the shortterm coupling between local/regional climate and the plant–insect–bat–guano system.",

Within the oceans, coral reef systems have been facing unprecedented mass bleaching episodes, sea turtles worldwide are currently experiencing an epidemic in the form of ﬁbropapilloma, and global phytoplankton populations have declined by 40%. Within the Earth's terrestrial systems, similar phenomena have appeared in the form of colony collapse disorder (CCD) currently devastating honey bee colonies, White Nose Syndrome decimating bat populations, and the chytrid fungus plaguing amphibian populations. On the surface these events appear to be unrelated yet at the root of each phenomenon there appears an underlying threat — pollution. This paper will investigate the commonality of these occurrences as well as investigate the current and potential solutions to the threat.",
