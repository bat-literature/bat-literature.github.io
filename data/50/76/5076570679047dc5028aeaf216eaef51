            "abstractNote": "The site of El Portalón is the entrance to the Cueva Mayor karst system, located in the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos, Spain). This is an important Holocene archaeological site, which was excavated in the 1970s but from which little has been published. New excavations starting in 2000 have highlighted a deep stratigraphical sequence, with human occupations starting at the end of the Late Pleistocene. In this paper, we present for the ﬁrst time, on the basis of the small-vertebrate assemblage, palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions of the Latest Pleistocene of the Sierra de Atapuerca, well known for its Early to Middle Pleistocene human-bearing localities. The small vertebrates of El Portalón comprise at least 25 species: 4 amphibians (Alytes obstetricans, Bufo bufo, Bufo calamita and Rana temporaria); 3 squamates (an indeterminate small-size lacertid, an indeterminate large colubrine and Vipera sp.); 6 insectivores (Sorex gr. coronatus-araneus, Sorex minutus, Neomys fodiens, Neomys anomalus, Talpa europaea and Galemys pyrenaicus); 2 bats (Myotis myotis and Myotis gr. myotis-blythi); 10 rodents (Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis, Microtus oeconomus, Iberomys cabrerae, Chionomys nivalis, Terricola duodecimcostatus, Arvicola sapidus, Arvicola terrestris, Apodemus sylvaticus and Eliomys quercinus). These taxa, many of which are ecothermal (sensitive to temperature) show variations in their taxonomic diversity throughout the sequence. Although, with the exception of M. oeconomus, they do not differ from the extant fauna of the Iberian Peninsula, they do so in the abundance of their taxonomic assemblage. When the small vertebrates are grouped and studied in terms of vertical trends through the sequence, it is possible to follow environmental and climatic changes. Results from the small-vertebrate associations indicate that the landscape had open habitats in the vicinity of the Atapuerca caves throughout the sequence, with wet locales in the surrounding area. Woodland and water stream meadows were more developed during “warm” periods (Is5, Is6/Is7 and Is3/Is4), whereas during “cold” periods (H3 and LGM) the environment was slightly more humid in response to winter precipitation and the opening of the landscape. These results are compared with pollen analysis and marine isotopic curves, giving a scenario for the palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental changes that occurred during the Latest Pleistocene in the Sierra de Atapuerca.",

It was in this context of rapid ﬂuctuations that the terrestrial sequence of Caverne Marie-Jeanne (Hastière-Lavaux, Belgium) in northwestern Europe was formed. The habitat weighting method and the bioclimatic model, as well as the Simpson diversity index, are applied to the small-mammal assemblage of Caverne Marie-Jeanne in order to reconstruct the environmental and climatic ﬂuctuations that are reﬂected in the MIS 3 sequence of the cave. Revision of the small-mammal fossil material deposited in the collections of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS, Brussels, Belgium) shows that the lower layers (6 to 4) of the cave, pertaining to MIS 3 (ca. 50–40 ka), underwent cold, dry environmental and climatic conditions for these layers. This is indicated by temperatures lower than at present and precipitation slightly higher than at present, together with an environment dominated by open woodland formations and open dry meadows. Our results are consistent with the available chronological, large-mammal, herpetofaunal and mollusc datasets for this lower part of the sequence. They are also consistent with regional loess studies in Belgium and with previous work performed on small mammals from MIS 3 in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe.",

            "abstractNote": "Natural wildlife habitats are regularly encroached by humans for different purposes, which are heading the biodiversity towards dramatic falls. The presence of several endangered species in many areas remains unveiled due to the lack of faunal inventories. In such situations, it is imperative to make proper records of the existing fauna on local scales to strengthen the conservation practices. Twentyone species representing 18 genera, 12 families and six orders of mammals were recorded in Nowshera district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (KP), Pakistan from an inventory conducted from November 2018 to July 2019. Selected locations were scanned by walking and grey literature was used. Five of the recorded species were found in captive breeding facilities while rest of the species were recorded exclusively from the wild. Order Artiodactyla was the most diverse group represented by 7 species from 5 genera in 3 families. Critically endangered Common leopard Panthera pardus an imperceptible resident species of the area was revealed for the first time by using grey literature. Wild boar Sus scrofa was the most dominant and frequently occurring species of the area. Based on the regional conservation status of the recorded species, 3 species are near threatened, 2 species are vulnerable, one endangered and one species is critically endangered. Four species are protected under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife and Biodiversity (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Act, 2015. Threats being faced by the reported mammalian fauna from human activities are emphasized.",

Of the recorded species, 2 were primates, 10 rodents, 1 lagomorph (hare), 5 chiropterans (bats), 1 manid, 7 carnivores and 3 ungulates. Rodentia appeared as the largest family contained 10 speices. The overall mammalian population density was 239.12/km2. Irrawardy squirrel (Callosciurus pygerythrus) scored the highest density (112.97/km2) and several species attained the lowest (1/km2 each). Local status (relative abundance) of mammals assessed where 15 (51.72%) species were rare, and according to National Conservation Status, 13 (44.82%) were remarked as threatened species of that area. There were some major threats to the park such as forest fire, encroachment of forest and forest edges by both tribal and landless people, illegal exploitation of forest resources, grazing of livestock and unavailable water reservoirs.",

            "abstractNote": "Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have a long‐standing interest in the patterns and causes of geographical variation in animals’ acoustic signals. Nonetheless, the processes driving acoustic divergence are still poorly understood. Here, we studied the geographical variation in echolocation vocalizations (commonly referred to as echolocation ‘pulses’ given their short duration and relatively stereotypic nature, and to contrast them from the communicative vocalizations or ‘calls’) of a widespread bat species\n              Hipposideros armiger\n              in south China, and assessed whether the acoustic divergence was driven by either ecological selection, or cultural or genetic drift. Our results revealed that the peak frequency of echolocation pulses varied significantly across populations sampled, with the maximum variation of about 6 kHz. The peak frequency clustered into three groups: eastern and western China, Hainan and southern Yunnan. The population differences in echolocation pulses were not significantly related to the variation in climatic (mean annual temperature, mean annual relative humidity, and mean annual precipitable water) or genetic (genetic distance) factors, but significantly related to morphological (forearm length) variation which was correlated with mean annual temperature. Moreover, the acoustic differences were significantly correlated with geographical and latitudinal distance after controlling for ‘morphological distance’. Thus, neither direct ecological selection nor genetic drift contributed to the acoustic divergence observed in\n              H. armiger\n              . Instead, we propose that the action of both indirect ecological selection (i.e. selection on body size) as well as cultural drift promote, in part, divergence in echolocation vocalizations of individuals within geographically distributed populations.",

Relevant cognitive processes such as associative learning and spatial memory have commonly been studied in a foraging related context under controlled laboratory conditions. However, in natural environments, animals can use multiple cognitive processes to localize resources. In this field study, we used a pairwise choice experiment and automatic roost monitoring to assess how individually marked, free-ranging Bechstein’s bats belonging to two different colonies use associative learning, spatial memory and social information when localizing suitable day roosts. To our knowledge, this study tests for the first time how associative learning, spatial memory and social information are used in the process of roost localization in bats under the natural conditions. We show that, when searching for new roosts, bats used associative learning to discriminate between suitable and unsuitable roosts. For re-localizing previously occupied roosts, bats used spatial memory rather than associative learning. Moreover, bats significantly improved the localization of suitable unfamiliar roosts and tended to increase their accuracy to re-localize previously occupied day roosts using social information. Our field experiments suggest that Bechstein’s bats make hierarchical use of different cognitive processes when localizing day roosts. More generally, our study underlines that evaluating different cues under natural conditions is fundamental to understanding how natural selection has shaped the cognitive processes used for localizing resources.",

            "abstractNote": "Harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during metabolism and immune responses are neutralized in part by a powerful enzymatic antioxidant system. Inter-species variability in the baseline activity of antioxidant enzymes may be explained by a variety of life history traits. For instance, ectoparasites can elicit repeated immune responses, thus increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. The bat species studied so far have been acknowledged to have effective antioxidant defences. However, interspecific comparisons within the clade do not exist. The present study compares the antioxidant defence and immune function activities in five northern boreal bat species relative to their ectoparasite prevalence and intensity (wing mites and louse flies) to reveal inter-species differences. Antioxidant enzyme and immune defense activities, which differ between species, are positively associated, with total ectoparasite (mites and bat flies) frequencies, total ROS, and protein carbonylation in Daubenton’s bats, but enzyme activities are also independently influenced by sampling date with activities increasing towards the autumn. Antioxidant activities are also positively associated with total reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage (protein carbonylation) in the Daubenton’s bat. Our results suggest that antioxidant activities are associated with ecological factors such as parasite load and season, and we consider it likely that these may partly explain the observed interspecific variation.",

            "abstractNote": "At northern latitudes, bats often use roosting structures provided by people. Conventional thinking suggests that bat boxes should be entirely black to absorb heat and assist bats with thermoregulation. However, with long periods of summer daylight in subarctic Canada, we suspected that risk of overheating might occur in black boxes. We investigated whether roost temperatures exceeded 428C, the upper limit of the thermoneutral zone in Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus), and whether replacing the black roof with a white one, akin to a sun hat, would alleviate the risk of overheating without compromising roost temperatures especially at night. We also investigated whether bats used the boxes. The internal temperature of black boxes exceeded 428C on some days in 2 summers. Substituting the black roof with a white one consistently reduced the maximum daily roost temperature to below 428C, but this was also accompanied by a slightly lower minimum roost temperature at night and a cooler roost temperature regime overall. The reduction in maximum daily roost temperature by the white roof was more pronounced on days with higher maximum daily ambient temperatures. At 5 sites with paired white-roof and black-roof boxes, 4 had bat use of both boxes and 1 had no use of either box. Bats used 10 of 19 (53%) black-roof boxes in 2019, and 16 of 21 (77%) in 2020. Replacing a black roof with a white one can mitigate risk of overheating for boxes in subarctic latitudes, and likely through a range of temperate latitudes. However, completely black boxes are still necessary to enhance the thermal environment for roosting bats through most of the summer. We suggest that providing bats with roosting options, such as paired black-roof and white-roof boxes immediately adjacent to one another, is a better habitat enhancement option than just single black boxes.",

We quantified rates of mortality at a wind energy facility in Manitoba, Canada by conducting standardized carcass searches corrected for searcher efficiency and scavenging from mid-August to mid-September 2007. We found that mortality was consistent with, but qualitatively higher than that at comparable wind facilities in western Canada. Mortality of the species most commonly killed, Silver-haired Bats, was evenly distributed across the wind facility, but mortality of Hoary and Eastern Red Bats was higher at some turbines than others.",

Cain in coastal British Columbia during 1996–1998. We analyzed their feces and determined the percent frequency of occurrence of different prey groups. Bats consumed prey from 9 prey groups. Diets varied signiﬁcantly between M. californicus and M. lucifugus, but there was substantial overlap of the principal prey groups consumed by all species of bats. These principal prey groups were Diptera, Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, and Hymenoptera. Diets were similar between elevations and among seasons for both M. californicus and M. lucifugus.",

Across all years and sites, Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown Bat) was the most frequently captured bat (59.6% of all captures). We captured over 78% (n = 1106) of bats within the first 120 min after sunset. Based on the capture of lactating females, the following species raise young in southwest Wisconsin: Eptesicus fuscus (Big Brown Bat), Perimyotis subflavus (Tri-colored Bat), Little Brown Bat, M. septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat), Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red Bat), and L. cinereus (Hoary Bat). Secondary sexual dimorphism was most evident in Big Brown Bats and Eastern Red Bats. Trends at 1 primary research site for the 3 most commonly captured species showed that, from 2007 to 2017, there was no significant change in number of bats captured per mist-net-meter-hour for Big Brown Bats and Eastern Red Bats. In contrast, and coincident with the occurrence of white-nose syndrome in Wisconsin, there was a signicant decline in the number of Little Brown Bats captured per mist-net-meterhour over that same time period. Monitoring of bat populations in southwest Wisconsin should continue.",

Few studies have examined Eastern Small-footed Myotis migration and roosting behavior. Until a recent discovery of a population of Eastern Small-footed Myotis using an abandoned railroad tunnel in western Maryland, most observations from the state were limited to records of a few individuals at scattered caves, mines, and tunnels. We used harp traps to capture Eastern Small-footed Myotis at an abandoned railroad tunnel located in Allegany County, in spring 2007. We captured 47 Eastern Small-footed Myotis and equipped four females with radio transmitters. Telemetry revealed that female Eastern Small-footed Myotis migrated ≤1.1 km to nearby shale barrens and roosted in rock outcrops of various sizes during spring. Females moved <50 m between successive diurnal roosts, which did not differ from random sites located within the shale barrens in terms of site characteristics. Migratory distances and, consequently, geographic ranges of female Eastern Smallfooted Myotis probably are inﬂuenced by the availability of hibernacula and roosting sites across the landscape.",

            "abstractNote": "Roads and associated land transport activities can affect a wide range of indigenous terrestrial vertebrate species. National legislation, particularly the Resource Management Act 1991, requires that developers ‘avoid, remedy or mitigate’ the adverse environmental effects of their activities. How these effects are identified and managed in New Zealand varies because regulators and land transport contractors deal with these issues on a case-by-case basis. In recent years, the effects of new road projects on long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) have been receiving attention. In this review, we summarise evidence on likely road infrastructure impacts on bat populations and the efficacy of mitigation approaches, used both internationally and in New Zealand. Our findings indicate that most mitigation methods have little, if any, scientific evidence of their effectiveness. We recommend that such evidence is essential to guide investment in mitigating road effects on bats in New Zealand. Given that such evidence is rare, future investment should be guided by an adaptive management framework that is justified by strong, inferential, evidence-based logic, and accompanied by robust, appropriately designed monitoring planned, in advance, to allow an objective assessment of a method’s effectiveness in mitigating an impact. Because such monitoring may be beyond what a single development project can realistically achieve, we suggest the development of a collaborative funding model for supporting the testing and development of mitigation methods. This work is likely to have a significant influence on the future planning and design of road infrastructure projects to minimise the impacts on bats and, more generally, on any native wildlife populations under threat from infrastructure development.",

Vocalizations uttered during babbling resemble, to some degree, the acoustic structure of adult vocalizations and are often produced in long bouts independent of any social context. Similar behavior, termed subsong or plastic song, is known from a variety of songbirds. Here, we show that pups of the sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata), a species with an unusually large vocal repertoire, produce renditions of all known adult vocalization types during bouts of vocalizations, which appear to be independent of a distinct social context. Babbling occurs in pups of both sexes, even though only adult males, not females, utter all different vocalization types produced in infancy. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of babbling in a nonprimate mammal and suggests that infant babbling may be necessary for the ontogeny of complex vocal repertoires.",

            "abstractNote": "The article presents the comparative analysis of the helminth fauna of the sympatric bat species, Myotis mystacinus and M. brandtii (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae), in the Samarskaya Luka National Park (Russia). Twelve species of parasites were recorded in both bat species in 2005–2007, including nine species of Trematoda, one species of Cestoda, and two species of Nematoda. All of these 12 species were noted in M. brandtii. The helminth fauna of M. mystacinus included a slightly depleted parasite fauna of M. brandtii being represented by seven species of parasites found in M. mystacinus, including six species of Trematoda and one species of Cestoda. The helminth fauna of both bat species has a moderate level of the fauna similarity. Differences in the infection level of the two bat species are found in both number of helminth species and quantitative rates of the helminth fauna. Helminth infection of M. brandtii is significantly higher than of M. mystacinus. The helminth fauna of M. mystacinus and M. brandtii is driven by the bat lifestyle and diet. Both bat species are being infected by helminths through food items. The broader diet composition of M. brandtii and its feeding on a wider number of insect groups increases the infection probability of this bat species by rare and accidental parasites, and it also increases the infection rates by obligate species of trematodes. Therefore, M. brandtii has a more diverse helminth fauna and a higher number of abundant parasite species as well. The diet of M. mystacinus contains a limited number of food items. This reduces the probability of its infection by several helminth species and, on the other hand, it causes a relatively high infection rates for some trematode species. The similarity of helminth faunas of M. brandtii and M. mystacinus is caused by the use of the same feeding habitats and the similarity of their diet. The obtained data confirm the partial overlap of spatial and trophic niches of the two studied bat species.",

In addition, bats have a low incidence of cancer, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here we discovered that bat cells are more resistant than human and mouse cells to DNA damage induced by genotoxic drugs. We found that bat cells accumulate less chemical than human and mouse cells, and efficient drug efflux mediated by the ABC transporter ABCB1 underlies this improved response to genotoxic reagents. Inhibition of ABCB1 triggers an accumulation of doxorubicin, DNA damage, and cell death. ABCB1 is expressed at higher levels in several cell lines and tissues derived from bats compared to humans. Furthermore, increased drug efflux and high expression of ABCB1 are conserved across multiple bat species. Our findings suggest that enhanced efflux protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds, which may contribute to their low cancer incidence.",

Bats were observed at their roosts and feeding grounds. 5 nursery colonies were found in churches and castles. 3 belonged to the lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros, 1 to the serotine Eptesicus serotinus and 1 to the greater mouse-eared bat Myotis myotis. The disappearance of the latter two nursery colonies on account of roof renovation is documented. Some ecological data are also mentioned, including an interesting observation of Aesculapian snake Elaphe longissima in the nursery of the lesser horseshoe bat. The possibility of predation can not be excluded. At the end some recommendations for bat conservation are given.",

Bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) are among the most speciose mammals on the planet and the only mammal capable of true ﬂight. We examined 1,236 16S rRNA amplicon libraries of the gut, oral, and skin microbiota from 497 Afrotropical bats (representing 9 families, 20 genera, and 31 species) to assess the extent to which host ecology and phylogeny predict microbial community similarity in bats. In contrast to recent studies of host-microbe associations in other mammals, we found no correlation between chiropteran phylogeny and bacterial community dissimilarity across the three anatomical sites sampled. For all anatomical sites, we found host species identity and geographic locality to be strong predictors of microbial community composition and observed a positive correlation between elevation and bacterial richness. Last, we identiﬁed signiﬁcantly different bacterial associations within the gut microbiota of insectivorous and frugivorous bats. We conclude that the gut, oral, and skin microbiota of bats are shaped predominantly by ecological factors and do not exhibit the same degree of phylosymbiosis observed in other mammals.",

(mSphere 1[1]:e00070-15, 2016, 10.1128/ mSphere.00070-15) report the identiﬁcation of a novel gammaherpesvirus in a cell line derived from the microbat Myotis velifer incautus. This is the ﬁrst report on a replicating, infectious gammaherpesvirus from bats. The new virus is named bat gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8), also known as Myotis gammaherpesvirus 8, and is able to infect multiple cell lines, including those of human origin. Using nextgeneration sequencing technology, the authors constructed a full-length annotated genomic map of BGHV8. Phylogenetic analysis of several genes from BGHV8 revealed similarity to several mammalian gammaherpesviruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).",

The aim of this study was to test if and how individual bats in a Stunira lilium population differ in their movement activity and preferences for landscape features in a correlated manner.\nMethods: We collected data on movements of 27 individuals using radio telemetry. We fitted a heterogeneousspace diffusion model to the movement data in order to evaluate signals of movement variation among individuals.\nResults: S. lilium individuals generally preferred open habitat with Solanum fruits, regularly switched between forest and open areas, and showed high site fidelity. Movement variation among individuals could be summarized in four movement syndromes: (1) average individuals, (2) forest specialists, (3) explorers which prefer Piper, and (4) open area specialists which prefer Solanum and Cecropia.\nConclusions: Individual preferences for landscape features plus food resource and movement activity were correlated, resulting in different movement syndromes. Individual variation in preferences for landscape elements and food resources highlight the importance of incorporating explicitly the interaction between landscape structure and individual heterogeneity in descriptions of animal movement.",

The relationships among ferungulates that have high quality draft genome sequences available (i.e. dog, cow, horse) are unresolved, and thus we examined their phylogeny using currently known mammalian 1:1 orthologs. This dataset consists of 40 million base pairs from 2705 protein-coding genes. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of the combined and individual gene phylogenies strongly support a sister grouping of cow and horse to the exclusion of dog although topology tests could not rule out a horse and dog sister group relationship.",

            "abstractNote": "Nuclear DNA intron sequences are increasingly used to investigate evolutionary relationships among closely related organisms. The phylogenetic usefulness of intron sequences at higher taxonomic levels has, however, not been Wrmly established and very few studies have used these markers to address evolutionary questions above the family level. In addition, the mechanisms driving intron evolution are not well understood. We compared DNA sequence data derived from three presumably independently segregating introns (THY, PRKC I and MGF) across 158 mammalian species. All currently recognized extant eutherian mammalian orders were included with the exception of Cingulata, Dermoptera and Scandentia. The total aligned length of the data was 6366 base pairs (bp); after the exclusion of autapomorphic insertions, 1511 bp were analyzed. In many instances the Bayesian and parsimony analyses were complementary and gave signiWcant posterior probability and bootstrap support (>80) for the monophyly of Afrotheria, Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria and Boreoeutheria. Apart from Wnding congruent support when using these methods, the intron data also provided several indels longer than 3 bp that support, among others, the monophyly of Afrotheria, Paenungulata, Ferae and Boreoeutheria. A quantitative analysis of insertions and deletions suggested that there was a 75% bias towards deletions. The average insertion size in the mammalian data set was 16.49 bp § 57.70 while the average deletion was much smaller (4.47 bp § 14.17). The tendency towards large insertions and small deletions is highlighted by the observation that out of a total of 17 indels larger than 100 bp, 15 were insertions. The majority of indels (>60% of all events) were 1 or 2 bp changes. Although the average overall indel substitution rate of 0.00559 per site is comparable to that previously reported for rodents and primates, individual analyses among diVerent evolutionary lineages provide evidence for diVerences in the formation rate of indels among the diVerent mammalian groups.",

To reconstruct the history of the species complex and explain the codistribution of both forms in Europe and the Mediterranean, we performed phylogenetic analysis based on a 402-bp portion of the cytochrome b gene. Particular attention was paid to the eastern and southern parts of the range where no data were available. We found further distinctive allopatric haplotypes from Libya and Morocco. The diﬀerence of about 6–7% described in the Libyan population suggests the occurrence of a new species in the southern Mediterranean. The species status of Moroccan population is also discussed. The phylogeographic patterns obtained and analysis of fossil records support the hypothesis of expansion of both species into Europe from the Mediterranean region during the Holocene. The allopatric speciation model ﬁts our data best. The paleobiographic scenario envisaged is corroborated also by molecular clock estimations and correlations with Late Neogene environmental changes in the Mediterranean region which ended with the Messinian salinity crisis.",

Various approaches exist to help prioritize species and populations for conservation. Past efforts have often used relatively narrow, one‐dimensional criteria, such as genetic resource value or exposure to threats. What is lacking is a refined, comprehensive prioritization approach including ecological and evolutionary aspects, informed by rich and reliable data. In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Razgour et al. (\n              \n              ) present a new prioritization framework that coherently integrates three dimensions of population vulnerability: exposure to change, sensitivity to change and range shift potential. They measure these dimensions for 10 populations of a European bat using a suite of advanced analysis methods that leverage genomic, environmental and occurrence data. Explicitly recognizing and quantifying the multidimensional nature of conservation priorities is a key advance because it enables a nuanced assessment of each population and identification of populations of high concern along all three dimensions. With some caveats and modifications, this framework could be a major step for conservation prioritization and intervention that is proactive and informed by evolutionary principles.",

The potential of new methods for developing conserved microsatellite markers that possess enhanced cross-species utility has recently been illustrated in studies of birds. We have applied these methods to develop enhanced microsatellite markers for vespertilionid bats, in particular for the genus Myotis (103 species). We compared published bat microsatellites with their homologues in the genome sequence of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, to create consensus sequences that were used to design candidate primer sets. Primer sets were then tested for ampliﬁcation and polymorphism in 22 species of bat from nine of the largest families (including 11 Vespertilionidae). Of 46 loci tested, 33 were polymorphic, on average, in each of seven Myotis species tested, 20 in each of four species in other vespertilionid genera, and two in 11 nonvespertilionid species.",

Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a portion of the introns within the zinc-ﬁnger-X (Zfx) and zinc-ﬁnger-Y (Zfy) genes. We designed primers to produce size variation between the Zfx and Zfy products that could be visualized using gel electrophoresis. Using an example from our wind-wildlife research, we show how sex data generated using this method are superior to sex data based on external morphology. Our method allows for the generation of sex data across a wide range of bats that can be used to address key questions in wildlife forensics, behavioural ecology, conservation and evolutionary biology.",

            "abstractNote": "Predator–­prey interactions are important but difficult to study in the field. Therefore, laboratory studies are often used to examine the outcomes of predator–­prey interactions. Previous laboratory studies have shown that moth hearing and ultrasound production can help prey avoid being eaten by bats. We report here that laboratory behavioural outcomes may not accurately reflect the outcomes of field bat–­moth interactions. We tested the success rates of two bat species capturing moths with distinct anti-­bat tactics using behavioural experiments. We compared the results with the dietary composition of field bats using next-g­ eneration DNA sequencing. Rhinolophus episcopus and Rhinolophus osgoodi had a lower rate of capture success when hunting for moths that produce anti-b­ at clicks than for silent eared moths and earless moths. Unexpectedly, the success rates of the bats capturing silent eared moths and earless moths did not differ significantly from each other. However, the field bats had a higher proportion of silent eared moths than that of earless moths and that of clicking moths in their diets. The difference between the proportions of silent eared moths and earless moths in the bat diets can be explained by the difference between their abundance in bat foraging habitats. These findings suggest that moth defensive tactics, bat countertactics and moth availability collectively shape the diets of insectivorous bats. This study illustrates the importance of using a combination of behavioural experiments and molecular genetic techniques to reveal the complex interactions between predators and prey in nature.",

            "abstractNote": "Skin is the largest mammalian organ and the first defensive barrier against the external environment. The skin and fur of mammals can host a wide variety of ectoparasites, many of which are phylogenetically diverse, specialized, and specifically adapted to their hosts. Among hematophagous dipteran parasites, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to serve as important attractants, leading parasites to compatible sources of blood meals. VOCs have been hypothesized to be mediated by host-­associated bacteria, which may thereby indirectly influence parasitism. Host-­ associated bacteria may also influence parasitism directly, as has been observed in interactions between animal gut microbiota and malarial parasites. Hypotheses relating bacterial symbionts and eukaryotic parasitism have rarely been tested among humans and domestic animals, and to our knowledge have not been tested in wild vertebrates. In this study, we used Afrotropical bats, hematophagous ectoparasitic bat flies, and haemosporidian (malarial) parasites vectored by bat flies as a model to test the hypothesis that the vertebrate host microbiome is linked to parasitism in a wild system. We identified significant correlations between bacterial community composition of the skin and dipteran ectoparasite prevalence across four major bat lineages, as well as striking differences in skin microbial network characteristics between ectoparasitized and nonectoparasitized bats. We also identified links between the oral microbiome and presence of malarial parasites among miniopterid bats. Our results support the hypothesis that microbial symbionts may serve as indirect mediators of parasitism among eukaryotic hosts and parasites.",
