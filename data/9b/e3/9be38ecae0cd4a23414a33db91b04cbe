It was expected that their buccal morphological structures are adapted to this type of feeding. Consequently, buccal cavity and lingual structures of E. wahlbergi were examined by extended focus light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphology of the tongue of E. wahlbergi was similar to that of other fruitand nectar-feeding bats. The elongated tongue of these bats possessed ﬁliform and conical papillae as mechanical papillae and fungiform and circumvallate papillae as gustatory papillae that varied in distribution. Epomophorus wahlbergi had ﬁve palatal ridges and one post-dental palatal ridge, and relatively wide, ﬂattened molar teeth. A hard, papillae structure at the posterior end of the upper palate of the upper plate, which has not been previously described, was observed. It appears that this structure works together with the palatal ridges and teeth, so that the bats crush ﬂeshy fruits during feeding and extract the juices before discarding the pulp. Consequently, lingual and particularly palatal structures of E. wahlbergi show morphological adaptations for efﬁciently feeding on ﬂeshy fruit and nectar.",

Length of forearm and body mass of 1-day-old neonates averaged 19.59 ± 1.23 mm and 3.59 ± 0.23 g and followed linear pattern of growth at mean growth rates of 0.74 mm/day and 0.15 g/day until 28 days of age, after which is increased slowly. A similar nonlinear growth pattern was found for ten wing characteristics (wingspan, wing area, handwing length, handwing area, armwing length, armwing area, aspect ratio, wing loading, tip length ratio, and tip area ratio). However, postnatal growth followed a two phase linear pattern of increase-decrease for the epiphyseal-phalangeal gap and decreaseincrease for wing loading. At birth, infant bats produced low, short frequency sonar and oral calls in isolation before they could open their eyes. Isolation calls obtained at age 1-4 days old from M. capaccinii pups were frequency modulated shallow calls with longer duration (7.54 ± 1.83 ms) and lower peak frequency (20.07 ± 0.89 kHz) compared to adult female calls (2.35 ± 0.75 ms and 54.02 ± 4.34 kHz). During days 12-16, calls began to resemble adult echolocation calls. Duration of calls increased slightly before 7 days old and then gradually decreased. The peak, start and end frequencies of spontaneous calls increased with age. When the juvenile bats started foraging outside the cave, they only omitted nasal FM calls with 1-2 harmonics. Comparing postnatal changes in body and wing characteristics with those of vocalization, we found that the most positive correlation was between body (forearm length and body mass) and wing features (wing area, wingspan, handwing area, armwing area and aspect ratio) and call parameters (peak, start and end frequency), while wing loading had a significant negative correlation with the call parameters.",

            "abstractNote": "Small mammalian remains were newly discovered from the Late Quaternary sediments of the Yaeyama region (Ishigaki and Yonaguni Islands) in the southwestern-most part of Japan. We examined these materials based on taxonomical and chronological approaches, in order to reconstruct the past fauna in this region. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry radiocarbon dating indicates that the mammalian assemblages from Ishigaki and Yonaguni Islands are composed mainly of late Holocene fossils. The fossil assemblage from Ishigaki Island comprises five species of small mammals belonging to Soricomorpha (Suncus murinus), Chiroptera (Pteropus sp., Hipposideros turpis, and Rhinolophus perditus), and Rodentia (Niviventer sp.). One rodent bone, collected from the fissure sediments near Sabichi-do Cave, Ishigaki Island, is dated at 230 ± 20 yBP (ca. AD 1,700), and is considered part of the recent remain. Furthermore, the fossil assemblage from Umabana-zaki Fissure, on Yonaguni Island, is dated at 1,760 ± 20 yBP (ca. AD 300) and comprises three species of small mammals belonging to Chiroptera (Pipistrellus cf. abramus) and Rodentia (Niviventer sp. and Mus musculus). Niviventer is not currently distributed in Japan. Only domestic rats (Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus) live on Ishigaki and Yonaguni Islands at the present time. However, the fossil assemblage from Umabana-zaki Fissure is dominated completely by Niviventer sp. Most fossils of small mammals found from the late Holocene Ishigaki and Yonaguni Islands represented species that are currently endemic to the Yaeyama region. Niviventer sp. from these islands is unique because this form has never been found from neighboring regions, such as Taiwan and Miyako Islands, and because it likely existed in the late Holocene. These discoveries support the hypothesis that the Yaeyama region had been isolated zoogeographically from the continent even during the Last Glacial Maximum, when the sea level had drastically fallen.",

Both species of bats share the same guild in the island and are similar in size, which allow the prediction of overlapping echolocation inventories following both the “vocal plasticity hypothesis” and the “scaling hypothesis.” In addition, large body size predicts the emission of low frequency calls in the human audible range. Calls recorded during hunting show that the bats’ echolocation repertoires are very similar and of low frequency, with most differences in search calls. Matches were found in the calls’ design, duration, slope, bandwidth, and spectral parameters. Statistical differences between search calls are consistent with the predictions from the “scaling hypothesis,” considering that E. glaucinus is only slightly larger than N. macrotis. The echolocation calls emitted by both species are in the frequency range below 20–25 kHz, which identifies both species as the only ones with echolocation in the human audible range in Cuba.",

Therefore it is subjected to different climatic conditions that affect its reproduction, leading to different reproductive strategies such as continuous reproduction, seasonal monoestry or seasonal bimodal polyestry. In this study we used morphometric and histological methods to analyze the annual reproductive activity of A. lituratus males in a population living in the Atlantic Forest, Southeastern Brazil. Testis mass, epididymis mass, gonadosomatic index, seminiferous tubule diameter, and Leydig cell nucleus diameter showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the two seasons (wet: October to March; dry: April to September). Additionally, the cauda epididymis was packed with sperm throughout the period of study. Our data indicate that in this population spermatogenic activity was continuous throughout the year. Slight variations in accumulated frequency of pre-meiotic, meiotic and post-meiotic stages of the seminiferous epithelium cycle were observed when compared to other bat species, probably due to species-specific characteristics.",

Despite a large number of specimens in collections, its variability in South America has been underestimated, potentially leading to errors in identification. In order to clarify the taxonomic limits of M. albescens and to evaluate previous hypotheses of geographic variation in size we analyzed the type material and studied the variability in South American samples using multivariate exploratory and confirmatory procedures, as well as frequency analyses of discrete morphological data. The presence of a fringe of hairs along the trailing edge of the uropatagium, the long and silky pelage with frosted appearance on the dorsum, ear 9 to 14 mm long, broad interorbital and postorbital constrictions, and a globular braincase were identified as the most useful traits to distinguish M. albescens from its South American congeners. In agreement with Bergman’s rule, larger specimens were found in the South. Beyond the geographic component, Individual variation is an important factor affecting the variability in the size and shape of the skull and pelage color.",

These ticks are vectors of pathogens to animals and humans, including the causative agent of the New World Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Species of the Amblyomma parasitize a wide range of organisms, especially medium and large terrestrial mammals. Here we report for the first time the association of Myotis lavali Moratelli, Peracchi, Dias & Oliveira, 2011, Noctilio albiventris Desmarest, 1818 and Noctilio leporinus (Linnaeus, 1758) as hosts for Amblyomma sculptum Berlese, 1888. The ticks were originally identified as Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787), in 2011. However, a later taxonomic review indicated that the species of the A. cajennense complex occurring in the Caatinga is A. sculptum. We also discuss the ecoepidemiological implications of this association.",

We think that part of this controversy comes from pooling data on bat captures and moonlight intensity according to broad categories, such as moon phases, which conceal the high variability among nights. Therefore, we used detailed, long-term field data on three phyllostomid bat species, in order to test the hypothesis of lunar phobia at two different time scales: 1) among nights, by pooling data of different nights according to moon phases and testing for differences in the distribution of captures; and 2) within a night, by analyzing the relationship between capturability and moonlight intensity (measured as illuminance) in one-hour intervals for 29 individual nights. Although most captures of the studied bat species occurred in the first half of the night, their activity pattern varied largely among nights, and was not always unimodal as commonly assumed. At the larger time scale, all studied bat species showed evidence of lunar phobia, as they were more frequently captured on dark moon phases. Nevertheless, at the smaller time scale, only Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758) was less frequently captured on brighter periods of the night. We propose that the unimodal activity pattern assumed for frugivorous phyllostomid bats may be an artifact of data organization, and that activity and lunar phobia are much more variable than previously assumed.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Abandoned mines offer important roosting habitat for several species of bats throughout the western United States. Currently, abandoned mine reclamation programs are tasked with closing abandoned mines to ameliorate safety, health, and environmental hazards found in and around these sites. Without appropriate pre‐closure evaluations to determine use of mine workings prior to closure, bats that depend on abandoned mines may be negatively impacted. To mitigate impacts of abandoned mine reclamation on bats, surveyors typically conduct pre‐closure biological evaluations and recommend wildlife compatible closures (e.g., bat gates) for ecologically important sites. Due to hazardous conditions found in many abandoned mines, internal surveys cannot always be conducted, and external surveys are not reliable for determining underground habitat or inferring past, future, or potential use of mines by bats when they are absent during external surveys. The purpose of our study was to use internal mine surveys to examine relationships between abandoned mine use by bats and characteristics of the mine and landscape, including portal area and shape, number of portals, mine depth, elevation, proximity to water and land use type. We found that surface features including land use type, distance to water, and elevation were associated with bat use, as were several mine features including depth of workings and portal shape. To best conserve sensitive species of bats, it is essential that pre‐closure biological evaluations be as detailed as possible to enhance biological understanding of species' roosting associations and distribution throughout the landscape. Further information will best facilitate development of ecologically sound closure recommendations for abandoned mine openings.",

More important from a conservation perspective, artiﬁcial roosts provide habitat where natural roosts have been lost. Although artiﬁcial roosts have been widely used, much of the information on species that use artiﬁcial roosts, roost design, and placement is anecdotal and poorly reported. We reviewed the existing literature on artiﬁcial roosts to summarize current research and inform research and management decisions. From 47 publications and reports, we identiﬁed 48 types of structures used by 59 species. Roosts were constructed from wood (66.7%), concrete (8.3%), or other materials (25.0%) and varied in size and shape from small-volume wood boxes (0.002 m3) to large (6 m tall) free-standing structures. Variables most often considered in the context of attracting bats were aspect, substrate, and mount location; few studies measured height or microclimate. Colonization rates ranged from 7% to 100%. Bats commonly used structures as solitary (21 species) or social (breeding or maternity; 21 species) roosts. Most species documented to use artiﬁcial roosts are vespertilionids (73%), have the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s designation of least concern (93%), and roost in tree cavities or buildings. Three species are designated as endangered (Myotis sodalis) or near threatened (M. bechsteinii, M. dasycneme). Artiﬁcial roosts should be constructed and installed to mimic natural roosts, emphasize requirements of target species, and exclude non-target species. Monitoring species composition and identifying effects of roost density will help determine conservation impacts of artiﬁcial roosts. Ó 2014 The Wildlife Society.",

Anthropogenic causes have altered forest structure, decreasing density of large snags. To examine use of artiﬁcial roosts for bats in these forests, we selected 26 sites and 2 treatments (clustered, single) using 1 type of roost (resin or wood) per site. At each site, we installed 4 roosts on ponderosa pine trees with a cluster of 3 roosts (south-, east-, or west-facing; <20 m apart) and a single roost (south-facing) 250–350 m away. We checked roosts every 2 weeks for use (guano or bats) and monitored internal temperatures every 2 hours from May through September in 2009 and 2010. Bats used 52% of roosts (19 roosts in 2009, 49 in 2010) at least once and colonized resin roosts sooner than wood roosts. Sites with clustered resin roosts were used more than single roosts. Bats used south- and east-facing resin roosts more and these had warmer average temperatures than west-facing roosts. We captured 47 bats of 5 species using artiﬁcial roosts. We only captured male bats from roosts in 2009, juveniles and females were also captured in 2010 but no maternity roosts were documented. We recommend that resin roosts placed in clusters on live trees be used to supplement natural roosts in ponderosa pine forests. Because use increased with time we suspect artiﬁcial roosts may be used for several years before establishment of maternity colonies. Artiﬁcial roosts require annual maintenance (e.g., waterprooﬁng) to maintain function and can be expensive to install and maintain. ß 2012 The Wildlife Society.",

            "abstractNote": "Forest management rarely considers protecting bats in Fennoscandian regions although all species rely on forest habitat at some point in their annual cycle. This issue is especially evident as wind parks have increasingly been developed inside Fennoscandian forests, against the advice of international bat conservation guidelines. In this study, we aimed to describe and explain bat community dynamics at a Norwegian wind park located in a boreal forest, especially to understand potential avoidance or attraction effects. The bat community was sampled acoustically and described using foraging guilds (short, medium, and long‐range echolocators; SRE, MRE, LRE) as well as behavior (commuting, feeding and social calls). Sampling was undertaken at two locations per turbine: 1) the turbine pad and 2) a paired natural habitat at ground level, as well as from a meteorological tower. We used a recently developed method for camera trapping nocturnal flying insects synchronously with bat acoustic activity. Our results reveal trends in feeding and general bat activity across foraging guilds in relation to insect availability, habitat type, wind, temperature, and seasonality. We show how seasonal patterns in behavior across guilds were affected by habitat type, temperature, and wind. We found that SRE commuting and especially feeding activity was highest in natural habitats, whereas LRE overall activity at habitats more season dependent. We found that nocturnal insect availability was positively correlated with total bat feeding activity throughout the night. Our results provide evidence for both direct and indirect risks to bat communities by wind parks: SRE bat habitat is lost to wind energy infrastructure and LRE bat may have an increased risk of fatality. Our findings provide important insights on seasonal and spatial variability in bat activity, which can inform standardizing monitoring of bats acoustically in boreal forests, at wind parks, and in combination with non‐invasive insect monitoring.",

The case fatality rate remains the highest among infectious diseases, and medical treatments have proven ineffective.\nObjective.—This study analyzes the rabies epidemic of 1929 to 1937 in Trinidad from a geographical perspective, using Geographic Information System (GIS) software as an analytical tool. Setting.—A small island developing country at a time when infectious diseases were rampant.\nMethods.—A review of the literature was undertaken, and data were collected on the occurrence of disease in both animal and humans populations and mapped using GIS software. Several factors identiﬁed in the literature were further explored such as land use/land cover, rainfall and magnetic declination.\nResults.—The bat rabies epidemic of 1923 to 1937 in Trinidad was migratory and seasonal, shifting to new locations along a deﬁnite path. The pattern of spread appears to be spatially linked to land use/land cover. The epidemic continues to present many unexplained peculiarities.\nConclusion.—Despite the fact that this epidemic occurred almost 7 decades ago, the application of new tools available for public health use can create new knowledge and understanding of events. We showed that the spatial of distribution of the disease followed a distinct pathway possible due to the use of electromagnetic capabilities of bats.",

Euderma maculatum, a state-protected species in Nevada, was recorded at 2 sites. Our work provides information that will be useful in managing bat habitat, especially with regard to mining activities.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat activity in the southeastern United States is concentrated over riparian areas and wetland habitats. The restoration and creation of wetlands for mitigation purposes is becoming common in the Southeast. Understanding the effects of these restoration efforts on wetland ﬂora and fauna is thus becoming increasingly important. Because bats (Order: Chiroptera) consist of many species that are of conservation concern and are commonly associated with wetland and riparian habitats in the Southeast (making them a good general indicator for the condition of wetland habitats), we monitored bat activity over restored and reference Carolina bays surrounded by pine savanna (Pinus spp.) or mixed pine-hardwood habitat types at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. In order to determine how wetland restoration efforts affected the bat community, we monitored bat activity above drained Carolina bays pre- and post-restoration. Our results indicate that bat activity was greater over reference (i.e., undrained) than drained bays prior to the restorative efforts. One year following combined hydrologic and vegetation treatment, however, bat activity was generally greater over restored than reference bays. Bat activity was also greater over both reference and restored bays than in random, forested interior locations. We found signiﬁcantly more bat activity after restoration than prior to restoration for all but one species in the treatment bays, suggesting that Carolina bay restoration can have almost immediate positive impacts on bat activity.",

We tested swabs from 4597 bats (897 from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 2191 from Cameroon and 1509 from Guinea) with a broadly reactive PCR in the RdRp region. Coronaviruses were detected in 903 (19.6%) bats and in all species, with more than 25 individuals tested. The highest prevalence was observed in Eidolon helvum (239/733; 39.9%) and Rhinolophus sp. (306/899; 34.1%), followed by Hipposideros sp. (61/291; 20.9%). Frugivorous bats were predominantly infected with beta coronaviruses from the Nobecovirus subgenus (93.8%), in which at least 6 species/genus-speciﬁc subclades were observed. In contrast, insectivorous bats were infected with beta-coronaviruses from different subgenera (Nobecovirus (8.5%), Hibecovirus (32.8%), Merbecovirus (0.5%) and Sarbecovirus (57.6%)) and with a high diversity of alpha-coronaviruses. Overall, our study shows a high prevalence and genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats and illustrates that Rhinolophus bats in Africa are infected at high levels with the Sarbecovirus subgenus, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. It is important to characterize in more detail the different coronavirus lineages from bats for their potential to infect human cells, their evolution and to study frequency and modes of contact between humans and bats in Africa.",

            "abstractNote": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are divided into the genera α-CoVs, β-CoVs, γ-CoVs and δ-CoVs. Of these, α-CoVs and β-CoVs are solely capable of causing infections in humans, resulting in mild to severe respiratory symptoms. Bats have been identiﬁed as natural reservoir hosts for CoVs belonging to these two genera. Consequently, research on bat populations, CoV prevalence in bats and genetic characterization of bat CoVs is of special interest to investigate the potential transmission risks. We present the genome sequence of a novel α-CoV strain detected in rectal swab samples of Miniopterus fuliginosus bats from a colony in the Wavul Galge cave (Koslanda, Sri Lanka). The novel strain is highly similar to Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1, an α-CoV located in the subgenus of Minunacoviruses. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed a high identity of the novel strain to other α-CoVs derived from Miniopterus bats, while human-pathogenic α-CoV strains like HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 were more distantly related. Comparison with selected bat-related and humanpathogenic strains of the β-CoV genus showed low identities of ~40%. Analyses of the different genes on nucleotide and amino acid level revealed that the non-structural ORF1a/1b are more conserved among α-CoVs and β-CoVs, while there are higher variations in the structural proteins known to be important for host speciﬁcity. The novel strain was named batCoV/MinFul/2018/SriLanka and had a prevalence of 50% (66/130) in rectal swab samples and 58% (61/104) in feces samples that were collected from Miniopterus bats in Wavul Galge cave. Based on the differences between strain batCoV/MinFul/2018/SriLanka and human-pathogenic α-CoVs and β-CoVs, we conclude that there is a rather low transmission risk to humans. Further studies in the Wavul Galge cave and at other locations in Sri Lanka will give more detailed information about the prevalence of this virus.",

Although bats harbor many species of viruses, their role as reservoir hosts in emergent zoonoses has been veriﬁed only in a few cases. With bats being the second most diverse order of mammals, their implication in arbovirus infections needs to be elucidated. Reports on arbovirus infections in bats are scarce, especially in South American indigenous species. In this work, we report the genomic detection and identiﬁcation of two different alphaviruses in oral swabs from bats captured in Northern Uruguay. Phylogenetic analysis identiﬁed Río Negro virus (RNV) in two different species: Tadarida brasiliensis (n = 6) and Myotis spp. (n = 1) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in Myotis spp. (n = 2). Previous studies of our group identiﬁed RNV and EEEV in mosquitoes and horse serology, suggesting that they may be circulating in enzootic cycles in our country. Our ﬁndings reveal that bats can be infected by these arboviruses and that chiropterans could participate in the viral natural cycle as virus ampliﬁers or dead-end hosts. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of these mammals in the biological cycle of these alphaviruses in Uruguay.",

There, wildlife is commonly traded under poor sanitary conditions in open markets; these markets have been considered ‘the perfect storm’ for zoonotic disease transmission. We assessed the potential of wildlife trade in spreading viral diseases by quantifying the number of wild animals of four mammalian orders (Rodentia, Chiroptera, Carnivora and Primates) on sale in 14 Indonesian wildlife markets and identifying zoonotic viruses potentially hosted by these animals. We constructed a network analysis to visualize the animals that are traded alongside each other that may carry similar viruses. We recorded 6725 wild animals of at least 15 species on sale. Cities and markets with larger human population and number of stalls, respectively, offered more individuals for sale. Eight out of 15 animal taxa recorded are hosts of 17 zoonotic virus species, nine of which can infect more than one species as a host. The network analysis showed that long-tailed macaque has the greatest potential for spreading viral diseases, since it is simultaneously the most traded species, sold in 13/14 markets, and a potential host for nine viruses. It is traded alongside pig-tailed macaques in three markets, with which it shares six viruses in common (Cowpox, Dengue, Hepatitis E, Herpes B, Simian foamy, and Simian retrovirus type D). Short-nosed fruit bats and large ﬂying foxes are potential hosts of Nipah virus and are also sold in large quantities in 10/14 markets. This study highlights the need for better surveillance and sanitary conditions to avoid the negative health impacts of unregulated wildlife markets.",

This study explored the presence of coronaviruses in four wild mammal orders in France: Bats, rodents, lagomorphs, and hedgehogs. Betacoronavirus and Alphacoronavirus genera were identiﬁed. The results obtained suggest the circulation of potentially evolving virus strains, with the potential to cross the species barrier.",

Two completely new influenza A virus subtypes were recently discovered in bats, dramatically expanding the host range of the virus. These bat viruses are extremely divergent from all other known strains and likely have unique replication cycles. Phylogenetic analysis indicates long-term, isolated evolution in bats. This is supported by a high seroprevalence in sampled bat populations. As bats represent ~20% of all classified mammals, these findings suggests the presence of a massive cryptic reservoir of poorly characterized influenza A viruses. Here, we review the exciting progress made on understanding these newly discovered viruses, and discuss their zoonotic potential.",

            "abstractNote": "Antigenic characterisation of over 350 chiropteran rabies viruses of the Americas, especially from species reported rabid in Canada, distinguished 13 viral types. In close accord with this classiﬁcation, nucleotide sequencing of representative isolates, at both the N and G loci, identiﬁed four principal phylogenetic groups (I – IV), sub-groups of which circulated in particular bat species. Amongst the North American bat viruses, there was a notable division between group I specimens associated with colonial, non-migratory bats (Myotis sp. and Eptesicus fuscus) and those of group II harbored by solitary, migratory species (Lasiurus sp. and Lasionycteris nocti6agans). Certain species of Myotis were clearly identiﬁed as rabies reservoirs, an observation often obscured previously by their frequent infection by viral variants of other chiroptera. An additional group (III) apparently circulates in E. fuscus, whilst viruses harbored by both insectivorous and haematophagus bats of Latin America clustered to a separate clade (group IV). Comparison of the predicted N and G proteins of these viruses with those of strains of terrestrial mammals indicated a similarity in structural organisation regardless of host species lifestyle. Finally, these sequences permitted examination of the evolutionary relationship of American bat rabies viruses within the Lyssa6irus genus. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
