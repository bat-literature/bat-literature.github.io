We mist‐netted bats monthly from January 2016 to June 2017 for five nonconsecutive nights per month. Thirty‐nine sites were surveyed: 24 in traditional farms, nine in the savannah and six in the forests. A total of 668 bats were captured during 81 nights of capture, covering seven families, 21 genera and 36 species. This included 26 species in traditional farms, 13 species in savannah and 11 species in the forest. Micropteropus pusillus was the most abundant species (30.7%) recorded, followed by Hipposideros ruber (24.9%). The sample efficiency was estimated at 72.1% with fitted species accumulation curves not reaching asymptotes for the three habitat types, suggesting that the survey did not record all the bats present. There was an indication of general increased in abundance of bats during the dry and rainy seasons but it is not significant (Mann–Whitney U: 783.5, p = .195). The rarity index was highest in traditional farms (0.44), followed by savannah (0.38) and then forest (0.33). This preliminary survey provides baseline data on the distribution of bats in the different vegetation types in the Centre Region of Cameroon.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat-mediated human rabies is a viral zoonotic disease that poses a serious threat to the public health of tradi­ tional peoples, especially indigenous populations that maintain primitive cultural and social habits, such as the Maxakali ethnic group, located in the southeastern region of Brazil. The sociocultural habit of this population led to the emergence between April and May 2022 of the viral spillover of rabies transmitted by bats, which deci­ mated the lives of four children from this population who maintained contact with this animal as a recreational practice. Because the vampire bats Desmodus rotundus have exceptional ecology and social characteristics that can have important effects on the dynamics of viral dispersion in this indigenous population, I present the dy­ namics of contact between native children and the bat and the meaning of this relationship, which involves ritualistic and recreational significance. As important as knowing the reasons for this practice is discussing some intrinsic and extrinsic factors that imply risks that intensify the vulnerability of this population to the trans­ mission of the rabies virus at any time. In view of this, I warn of the need to adopt efficient strategies to mitigate the risks of a new emergency in this region. Although emergency containment measures were carried out during the critical period of the outbreak, such animal and environmental control actions must become routine pro­ grammatic and structuring interventions. Essential for rabies surveillance in this population is to develop culturally adapted interethnic health education campaigns to guarantee the accessibility of the Maxakali indigenous people to the content taught, so that any attempt at domestication, captivity and recreational practices with bats of any species is discouraged, thus avoiding a possible re-emergence of this anthropozoonosis that has impacted not only the epidemiological scenario in this region, but throughout Brazil, and also throughout Latin America.",

            "abstractNote": "This study aimed to determine the occurrence of Leishmania infection in bats in urban and wild areas in an endemic municipality for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Between April 2014 to April 2015, 247 bats were captured and classified into 26 species belonging to Phyllostomidae (90.7%), Ves­ pertilionidae (8.1%) and Molossidae (1.2%) families. Blood samples from 247 bats were collected and submitted to nested-PCR, targeting the variable V7-V8 region of the SSU rRNA gene, followed by sequencing of the PCR product. The overall infection rate of Leishmania spp. in bats was 4.4%. Of the eleven bats infected, ten were frugivorous bats: Artibeus planirostris (8/11), Artibeus lituratus (1/11) and Artibeus cinereus (1/11) and one a nectarivorous bat (Glossophaga soricina). None of the individuals exhibited macroscopic alterations in the skin, spleen or liver. Phylogenetic analysis separated Leishmania species in clades corresponding to the subgenera Viannia, Leishmania, and Mundinia, and supported that the isolates characterized in the present study clustered closely with Leishmania (Viannia) sp., Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum and Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. Here we report for the first time the bat Artibeus cinereus as a host of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. In the study we found that the mean abundance of bats did not differ in wild habitats and urban areas and that batparasite interactions were similarly distributed in the two environments. On the other hand, further studies should be conducted in more recent times to verify whether there have been changes in these parameters.",

            "abstractNote": "This study aims to describe the natural Leptospira occurrence in small mammals from Yucatan, Mexico, and to explore the relation between the characteristics of the capture sites and the Leptospira occurrence. Bats and rodents were captured in five sites of Yucatan state, and from them, a kidney fragment was collected that was used in the genomic DNA extraction. Leptospira DNA was identified by PCR targeting the 16S-rRNA and LipL32 genes. Additionally, a bioinformatic analysis was carried out to know the Leptospira species and was corroborated with a phylogenetic tree. The assemblage of small mammals was compound of 82 (51.2 %) bats and 78 (48.8 %) rodents. A global frequency (bats plus rodents) of Leptospira occurrence of 21.2 % (34/160) was observed; in bats, it was 21.9 % (18/82), and in rodents, 20.5 % (16/78). The phylogenetic trees based on LipL32 gene showed that the recovered sequences most closely resemble the species L. borgpetersenii and L. noguchii. The ordination of the capture sites with tropical deciduous forests as original vegetation is more related to the abundance of Leptospira-infected rodents. The ordination of the capture sites with tropical sub-deciduous forests as original vegetation is more related to the diversity of Leptospira-infected bat species. The canonical ordering of the capture sites is by the original vegetation type and the diversity and abundance of Leptospira-infected bat and rodent species.",

In total, 68 animals of six bat species were live-monitored with measurement of the wholebody activity concentrations of the two radionuclides (90Sr and 137Cs) and blood sampling for further analysis. We found statistically significant positive correlations between the blood neutrophil count and whole-body 90Sr activity concentration in individuals of Eptesicus serotinus; and between the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and 90Sr concentration, and between the red blood cell (RBC) count and 137Cs concentration in Vespertilio murinus. We did not observe any correlation between concentrations of 90Sr and 137Cs and hematological parameters in individuals of Pipistrellus nathusii. Moreover, none of these three species showed significant sexual (male versus female) or age (adult versus sexually immature) differences in 90Sr and 137Cs concentrations. Our results contribute to better knowledge and understanding of the eco-immunology of free-ranging bats in one of the most radioactively contaminated areas in the world — the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the relationship between radionuclide contamination and hematological parameters of bats.",

These vocalizations may serve to attract audiences for help, warn individuals of danger, and confuse the predator. Here, we aim to assess the function of distress calls in free-living least horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus pusillus. We recorded distress calls from four allopatric colonies in mainland China. Playback trials, consisting of distress calls, silence, and noise, were presented to bats outside three bat roosts. Rhinolophus pusillus emitted long, harsh, broadband calls when under duress. Playback of distress calls induced a significant increase in bat passes at the loudspeaker in comparison with control trials. The number of recorded echolocation pulses increased 3.2–6.1 folds during playbacks of distress calls compared to playbacks of silence, and 2.9–5.2 folds compared to playbacks of noise. There was a positive association between bat passes and echolocation vocalizations. However, some bats delayed their emergence from the roost in response to distress call stimuli. Despite similar delayed responses, more bat passes were detected in the presence of allopatric distress calls than those from colony members. Overall, the results indicate that distress calls could attract and warn conspecifics in least horseshoe bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Niche partitioning is a strategy that favors the coexistence of sympatric species and prevents resource competition. Resource partitioning not only occurs along a temporal and spatial axis, but also within the niche breadth. The lesser long-nosed (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) and the Pallas’s long-tongued (Glossophaga soricina) bats are sympatric throughout much of their distribution range. Both species can be found in the Mexican tropical dry forest and co-occur during the winter in the pacific coast of Michoacán. These bats have similar requirements but differ in morphological characteristics associated with their particular methods for obtaining food. We evaluate whether these species exhibit niche partitioning in diet and activity patterns during their period of coexistence. Bats were sampled each month from April 2016 to March 2017, and mist-nets were set up at ground level from 19:00 to 03:00 h in Lazaro Cardenas, Michoacán. Diet was determined by taking pollen samples from bat fur and feces, and patterns of daily activity were analyzed. We found greater abundance of bats during November to January, which corresponds to the dry season. This abundance may be associated with a greater availability of floral resources in the study area. Bats fed on nectar from plants of the families Bombacaeae, Fabaceae, Convolvulaceae, Apocynaceae, Cactaceae and Rosaseae. We found no evidence that the diet of the species changes in relation to the presence of potential competitors. However, we found niche partitioning in daily activity patterns of G. soricina related to a high density of L. yerbabuenae.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding foraging habits can be important for elucidating the ecology of any species and for designing appropriate conservation strategies. Common methods for determining bat diets, such as morphological examination of fecal material or recovery of prey fragments under feeding roosts, can be biased towards larger prey with harder exoskeletons by underestimating frequency/occurrence of smaller, softer bodied prey items. Our objectives were to determine prey selection for several common chiropteran species of bottomland hardwood forests in east Texas and to evaluate the use of DNA barcoding for dietary studies by comparing dietary composition to prey availability in four species of bats. We amplified the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene from fecal samples collected from 19 bats of four species and identified arthropods by comparison to the Barcode of Life Data System database. We compared frequency of occurrence in fecal samples to frequency in concurrent night-flying insect sampling. We identified nine insect species from three orders consumed by Perimyotis subflavus, nine species from four orders consumed by Lasiurus seminolus, seven species from three orders consumed by Nycticeius humeralis, and 11 species from two orders consumed by Lasiurus borealis. Coleoptera was the most abundant order available by biomass, but beetles were never found in fecal samples from L. seminolus (n = 5) or L. borealis (n = 7) bats. However, Coleoptera comprised a substantial portion of prey identified from P. subflavus (n = 2) and N. humeralis samples (n = 5). Lepidopteran prey items were found in 13 of 19 bat fecal samples across all species but represented < 7% of arthropod biomass. Although dipteran species were a negligible portion (< 1%) of the available biomass, large numbers of dipterans were identified in fecal samples from all species of bats (13 of 19 samples across all species). Lasiurus seminolus and L. borealis may be selecting prey based on digestibility rather than availability; whereas, both N. humeralis and P. subflavus exhibited a more opportunistic approach to foraging. Based on comparison to other studies of bat diets, traditional techniques for analyzing diet from fecal samples are likely underrepresenting soft-bodied arthropods like dipterans.",

Although bats of the park were included in many publications, none were recorded from the mangrove ecosystem. We recently conducted field surveys through the wetland areas of the park and recorded three horseshoe bat species: Marshall's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus marshalli), Pearson’s horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus pearsonii), and the least horseshoe bat (R. pusillus). Of these, R. pearsonii is the most common species. We here provide morpholocal and acoustic features of each species with notes on the importance of the mangrove forest in the park for bat research and conservation.",

Records of T. tricolor are from Aripuanã, Usina Hidrelétrica (UHE) Colíder (both in the northern Mato Grosso state) and Santana do Araguaia (southern Pará state). New records of T. devivoi are from a Cerrado area in the Rio Manso, Rio Quilombo (both in Mato Grosso state) and from an Amazon rainforest area at Juruti (Pará state). The records of Thyroptera devivoi for Pará and Mato Grosso are the first ones for these states and the records from the latter are based on two specimens previously identified as T. discifera. Based on the new identifications, we argue that T. discifera does not occur in the Cerrado.",

There are 431 entries in the three catalogs: 33.2% are mammals; 27.1% are birds; 29.2% are reptiles; and 10.4% are amphibians. Collectively, 151 (35%) of the name combinations applied to terrestrial vertebrates described from Texas are now in synonymy and presently unavailable for taxonomic designation. The peak period of discovery and description of these taxa occurred in the latter half of the 19th century, with 47.1% described between 1851 and 1900. Type materials have been recorded from about one-third (87/254) of Texas counties; 46% of these types were described from counties that border Mexico, with the remainder scattered across the state. Of the taxa described from Texas, 78.2% are represented by holotype specimens. A total of 207 naturalists were involved in collecting type specimens for these taxa, and 143 naturalists (68 herpetologists, 37 mammalogists, and 38 ornithologists) were senior authors of publications describing them. Biographical information is included about the most prolific describers and collectors of Texas taxa. Type specimens for these taxa are held by 77 museums and collections, including 19 in Texas, 50 institutions in 23 other US states and the District of Columbia, and 8 international institutions. We discuss the special importance of type localities and topotype specimens, including the importance of nucleic acid sequences (DNA, RNA) as a data source, relative to resolving taxonomic problems, and we propose a Type Locality Project designed to collect voucher specimens and genomic-grade samples from terrestrial vertebrate type localities in Texas, USA. The implications of the proposed project on the taxonomic correction process and conservation efforts in Texas are discussed",

To assess function in Eptesicus fuscus (Big Brown Bat), we quantify surface area of respiratory and olfactory turbinals from birth to adult size, using data from microCT scans before and after iodine staining. Surface area of each turbinal is significantly correlated with postnatal age and cranial length. The surface area of the maxilloturbinal and first ethmoturbinal (ET I) grows faster, relative to skull size, than surface area of caudal ethmoturbinals or the frontoturbinal. Histological examination of selected specimens reveals ET I grows disproportionately more presumptive respiratory mucosa than olfactory mucosa, supporting the hypothesis that ET I has a dual function. Lastly, we find that distribution of olfactory mucosa in the caudal nasal cavity diminishes with age. Our findings suggest a reduction in olfactory function in E. fuscus, perhaps due to a diminished role in food acquisition by this aerial insectivore.",

There are 38 described species, which are found parasitizing bats, rodents, marsupials, carnivores and primates. We present taxonomic notes on nematodes collected from the digestive tract of bats from the Atlantic Forest in southeast Brazil. Two species previously recorded in marsupials in this region, Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines) elegans and Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines) jagerskioldi, were found parasitizing molossid and vespertilionid bats, respectively. A new species Pterygodermatites (Pterygodermatites) atlanticaensis found in phyllostomid bats is here described. Despite earlier work based on females, taxonomic work on this group of nematodes is usually based on male characters, such as position and number of caudal papillae, which is a problem because males are short-lived and not easily found. Here we also describe in detail female characters, such as position of the last pair of cuticular processes relative to the posterior end. This is the first record of P. (Pterygodermatites) in South America and the first record of P. (Paucipectines) jagerskioldi in bats.",

Males of Notolaelaps novaguinea Womersley are fully described for the first time, protonymphs are newly described, and females redescribed. A fourth species of Neolaelaps, Ne. windsori sp. nov., previously regarded as a form of Neolaelaps vitzthumi Domrow, is described as new. Male Neolaelaps vitzthumi are described for the first time from a heavily-infested specimen of Pteropus alecto. Both genera are re-diagnosed. Relationships between Notolaelaps, Neolaelaps and the Macronyssidae are discussed.",

Here, we report the isolation of BBLV in a Natterer’s bat (Myotis nattereri) in Poland. The bat brain tested positive for rabies using classical diagnostics tests (FAT and RTCIT) and then subsequently confirmed by molecular techniques. Viral RNA was found in all peripheral organs tested, and the highest viral loads were detected in brain, the salivary gland and bladder. Phylogenetic analysis performed on complete viral genome sequences revealed the closest homology to representatives of BBLV lineage B, isolated previously in southern Germany. This case provides further evidence that BBLV is widespread in Europe.",

            "abstractNote": "Rabies is the oldest known zoonotic disease and was also the ﬁrst recognized bat associated infection in humans. To date, four different lyssavirus species are the causative agents of rabies in European bats: the European Bat Lyssaviruses type 1 and 2 (EBLV-1, EBLV-2), the recently discovered putative new lyssavirus species Bokeloh Bat Lyssavirus (BBLV) and the West Caucasian Bat Virus (WCBV). Unlike in the new world, bat rabies cases in Europe are comparatively less frequent, possibly as a result of varying intensity of surveillance. Thus, the objective was to provide an assessment of the bat rabies surveillance data in Europe, taking both reported data to the WHO Rabies Bulletin Europe and published results into account. In Europe, 959 bat rabies cases were reported to the RBE in the time period 1977–2010 with the vast majority characterized as EBLV-1, frequently isolated in the Netherlands, North Germany, Denmark, Poland and also in parts of France and Spain. Most EBLV-2 isolates originated from the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands, and EBLV-2 was also detected in Germany, Finland and Switzerland. Thus far, only one isolate of BBLV was found in Germany. Published passive bat rabies surveillance comprised testing of 28 of the 52 different European bat species for rabies. EBLV-1 was isolated exclusively from Serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus and Eptesicus isabellinus), while EBLV-2 was detected in 14 Daubenton¢s bats (Myotis daubentonii) and 5 Pond bats (Myotis dasycneme). A virus from a single Natterer’s bat (Myotis nattereri) was characterized as BBLV. During active surveillance, only oral swabs from 2 Daubenton¢s bats (EBLV-2) and from several Eptesicus bats (EBLV-1) yielded virus positive RNA. Virus neutralizing antibodies against lyssaviruses were detected in various European bat species from different countries, and its value and implications are discussed.",

The occurrence of Taphozous nudiventris magnus on the Syrian Euphrates is part of a northwestern extension of the Iraqi population, extending into southern Turkey. The present material fills a distribution gap for Otonycteris hemprichii between the Syrian, Turkish and Iraqi localities. Records for two species of the genus Microtus, Microtus (Microtus) socialis and the problematic M. (M.) philistinus, are given. Comparative material was used to confirm the identity of both species. The known range for M. socialis is thereby extended considerably further eastwards. Similarly, the present records of Cricetulus migratorius and Mus macedonicus extend the range of both species eastwards. The record of Eliomys melanurus represents a noteworthy range extension further to the north.",

The follicles which survive for prolonged periods are morphologically specialized. The accumulation of glycogen was noticed in the granulosa cells. The egg cytoplasm, thecal cells and interstitial cells were almost devoid of glycogen. The first sign of a glycogen deposit in the ovary was noticed during the recrudescence phase (October) in late pre-antral follicles. Most of the morphologically healthy late pre-antral and antral follicles showed a positive reaction with PAS and Best carmine from October to early February. Morphologically atretic follicles showed only a mild glycogen accumulation. Little or no glycogen accumulation was noticed in some of the healthy late-antral follicles before ovulation during late February and early March. HCG-induced antral follicles during quiescence also did not show any accumulation of glycogen. The study suggests that glycogen laden follicles are not suitable for ovulation and may be the reason for the occurrence of delayed ovulation in S. heathi.",
