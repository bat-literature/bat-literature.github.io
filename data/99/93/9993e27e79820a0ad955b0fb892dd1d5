We set out to better understand the difference between mist netting and acoustic detection probabilities between these two methods for the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), a species highly impacted by white-­nose syndrome and currently considered for federal listing in the United States. We also analyzed occupancy relationships with local and landcover variables. We surveyed 15 sites using mist netting paired with an acoustic recorder for multiple nights to estimate detection probability of this species. We also deployed acoustic recorders at another 73 sites. We found that detection rates for mist netting were very low but increased with day of year and decreased from proximity to water. Acoustic surveys had higher detection rates, but there was an approximately 30% likelihood of false-­ positive detections. At the mean distance to water and day of year, acoustic surveys had a detection rate 55 times higher than mist netting. There were not significant factors influencing occupancy of little brown bats, only a slight positive relationship between forested largest patch, landscape patch richness and forest basal area. Given the declines in little brown bat populations since white-­nose syndrome, it is even more critical that we consider the very low detection rate of mist netting compared to acoustic surveys.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary Aerial hawking bats use intense echolocation calls to search for insect prey. Their calls have evolved into the most intense airborne animal vocalisations. Yet our knowledge about call intensities in the ﬁeld is restricted to a small number of species. We describe a novel stereo videogrammetry method used to study ﬂight and echolocation behaviour, and to measure call source levels of the aerial hawking bat Eptesicus bottae (Vespertilionidae). Bats ﬂew close to their predicted minimum power speed. Source level increased with call duration; the loudest call of E. bottae was at 133·dB·peSPL. The calculated maximum detection distance for large ﬂying objects (e.g. large prey, conspeciﬁcs) was up to 21·m. The corresponding maximum echo delay is almost exactly the duration of one wing beat in E. bottae and this also is its preferred pulse interval. These results, obtained by using videogrammetry to track bats in the ﬁeld, corroborate earlier ﬁndings from other species from acoustic tracking methods.",

In this study we show that the velvety free-tailed bat Molossus molossus emerges just after sunset and just before sunrise for very short foraging bouts (average 82.2 min foraging per night). Contrary to previous studies, bats remain inactive in their roost between activity patterns. Activity was measured over two complete lunar cycles and there was no indication that phase of the moon had an influence on emergence time or the numbers of bats that emerged from the roost. This data suggests that M. molossus represents an example of an aerial hawking bat whose foraging behaviour is in fact adapted to the compromise between the need to exploit highest prey availability and the need to avoid predation.",

Body mass and length of forearm at birth were lowest when precipitation in the month preceding births was relatively high. In addition, body mass at birth was signi®cantly lower when ambient temperatures during late pregnancy were relatively low. Pups born to middle age mothers were heavier than pups born to young or old mothers. When evaluated using mark±recapture data (longitudinal method), postnatal growth in length of forearm and body mass was greater for pups born to middle age and older mothers and change in body mass was greater for female pups than for male pups. When growth data were evaluated using the trajectory method, the rate of growth for length of forearm was greatest when ambient temperature was highest. Age prediction equations were improved when maternal age was incorporated into predictive equations. We recommend considering both intrinsic and extrinsic variables in studies where maternal effort is evaluated and age prediction equations are used for estimating postnatal growth rates in free-ranging bats.",

To reduce the impact of White-nose Syndrome to North American little brown bat populations we evaluated if exposure to volatile organic compounds produced by induced cells from Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain DAP96253 could improve the overwinter survival of bats infected by P. destructans. Two simultaneous field treatment trials were conducted at natural hibernacula located in Rockcastle and Breckinridge counties, Kentucky, USA. A combined total of 120 little brown bats were randomly divided into control groups (n = 60) which were not exposed to volatile organic compounds and treatment groups (n = 60) which were exposed to volatile organic compounds produced by non-growth, fermented cell paste composed of R. rhodochrous strain DAP96253 cells. Cox proportional hazard models revealed a significant decreased survival at the Rockcastle field trial site but not the Breckinridge field site. At the Breckinridge hibernacula, overwinter survival for both treatment and control groups were 60%. At the Rockcastle hibernacula, Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated significantly increased overwinter survival of bats in the control group (43% survived) compared to the treatment group (20% survived). Although complete inhibition of P. destructans by volatile organic compounds produced by induced R. rhodochrous strain DAP96253 cells was observed in vitro studies, our results suggest that these volatile organic compounds do not inhibit P. destructans in situ and may promote P. destructans growth.",

Similar to other European pipistrelles, the frequency structure during foraging varied. During the search phase, the bats emitted long shallow frequency-modulated pulses 9 – 11 ms in duration, whereas the maximum pulse duration of the bats approaching a large target wall in the laboratory was 3 ms. No signiﬁcant difference was observed between decreases in the interpulse interval during these two approach ﬂights. It is concluded that the bats use a long quasi-constant frequency pulse to ﬁnd a weak echo from a small prey target.",

Vocalizations by pups on the day of birth were frequency-modulated ultrasounds from 30.0 6 4.0 kHz to 19.3 6 1.9 kHz with multiple harmonics. The terminal frequency of the second harmonic (TF2) of pup vocalizations corresponded to that of the fundamental (TF1) in adult bats (41.4 6 2.6 kHz), suggesting that pup vocalizations can be easily detected by the mother. In addition, there are two types of infant vocalization: short duration echolocation precursor and long duration isolation calls, which showed separate developmental patterns over time.",

At least 7 species of mammals belonging to Insectivora (Crocidura suaveolens) and Rodentia (Allactaga williamsi, Cricetulus migratorius, Meriones tristrami, Mescocricetus brandti, Microtus guentheri, M. sp., Mus macedonicus) were identified. Rodentia were dominant and contributed 93.8% of the number of prey items of the Long-eared Owl. Microtus guentheri accounted for 83.9% of the rodent remains. The diet pattern was more diverse in summer, when some 24% of the diet consisted of non-mammal prey items (birds, insects).",

In bat limbs A-P patterning and the size of the digital field are unique. The posterior digits of the forelimb are elongated and joined by tissue, whereas the thumb is short. The hindlimb digits often are uniform in length. Here, we reveal novel expression patterns for\n              Shh\n              and its target,\n              Patched 1\n              (\n              Ptc1\n              ), during limb development in two bat species. Early\n              Shh\n              expression in the zone of polarizing activity is wider in the bat forelimb than in the mouse forelimb, correlating with the reported expansion of\n              Fgf8\n              expression in the apical ectodermal ridge and the early loss of symmetry in the bat forelimb. Later in limb development,\n              Shh\n              and\n              Ptc1\n              expression is reinitiated in the interdigital tissue.\n              Shh\n              is graded along the A-P axis in forelimb and is expressed uniformly at a lower level across the hindlimb interdigital tissue. We also show that the reported\n              Fgf8\n              expression in the interdigital tissue precedes the expression of\n              Shh.\n              We propose that the reinitiation of\n              Shh\n              and\n              Fgf8\n              expression in bat limbs reactivates the\n              Shh-Fgf\n              feedback loop in the interdigital tissue of stage 16 bat embryos. The cell survival and proliferation signals provided by the\n              Shh-Fgf\n              signaling loop probably contribute to the lengthening of the posterior forelimb digits, the survival of the forelimb interdigital webbing, and the extension of the hindlimb digits to a uniform length.",

The characteristic lesions include hemoglobinuric nephrosis and piecemeal hepatic necrosis with bile ductular hyperplasia and portal ﬁbrosis. Certain species, such as sheep, are prone to toxicity when exposed to copper in feed, whereas an inherent genetic defect of copper storage is present in some breeds of dogs (Bedlington Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, Doberman Pinschers). In nondomestic species, reference ranges have not been established for copper in internal organs, so the establishment of copper toxicity as a diagnosis is difﬁcult. A case of copper toxicity in a captive Mexican fruit bat is presented. Hepatic copper levels in 16 additional bats, of at least 3 different species, were measured. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst reported case of copper toxicity in a chiropteran.",

The fish-eating bat Myotis vivesi is restricted mainly to the islands of the Gulf of California in Mexico and although several aspects of its biology have been studied there are no recent accounts of its current distribution. We conducted several expeditions during – to verify the current geographical distribution of this bat, and to record the presence of introduced predators. We identified the localities in which maternity colonies occur, estimated the size of the bat population on Partida Norte Island in , and monitored bat presence on this island during –. We found fish-eating bats on  islands and maternity colonies on  islands. Introduced rats Rattus rattus or cats Felis catus were captured on seven islands where the bats were present, and on five islands where they were absent. We estimated a population of c. , fish-eating bats in May  and we confirmed the species’ presence on Partida Norte Island during –. Based on the information compiled from our surveys and previous studies, we discuss the adequacy of the species’ current categorization as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and its conservation status conferred by Mexican conservation authorities.",

The alteration of the leaf ’s vascular system reduces the tent’s life expectancy, so to obtain a beneﬁt, bats are expected to use tents regularly as long as they remain functional and not modify more leaves than necessary. Over 2 yr, we documented the dynamics of tent construction and use by Uroderma convexum and other bat species in the palm Sabal mauritiiformis in a Colombian transitional dry forest. We also assessed tent condition and compared it to nonmodiﬁed leaves of approximately the same age in focal palms. Probability of tent use by U. convexum varied between 57 percent during a reproductive period and 4 percent outside of this period. Bats cut the main vein of folioles, partially affecting water transport in the leaf. However, there were no differences between tents and nonmodiﬁed leaves in deterioration scores or deterioration rates over 1 yr. During 2 yr, 48 tents were lost for different causes, but this loss was balanced by the construction of 51 new tents. Thus, bats maintained an excess of usable tents. Palm leaves are long-lived and seem preadapted to sustain damage and remain viable, particularly in species growing in dry environments. We present several hypotheses to explain the advantage of maintaining a tent surplus.",

A comparison of the succession of morphological events associated with each node (inflorescences or branches developed or aborted and underlying internode length) making up the axes of 30 trees helped to establish a link between their architecture and the regularity and synchronicity of their expression of growth, flowering, and branching processes over time on an individual and stand level. For a given individual, new nodes are emitted at the same rate on all the axes, irrespective of their branching order. Flowering and branching alternate, and these processes occur in all the axes of the tree synchronously. On a stand level, flowering and branching occur regularly every 35 nodes or so, which apparently corresponds to an annual rhythm. Under nonlimiting conditions, a single branch tier would be emitted each year, and it is thus possible to determine a posteriori the age of a crown accurately. The merits of the method, the possibility of estimating the age of natural\n              Cecropia obtusa\n              regrowth by observing tree architecture, and the possible applications in the field of ecology are discussed.",

Its possible admission to the list of British mammals depends upon a single specimen found on South Ronaldsay, Orkney, in about September 1847 (Wolley, 1849, 1850\n              a, b\n              ). From Wolley's detailed account and description, there seems no doubt of the circumstances of the finding of the specimen, nor of its identity. Doubts are only raised by the existence of a specimen of\n              Lasiurus\n              in the Zoology Museum of the University of Cambridge which had been supposed to be the Orkney specimen. This specimen was examined by Barrett‐Hamilton (1910) who reported that it was an example of the Hawaiian form\n              L. c. semotus\n              (he used the name\n              Nycteris semota\n              ), noted that it did not match Wolley's careful description, but concluded “the matter is not as clear as it might be”. This doubt has persisted to the present day, and while the record is mentioned in some accounts (e.g. van den Brink, 1967), it is omitted completely from others, notably Corbet & Southern (1977). The uncertainty has prompted this brief re‐examination of the issue; in particular, what is the identity of the specimen in Cambridge, how does it compare with Wolley's account of the Orkney specimen, and what, in the light of modern knowledge of\n              L. cinereus\n              , is the likelihood of its occurrence as a vagrant in Britain?",

            "abstractNote": "Detailed knowledge of histomorphology is a prerequisite for the understanding of function, variation, and development. In bats, as in other mammals, penis and baculum morphology are important in species discrimination and phylogenetic studies. In this study, nondestructive 3D-microtomographic (microCT, mCT) images of bacula and iodine-stained penes of Pipistrellus pipistrellus were correlated with light microscopic images from undecalciﬁed surface-stained ground sections of three of these penes of P. pipistrellus (1 juvenile). The results were then compared with mCTimages of bacula of P. pygmaeus, P. hanaki, and P. nathusii. The Y-shaped baculum in all studied Pipistrellus species has a proximal base with two clubshaped branches, a long slender shaft, and a forked distal tip. The branches contain a medullary cavity of variable size, which tapers into a central canal of variable length in the proximal baculum shaft. Both are surrounded by a lamellar and a woven bone layer and contain fatty marrow and blood vessels. The distal shaft consists of woven bone only, without a vascular canal. The proximal ends of the branches are connected with the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa via entheses. In the penis shaft, the corpus spongiosumsurrounded urethra lies in a ventral grove of the corpora cavernosa, and continues in the glans under the baculum. The glans penis predominantly comprises an enlarged corpus spongiosum, which surrounds urethra and baculum. In the 12 studied juvenile and subadult P. pipistrellus specimens the proximal branches of the baculum were shorter and without marrow cavity, while shaft and distal tip appeared already fully developed. The present combination with light microscopic images from one species enabled a more reliable interpretation of histomorphological structures in the mCT-images from all four Pipistrellus species. J.

This can derive not only from genetic mutations, but also from other sources like infectious diseases that result in color patterns which are different from those characteristic of each species. In bats, most pigmentation abnormalities have been observed in the families Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae, probably because they are the largest families in number of species and have been exceptionally well studied. For the Mormoopidae family only two cases are known. This paper documents the first case of hypopigmentation disorder in the bat Mormoops megalophylla throughout its range, recorded in two specimens captured in the state of Oaxaca, México.",

Here, we report a 47.89% Brucella infection prevalence in a colony of vampire bats inhabiting the tropical rainforest of Costa Rica. The bacterium induced placentitis and fetal death in bats. Wide-range phenotypic and genotypic characterization placed the Brucella organisms as a new pathogenic species named Brucella nosferati sp. nov., isolated from bat tissues, including the salivary glands, suggesting feeding behavior might favor transmission to their prey. Overall analyses placed B. nosferati as the etiological agent of a reported canine brucellosis case, demonstrating its potential for infecting other hosts. To assess the putative prey hosts, we analyzed the intestinal contents of 14 infected and 23 non-infected bats by proteomics. A total of 54,508 peptides sorted into 7,203 unique peptides corresponding to 1,521 proteins were identified. Twenty-three wildlife and domestic taxa, including humans, were foraged by B. nosferati-infected D. rotundus, suggesting contact of this bacterium with a broad range of hosts. Our approach is appropriate for detecting, in a single study, the prey preferences of vampire bats in a diverse area, demonstrating its suitability for control strategies where vampire bats thrive.",

            "abstractNote": "We investigated the reproductive biology, including the ﬂoral biology, pollination biology, breeding system and reproductive success, of Pachira aquatica, a native and dominant tropical tree of fresh water wetlands, throughout the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico. The ﬂowers present nocturnal anthesis, copious nectar production and sugar concentration (range 18–23%) suitable for nocturnal visitors such as bats and sphingid moths. The main nocturnal visitors were bats and sphingid moths while bees were the main diurnal visitors. There were no differences in legitimate visitation rates among bats, moths and honey bees. Bats and honey bees fed mainly on pollen while moths fed on nectar, suggesting resource partitioning. Eight species of bats carried pollen but Leptonycteris yerbabuenae is probably the most effective pollinator due to its higher pollen loads. The sphingid moths Manduca rustica, Cocytius duponchel and Eumorpha satellitia were recorded visiting ﬂowers. Hand pollination experiments indicated a predominant outcrossing breeding system. Open pollination experiments resulted in a null fruit set, indicating pollen limitation; however, mean reproductive success, according to a seasonal census, was 17 ± 3%; these contrasting results could be explained by the seasonal availability of pollinators. We conclude that P. aquatica is an outcrossing species with a pollination system originally specialized for bats and sphingid moths, which could be driven to a multimodal pollination system due to the introduction of honey bees to tropical America.",

However, we have virtually no information on whether and how disruptions in bat‐mediated biocontrol services are driven by mismatches between the temporal activity patterns of insectivorous bats and insect pests.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We investigated the temporal relationship between the nightly activity patterns of the common pipistrelle bat (\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii\n                    ) and the olive fruit moth (\n                    Prays oleae\n                    ).

Olive farms were classified as exhibiting high (i.e. HIGH olive farms;\n                    n\n                     = 27), intermediate (MID;\n                    n\n                     = 18), and low (LOW;\n                    n\n                     = 15) structural complexity.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Temporal mismatches between the activity levels of\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    and\n                    P. oleae\n                    varied between seasons and types of olive farms, being comparatively lower in summer than in spring and fall. Furthermore, summer was the only season in which temporal mismatches between species pairs differed between types of olive farms, with higher temporal mismatches found in LOW than in HIGH and MID olive farms.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Overall, our work demonstrates the existence of temporal mismatches between the nightly activity patterns of\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    and\n                    P. oleae\n                    . Furthermore, it demonstrates that the structural simplification of olive farms increases temporal mismatches between species pairs, particularly in summer when bat‐mediated biocontrol services are most needed.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Future research should consider mismatches between the temporal activity patterns of insectivorous bats and insect pests. Otherwise, the actual impact of agricultural intensification on bat‐mediated biocontrol services as well as the economic impact of their loss on the agriculture industry might be underestimated.

Os olivais foram classificados como exibindo complexidade estrutural alta (HIGH;\n                    n\n                     = 27), intermédia (MID;\n                    n\n                     = 18) ou baixa (LOW;\n                    n\n                     = 15).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    As divergências temporais entre os níveis de atividade de\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    e\n                    P. oleae\n                    variaram entre as estações do ano e tipos de olivais, sendo comparativamente menores no verão do que na primavera e outono. Além disso, o verão foi a única estação em que as divergências temporais entre pares de espécies diferiram entre tipos de olivais, com divergências temporais mais elevadas em olivais LOW do que em olivais HIGH e MID.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    No geral, o nosso trabalho demonstra a existência de divergências temporais entre os padrões de atividade noturna de\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    e\n                    P. oleae\n                    . Além disso, demonstra que a simplificação estrutural dos olivais aumenta as divergências temporais entre pares de espécies, especialmente no verão, quando os serviços de biocontrole mediados por morcegos são mais necessários.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Síntese e aplicações\n                    : Os trabalhos de investigação no futuro devem ter em conta as divergências entre os padrões temporais de atividade de morcegos insetívoros e insetos‐praga. Caso contrário, o impacto real da intensificação agrícola nos serviços de biocontrole mediados por morcegos, bem como o impacto económico da sua perda na indústria agrícola, pode ser subestimado. Para incrementar os serviços de biocontrole, propomos o aumento da disponibilidade de abrigos e locais de alimentação, bem como a conservação de áreas de bosques nativos remanescentes e árvores dispersas.",

            "abstractNote": "The fragmentation of forests by the expansion of agriculture is recognized as an important factor inﬂuencing worldwide declines of forest-dependent species. Species that are forest dependent may be especially vulnerable to fragmentation because they have specialized resource requirements and may exhibit lower mobility in an agricultural matrix. We investigated movement patterns and resource selection of forest-dependent northern long-eared myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) in a forest–agricultural landscape on Prince Edward Island, Canada. Radiotelemetry was used to locate day-roosts and to estimate locations of female bats during nightly foraging bouts. Day-roost locations and foraging areas were mapped using a geographic information system to generally characterize the forest cover of foraging and roosting areas. Vegetative structure and insect prey availability were measured in the ﬁeld and compared between foraging and roosting areas to describe resource selection at these sites. Movements of female northern long-eared myotis were constrained to forest features and foraging areas were concentrated along forest-covered creeks with bats roosting predominantly in deciduous trees within the same forest fragment, although bats at 1 site seemed to exclusively use a barn during late pregnancy and lactation. Differences in prey availability did not explain the spatial segregation of roosting and foraging areas. Relative to roost areas foraging sites were more likely to be close to forested creeks and densely forested areas, whereas roost sites were characterized by the availability of potentially suitable roosts. This study demonstrates the importance of investigating movements and resource selection of individuals in fragmented landscapes because a specialization on forest resources can highly restrict the vagility of forest-dependent species to a local environment.",

Acerodon jubatus (the Golden-Crowned flying fox) is an endemic species in the Philippines, which was suspected to be a host of the Reston strain of the Ebola virus. As nocturnal animals, the flying foxes spend daytime at the roosting site, which they use for self-maintenance and reproduction. To understand the variation in diurnal behavior and time allocation for various activities in the Golden-Crowned flying fox, we investigated their daytime behavior and activity budget using instantaneous scan sampling and all occurrence focal sampling. Data collection was performed from 07:00 to 18:00 hr during January 8–17, 2017. The most frequent activity was sleeping (76.3%). The remaining activities were wing flapping (5.0%), self-grooming (4.2%), hanging relaxation (3.4%), wing spread (2.9%), movement (2.4%), mating/courtship (2.4%), aggression (1.9%), hanging alert (1.2%), excretion (0.1%) and scent marks (0.05%). The frequency of sleeping, wing flapping, self-grooming, hanging relaxation, aggression, mating/courtship and movement behaviors changed with the time of the day. Females allocated more time for resting than males, while males spent more time on the activities that helped enhance their mating opportunities, for example, movement, sexual activity and territorial behavior.",

Understanding their population dynamics might help to explain seasonal patterns of disease prevalence, and contribute towards the conservation of flying fox populations. Therefore, this study explored the annual variation in the number of deaths in P. lylei. The study was conducted from 2015–2017, at a Buddhist temple in Thailand, which is the roosting site of P. lylei. The average total number of bat deaths in a month significantly varied between times of a year. A peak was observed during March and May, which ranged in the period of birthing and lactating. There were no significant differences in the average total number of bat deaths in a month between sexes or age classes across times of a years.",

            "abstractNote": "In this study, we explicitly examine the aerodynamics of manoeuvring flight in animals. We studied brown long-eared bats flying in a wind tunnel while performing basic sideways manoeuvres. We used particle image velocimetry in combination with high-speed filming to link aerodynamics and kinematics to understand the mechanistic basis of manoeuvres. We predicted that the bats would primarily use the downstroke to generate the asymmetries for the manoeuvre since it has been shown previously that the majority of forces are generated during this phase of the wingbeat. We found instead that the bats more often used the upstroke than they used the downstroke for this. We also found that the bats used both drag/thrust-based and lift-based asymmetries to perform the manoeuvre and that they even frequently switch between these within the course of a manoeuvre. We conclude that the bats used three main modes: lift asymmetries during downstroke, thrust/drag asymmetries during downstroke and thrust/drag asymmetries during upstroke. For future studies, we hypothesize that lift asymmetries are used for fast turns and thrust/drag for slow turns and that the choice between up- and downstroke depends on the timing of when the bat needs to generate asymmetries.",

Few studies have combined traditional methods and molecular tools for the analysis of dispersal in fragmented landscapes. Here seed dispersal distances were documented for the tree Dipteryx panamensis in continuous forest and two forest fragments in Costa Rica, Central America. Distance matrices were calculated between adult trees (n = 283) and the locations of seeds (n = 3016) encountered along 100 × 4-m transects (n = 77). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the density of seeds dispersed > 25 m from the nearest adult (n = 253) among sites. There was a strong correlation between the locations of dispersed seeds and the locations of overstorey palms favoured as bat feeding roosts in continuous forest and both fragments. Exact dispersal distances were determined for a subset of seeds (n = 14) from which maternal endocarp DNA could be extracted and matched to maternal trees using microsatellite analysis. Dispersal within fragments and from pasture trees into adjacent fragments was documented, at a maximum distance of 853 m. Results show no evidence of a fragmentation effect on D. panamensis seed dispersal in this landscape and strongly suggest bat-mediated dispersal at all sites.",

A pilot study of nine adult male bats was conducted to determine whether use of the cave was regular enough for a homing study. Eight bats returned to the cave over the 3-week monitoring period, six on the night following release. Nine additional bats carrying radio transmitters were then released at three sites (three at each site) c. 5, 10 and 20 km due east of the cave; sites estimated to be located within, on the border of, and outside the population's known familiar area respectively. All but one of these nine bats were subsequently detected at the cave. Results suggest that adult long-tailed bats are able to return home following displacement both inside and outside their familiar area. Implications of these findings for translocations of bats and the possession of a potential long-distance navigation system by this species are discussed.",

Progeny in sample fruits were tested for self or cross paternity using an isozyme genetic marker. Pseudobombax munguba has nocturnal, white, brushlike ﬂowers that, surprisingly, lack nectar, and they are pollinated by a single, large bat species, Phyllostomus hastatus. Although self pollen tubes penetrated ovules with equal facility to cross tubes, fully selfed ﬂowers failed to form fruits. Flowers with mixed (self + cross) pollinations set fewer fruits than those of full crosses, and the fruiting success decreased with self : cross pollen ratio (i.e., 1 : 1 vs. 3 : 1). Fruits from such mixed pollinations contained varying but generally low (mean 3.3%, range 0%–22%) numbers of selfed seed. We conclude that although P. munguba lacks a conventional stigmatic or stylar self-incompatibility mechanism, the combination of exclusive pollination by a wide-ranging bat vector and the death of most selfed ovules provide this species with a highly outcrossing mating system.",

The commercial application of microbial chitinase is appealing due to the relative ease of enormous production and to meet the current world demands. This study aimed at isolation and characterization of chitin degrading bacteria from the gut of Indian tropical insectivorous black‐bearded tomb bat, Taphozous melanopogon. The isolated bacterial strains were characterized through biochemical analysis and nucleic acid‐based approaches by 16S ribosomal RNA amplification and sequencing. The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and phylogenetic analysis showed that the bacterial strain exhibited a close resemblance with Escherichia fergusonii. The chitinolytic activity of the E. fergusonii AMC01 was identified using supplemented colloidal chitin with agar medium. Compiling all, these findings would facilitate in constructing a database and presumably promote the use of E. fergusonii AMC01 as an efficient strain for the chitinase production.",

The former European bat species\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    was split into two,\n                    Pipistrelus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. and\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    , over 20 years ago. However, their distribution, breeding and winter ranges as well as migratory status in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus remained obscure.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  In our study, we scrutinised records of both species and assessed the sex ratio during their breeding season in this region.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We show that\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. has a significantly smaller range than previously assumed, being restricted to the southern part of the study area. On the contrary,\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    has a broader distribution, covering the Caucasus and Eastern Europe, up to ca. 59° N. Hence, all historical records and long‐distance movements of\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    sensu lato from Eastern Europe within the inferred allopatric occurrence of\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    should be attributed to\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The high portion of adult males in breeding localities, mass wintering within the breeding range and lacking evidence of long‐distance seasonal movements imply that\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. is a sedentary species. In\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    , the sex ratio among adults during the breeding season varies latitudinally. The female‐biased sex ratio, absence of mass wintering and the historical long‐distance recoveries of ringed individuals suggest that this species is migratory in Eastern Europe. The male‐biased sex ratio during the breeding season, along with late autumn records, suggests that the Caucasus represents its winter range.",

As the study was carried out in a landscape that was profoundly altered by industrial forestry, we predicted that in a better preserved landscape this species would select smaller feeding areas located at closer distances from the roost, according to the optimal foraging theory, and would use almost exclusively the preferred habitat, i.e., native deciduous woodland. To test these hypotheses, we radiotracked 14 R. euryale from the largest known breeding colony of northern Iberian Peninsula and determined their habitat selection, spatial foraging pattern, and hunting behaviour. Our predictions on habitat selection, as well as on the foraging site size and on commuting range were confirmed. Rhinolophus euryale used almost exclusively native deciduous woodland, and hedgerows were positively selected. We suggest that the richness of tree species in hedgerows provides a high prey availability sustained in time and space. Our findings show that habitat disturbance constitutes a major cause of decline for R. euryale in the study area.",

The bats preferred to forage mainly in pine plantations, riparian woodland, and scrubland, whereas native dehesa (a loose semi-natural oak Quercus rotundifolia and Q. suber woodland) was not exploited as expected. By far the most important prey type for this bat in the Mediterranean were spiders. We conclude that Geoffroy's bat prefers to forage in multistratified dense habitats, even if these include nonnative plantations. The vertical structuring and especially high cover, along with the combination of both parameters are important for this highly manoeuvrable, clutter-tolerant bat. This is valid even when the vertical component is much reduced as occurs in scrubland, in the first succession steps to woodland creation, and in degraded conditions. Under such circumstances, aerial weaving spiders might be detected and captured when lying in their webs. It is likely that dehesa is too loosely wooded to offer suitable characteristics for orb-weaving aerial spiders to build webs, and thus it may not be as attractive for M emarginatus as more dense habitats.",

Currently, this disease is spreading in rural and urban areas of non-endemic regions in Brazil. Recently, bats have gained epidemiological signiﬁcance in leishmaniasis due to its close relationship with human settlements. In this study, we investigated the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in blood samples from 448 bats belonging to four families representing 20 species that were captured in the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba areas of Minas Gerais State (non-endemic areas for leishmaniasis), Brazil. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected in 8·0% of the blood samples, 41·6% of which were Leishmania infantum, 38·9% Leishmania amazonensis and 19·4% Leishmania braziliensis. No positive correlation was found between Leishmania spp. and bat food source. The species with more infection rates were the insectivorous bats Eumops perotis; 22·2% (4/18) of which tested positive for Leishmania DNA. The presence of Leishmania in the bat blood samples, as observed in this study, represents epidemiological importance due to the absence of Leishmaniasis cases in the region.",

They were laparatomized for evaluation of macroscopic characteristics and the digestive tube segments were collected for fixation in 10% neutral formalin for histological processing, after 48 h of fixation. Macroscopically, the digestive tube had an oesophageal segment in the abdominal cavity, with a J-s­ haped saccular stomach, in addition to a small intestine divided into duodenum, jejunum-i­leum and terminal ileum. In the large intestine, an organ dilatation was observed from the small intestine with a one-w­ ay oral-­ aboral ending in the anus, which was called the descending colon. Morphological similarity of the walls of all segments with those of other mammals was observed; however, it presented some peculiarities such as the absence of oesophageal glands, Brunner in the intestine, cecum and appendages. The anatomical disposition and tissue pattern were similar to that found in other insectivorous species. The adaptations of the digestive tube of this species are possibly due to the insectivorous feeding habits, which can be impacted due to anthropic actions in foraging environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Many viruses that cause serious and often fatal disease in humans have spilled over from bats. Recent evidence suggests that stress may enhance virus shedding by bats increasing the possibility of transmission to other species. To understand the reasons for spillover is therefore important to determine the molecular pathways that link stress to virus reactivation and shedding in bats. We recently isolated and characterized a gammaherpesvirus (Eptesicus fuscus herpesvirus, EfHV) autochthonous to North American big brown bats. Since herpesviruses are known to reactivate from latent infections in response to a wide variety of stressors, EfHV presents us with an opportunity to study how physiological, behavioural or environmental changes may influence the big brown bats’ relationship with EfHV. To understand the biology of the virus and how the extended periods of torpor experienced by these bats during hibernation along with the stress of arousal might influence the virus‐host relationship, we attempted to detect the virus in the blood of wild‐caught nonhibernating bats as well as captive bats arising from hibernation. We compared the prevalence of EfHV in the blood (using PCR) and EfHV‐specific antibodies (using ELISA) between captive hibernating bats and wild‐caught non‐hibernating bats. We detected EfHV only in the blood of captive hibernating bats (27.8% = 10/36) and not in wild‐caught non‐hibernating bats (0.0% = 0/43). In contrast, the EfHV‐specific antibody titres were higher in the non‐hibernating bats compared to the hibernating bats. Our study suggests that: (a) viral DNA in blood indicates reactivation from latency, (b) long periods of hibernation lead to suppression of immunity, (c) stress of arousal from hibernation reactivates the virus in bats with lower levels of anti‐viral immunity (indicated by humoral immune response), and (d) levels of anti‐viral immunity increase in non‐hibernating bats following reactivation.",

The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites.\n            \n            \n              2\n              Hand pollination experiments showed\n              S. siamensis\n              to be partially self‐incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit.\n            \n            \n              3\n              Shorea siamensis\n              was pollinated by small\n              Trigona\n              bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites.\n            \n            \n              4\n              At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected.\n            \n            \n              5\n              Our results suggest that high reproductive success of\n              S. siamensis\n              is dependent upon cross‐pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The cranial osteology of the megachiropteran Pteropus brisson, 1762, was the subject of recent study that covered all of the skull bones in significant detail, except for the anatomy of the nasal capsule. here, we describe and illustrate the internal nasal skeleton of Pteropus lylei k. andersen, 1908, using histological sections of a fetus and high resolution X-ray computed tomographic (hRXCT) imagery of an adult specimen. The internal nasal skeleton of Pteropus lacks a rostral nasoturbinal and includes a caudal nasoturbinal that corresponds to the ossified crista semicircularis of the fetus; three endoturbinals; one ectoturbinal; the maxilloturbinal; and a low basal crest that may represent a rudimentary element. We describe in detail the structure and connections of these elements in Pteropus. The maxilloturbinal is the largest element. In cross section, the caudal nasoturbinal is unilaminar, the maxilloturbinal is double bilaminar (i.e., each of the basal twin laminae splits further into two secondary laminae), and the other elements range from incipient to asymmetrically double bilaminar (i.e., one branch simple, the other split). all turbinals of the ethmoidal labyrinth contribute to the cribriform plate, creating a specific pattern of cribriform foramina. The elements found in Pteropus are compared with those of other well-known mammals with relatively few turbinal elements, including other bats, primates, canids, and marsupials. We show that, despite terminological discrepancies across studies, homologies are straightforward to establish among these taxa and so comparative or phylogenetic studies may benefit from inclusion of turbinal characters.",

This tick feeds nearly exclusively on bats in nature. Several inhabitants of infested homes complained of “bug bites” at night while asleep that may have resulted in erythematous, edematous, urticaric skin lesions and constitutional signs and symptoms. We provide laboratory evidence that a single, engorged C. kelleyi nymph contained host blood from a human female. The clinical implications of our Þndings are intriguing but unclear.",

Although some aspects of emergence behavior are understood, one previously unexplored area is the specific order in which individuals emerge. The goal of our research was to determine if big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, fitted with passive integrated transponder tags emerge from roosts in buildings each evening in a nonrandom order. We assessed relative and absolute order of emergence to determine if order is concordant across nights and whether individuals consistently emerge in close association with specific roost mates. We found significant concordance in rank order among nights at all roosts. At 5 roosts concordance decreased as time between dates increased. Association rates between individuals were low, and temporal analyses revealed that associations rapidly degraded over time, indicating that bats do not emerge each evening consistently with the same group of roost mates. We discuss how social structure, information transfer, and/or individual energetic needs could be responsible for the observed nonrandom patterns of emergence. Our results suggest that emergence order represents behavioral information that traditionally has been overlooked and that might be useful for characterizing aspects of the ecology and social behavior of bats and other species with cryptic behavior.",

They are highly diverse, with physiological and behavioral adaptations which allow them to extend their distributions into temperate areas. In Patagonia, this family is represented by seven species in three genera (Histiotus, Lasiurus and Myotis). In this study, we analyzed the distribution of two vespertilionid species, Lasiurus villosissimus and Myotis dinellii, including new southernmost records, and their relationship with environmental variables. Two different spatial scales were analyzed: a continental approach for species distribution analyses (South America), and local trapping of bats in northwestern Chubut province, Argentina. We present new southern limits for L. villosissimus and M. dinellii, and included new records for Patagonian bats. The big hoary bat L. villosissimus was recorded as the largest bat inhabiting Patagonia, relating it as a bat mainly inhabiting low, humid and temperate/warm areas. The little yellow bat M. dinellii, instead, is the smallest mammal and the smallest bat recorded in Patagonia to date, related mainly with dry, mid-altitude and temperate/warm areas.",

However, the presence of cryptic strategies often results in situations where social mating system is not reflective of genetic mating system. We present such a study of the genetic mating system of a harem-forming bat Cynopterus sphinx where harems may not be true indicators of male reproductive success. This temporal study using data from six seasons on paternity reveals that social harem assemblages do not play a role in the mating system, and variance in male reproductive success is lower than expected assuming polygynous mating. Further, simulations reveal that the genetic mating system is statistically indistinguishable from promiscuity. Our results are in contrast to an earlier study that demonstrated high variance in male reproductive success. Although an outcome of behavioural mating patterns, standardized variance in male reproductive success (Im) affects the opportunity for sexual selection. To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary implications of promiscuity for mammals in general, we compared our estimates of Im and total opportunity for sexual selection (Im ⁄ If, where If is standardized variance in female reproductive success) with those of other known promiscuous species. We observed a broad range of Im ⁄ If values across known promiscuous species, indicating our poor understanding of the evolutionary implications of promiscuous mating.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are social animals and display a diverse variety of mating and social systems, with most species exhibiting some form of polygyny. Their social organization is fluid and individuals frequently switch partners and roosting sites. While harem-like social organization is observed in multiple tropical species, its importance is contested in many of them. In this study, we investigated the role of harems in the social organization of the old world fruit bat\n              Cynopterus sphinx\n              . Based on regular behavioural observations over a period of 20 months and genetic data from microsatellite markers, we observed that the social organization is flexible, individuals regularly shift between roosts and the social organization resembles a fission–fusion society. Behavioural and genetic analyses suggest that the harems are not strict units of social structure, and the colony does not show signatures of subdivision with harems as behavioural units. We also observed that there was no correlation between individuals with high association index and pairwise relatedness. Our findings indicate that similar to the mating system, the social organization of\n              C. sphinx\n              can also be categorized as a fission–fusion society, and hence the term ‘harem’ is a misnomer. We conclude that the social system of\n              C. sphinx\n              is flexible, with multi-male multi-female organization, and individuals tend to be loyal to a given area rather than a roost.",

Our study deals with social call structure of a recently discovered species, Pipistrellus hanaki. Because it shares a common ancestor with P. pygmaeus, we hypothesized that as in the other species from this group social call structure in P. hanaki retains the basic design observed in other bats from the same genus. We also hypothesized that as in other pipistrelles such calls fulfill context-dependent functions, being used by both foraging and mating bats for different purposes. However, we found that these calls have a structure rather different from that seen in most pipistrelles. Two different types of multi-harmonic, broad-band and long-duration social calls were identified, with distinctive temporal structures. Single component, frequency modulated-quasi constant frequency (FM-QCF) calls were emitted during summer at foraging sites where feeding buzzes were regularly produced. In autumn, when feeding buzz rates decreased and males caught at recording sites had prominent testes, a second type of single or multi-component calls with a fluctuating frequency over time was more frequent. Unlike the typical multi-component social calls recorded in several Pipistrellus species, our results suggest that social calls used by foraging or mating P. hanaki have markedly different structures. Because social calls of bats are speciesspecific and may function in reproductive isolation, we hypothesize that differentiation of social calls in P. hanaki has been associated with the divergence of this species from P. pygmaeus.",

Considering the microbiota–host as a unity, in which extrinsic (as food availability and geography) or intrinsic factors (as physiology) play an important role in the microbiota composition, we would expect differentiation in the microbiota of two geographically separated populations. The Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASVs) of the V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene from 68 individuals were analyzed using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We obtained a total of 11 566 (ASVs). The bacterial communities in the Central and Pacific populations had a diversity of 6,939 and 4,088 ASVs, respectively, sharing a core microbiota of 539 ASVs accounting for 75% of the relative abundance, suggesting stability over evolutionary time. The Weighted UniFrac metrics tested by a PERMANOVA showed that lactating and pregnant females had significant beta diversity differences in the two populations compared with other reproductive stages. This could be a consequence of the increased energy requirements of these physiological stages, more than the variation due to geographical separation. In contrast, a positive correlation of the observed ASVs of fecal microbiota with the observed ASVs of plastids related to the diet was observed in the juveniles and adults, suggesting that in these physiological stages an extrinsic factor as the diet shapes the microbiota composition. The results provide a baseline for future studies of the microbiome in these two wild populations of the lesser long-nosed bat, the main pollinator of the Agaves from which the beverages tequila and mezcal are made.",

This has led to uncertainties about the distribution of the species, that was once considered an Atlantic Forest endemic. Based on an analysis of a large and geographically restricted series of P. recifinus, we assessed the individual variation in the species and provide useful characters to separate it from P. lineatus. We reviewed the locality records of P. recifinus, and carried out an ecological niche model analysis in order to update the species polygon and calculate its area of habitat. After removing misidentifications, we found that the species occurs in moist forests from sea level to 1653 m. The area of suitable habitat estimated for the species was 402,225.2 Km2, ranging from the Brazilian states of Ceará to Santa Catarina. Both empirical records and ecological niche model analyses reinforce that P. recifinus should be considered an Atlantic Forest endemic. The species is present in moist forest enclaves in the Caatinga, but these formations are part of the Atlantic Forest domain.",

Here, using footage from a high-speed camera, the first comparative study of the performance during the wing induced phase of take-off in six insectivorous bat species is described. Despite distinct differences in foraging strategy, the mass specific power generated by the bats during wing induced take-off did not differ between species, with the exception of Myotis capaccinii. This suggests that differences in take-off performance may only be evident in bats that exhibit particularly unusual foraging strategies, such as the trawling behaviour of M. capaccinii – with differences in the remaining species only manifesting in subtler aspects of flight performance such as agility or manoeuvrability. The poorer take-off performance of M. capaccinii could be related to either a reduction in wing-stroke amplitude to stop the wings hitting the water’s surface during foraging or perhaps an effect of having very large feet. No scaling relationship between body mass and mass-specific take-off power was found, which supports earlier research on birds and insects, suggesting that the mass-specific muscle power available for flight is broadly similar across a large range of body sizes and species.",

The work detailed in this article tested whether pups learn about novel food from interactions with their mothers during foraging and develop preferences. Mother-pup pairs or pups alone were trained during postnatal days (PND) 46–50 using Mangifera indica as a novel fruit. They were then tested during PND 61–65 for food preferences in relation to a known fruit (Achras sapota) and the novel fruit (M. indica). When the trained pups and untrained pups were tested for food preferences independently, those trained with the mother were found to exhibit significantly more marked preferences for the novel fruit as compared with either the pups trained without their mothers or the untrained pups. They made a greater number of feeding attempts and bouts in respect of the novel fruit. However, pups trained without their mothers and untrained pups also both showed a response to the novel fruit during the later period of testing. The results suggest that mother-pup interactions during the early foraging period may provide an opportunity for C. sphinx pups to learn about novel food sources thanks to their mother. Later they may learn independently on the basis of experience from mother’s milk and/or social interaction with conspecifics.",

            "abstractNote": "Age-related telomere shortening is considered a hallmark of the ageing process. However, a recent cross-sectional ageing study of relative telomere length (rTL) in bats failed to detect a relationship between rTL and age in the long-lived genus Myotis (M. myotis and M. bechsteinii), suggesting some other factors are responsible for driving telomere dynamics in these species. Here, we test if longitudinal rTL data show signatures of age-associated telomere attrition in M. myotis and differentiate which intrinsic or extrinsic factors are likely to drive telomere length dynamics. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, rTL was measured in 504 samples from a marked population, from Brittany, France, captured between 2013 and 2016. These represent 174 individuals with an age range of 0 to 7+ years. We find no significant relationship between rTL and age (p = .762), but demonstrate that within-individual rTL is highly variable from year to year. To investigate the heritability of rTL, a population pedigree (n = 1744) was constructed from genotype data generated from a 16-microsatellite multiplex, designed from an initial, low-coverage, Illumina genome for M. myotis. Heritability was estimated in a Bayesian, mixed model framework, and showed that little of the observed variance in rTL is heritable (h2 = 0.01–0.06). Rather, correlations of first differences, correlating yearly changes in telomere length and weather variables, demonstrate that, during the spring transition, average temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall and windspeed correlate with changes in longitudinal telomere dynamics. As such, rTL may represent a useful biomarker to quantify the physiological impact of various environmental stressors in bats.",

Many previous studies have concentrated on the importance of diurnal visitors in pollination, and consequently, information on the contribution of nocturnal visitors to pollination in early spring is limited. This study was conducted to evaluate the relative importance of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators in the early spring flowering dioecious shrub Stachyurus praecox (Stachyuraceae), in two temperate forests in central Japan. Visitors to the female and male flowers were observed during day and night, and their relative contributions to seed set were compared. The pollinator observations revealed that the diurnal and nocturnal insects visited both male and female flowers, and that the main flower visitors were diurnal small bees and flies as well as nocturnal settling moths. The diurnal and nocturnal flower visitors also acted as pollinators, as the pollen grains of S. praecox were attached to the insects collected from the female flowers. Pollination experiments demonstrated that the contributions of diurnal pollinators to the seed set were higher than those of the nocturnal pollinators. The results of this study indicate that S. praecox has a generalized pollination system, comprising both diurnal insects and nocturnal settling moths. Although the roles of diurnal insects are more important in the pollination of S. praecox, nocturnal settling moths may have a complementary role in early spring.",

The North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) aims to use its technology infrastructure to assess status and trends of bat populations, while developing innovative and community‐driven conservation solutions.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Here, we present\n                    NABat ML\n                    , an automated machine‐learning algorithm that improves the scalability and scientific transparency of NABat acoustic monitoring. This model combines signal processing techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify recorded bat echolocation calls. We developed our CNN model with internet‐based computing resources (‘cloud environment’), and trained it on >600,000 spectrogram images. We also incorporated species range maps to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model for future ‘unseen’ data. We evaluated model performance using a comprehensive, independent, holdout dataset.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    NABat ML\n                    successfully distinguished 31 classes (30 species and a noise class) with overall weighted‐average accuracy and precision rates of 92%, and ≥90% classification accuracy for 19 of the bat species. Using a single cloud‐environment computing instance, the entire model training process took <16 h.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Our convolutional neural network (CNN)‐based model,\n                    NABat ML\n                    , classifies 30 North American bat species using their recorded echolocation calls with an overall accuracy of 92%. In addition to providing highly accurate species‐level classification,\n                    NABat ML\n                    and its outputs are compatible with Bayesian and other statistical techniques for measuring uncertainty in classification. Our model is open‐source and reproducible, enabling future implementations as software on end‐user devices and cloud‐based web applications. These qualities make\n                    NABat ML\n                    highly suitable for applications ranging from grassroots community science initiatives to big‐data methods developed and implemented by researchers and professional practitioners. We believe the transparency and accessibility of\n                    NABat ML\n                    will encourage broad‐scale participation in bat monitoring, and enable development of innovative solutions needed to conserve North American bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Behavioural plasticity is a critical component of natural selection leading to evolution. However, a surge of studies in the last two decades has discovered a distinct limit to behavioural plasticity, commonly referred to as behaviour types and behavioural syndromes. We set out to understand the relationships across behavioural categories in wild-caught adult, female big brown bats and how they compare between social and solitary behaviours. Using bats sampled from four different maternity colonies, we ran a series of behavioural assays to create a behavioural proﬁle for each individual. The behavioural proﬁle encompassed exploratory, learning, competitive and aggressive categories. We found that Big brown bats exhibit a mean proﬁle relatively unique to other well-documented species, where aggression was linked to increased competitive ability but not to boldness. Our results indicate that the solitary and socially directed behaviours of individuals are not necessarily related and that behaviours pertaining to social interactions are linked most closely to learning abilities. Furthermore, we found evidence that poor body condition may be a predictor of increased social interactions and that behaviours exhibited in the presence of conspeciﬁcs are unrelated to those exhibited in solitude. These ﬁndings indicate importance of social afﬁliations on individual behaviours in this species and their uniqueness relative to other well-studied taxa.",

            "abstractNote": "Among social species, iterative interactions may lead to social preferences among group-mates and often are associated with increased mating opportunities or improved indirect ﬁtness beneﬁts. Although preferential associations have been documented in multiple species, this phenomenon has never been empirically studied in bats—the second largest order of mammals, where many of the 1200+ species live in groups of tens to hundreds of individuals. Given the current understanding of the social behaviour exhibited in this species, we explored the possibility that adult female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus (Beauvois, 1796)) show preferential association between group-mates using a pairwise choice design with individuals from a captive colony. Focal individuals were placed in a Y-maze and were given free choice of two familiar conspeciﬁcs. We measured the time focal individuals spent in close proximity to each conspeciﬁc. Our results indicate that some bats exhibit preferential association between group-mates, as multiple individuals spent signiﬁcantly more time in close proximity to one conspeciﬁc versus another, despite randomizing the position of stimulus bats between trials. Given the frequent and long-term associations between group members of this species, social preferences could play a signiﬁcant role in the outcomes of their long-term ﬁtness.",

All but one case received treatment with a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and, or pimobendan. One case is still under treatment with pimobendan alone, following diagnosis before onset of clinical signs. Diuretic treatment consisted of furosemide at a dose rate of 0.5–5 mg/kg, one to three times daily, and, or spironolactone at a dose rate of 1–4 mg/kg, once or twice daily. When used, the ACEI imidapril was given at a dose rate of 0.24–0.38 mg/kg q 24 hr, and pimobendan at a dose rate of 0.2–0.5 mg/kg bid. This report is intended to provide anyone seeking to medically manage heart failure in Pteropus species, particularly P. livingstonii, with a review of drugs and doses that have been used.",

Our observation corroborates earlier evidence that bats and Common Nighthawks both exploit the foraging opportunity created by artificial lights. Because the monument provided spatial perspective, we were also able to observe that bats and Common Nighthawks foraged at different heights, suggesting that they partitioned the available foraging space vertically.",

The capacity to survive infections\n of highly pathogenic agents without severe disease, together with many other unique features, makes bats an ideal animal model for studying the regulation of infection, cancer, and longevity, which is likely to translate into human health outcomes. A key factor that limits bat research is\n lack of breeding bat colonies. To address this need, a captive bat colony was established in Singapore from 19 wild-caught local cave nectar bats. The bats were screened for specific pathogens before the start of captive breeding. Custom-made cages and an optimized diet inclusive of Wombaroo\n dietary formula, liquid diet, and supplement of fruits enabled the bats to breed prolifically in our facility. Cages are washed daily and disinfected once every fortnight. Bats are observed daily to detect any sick bat or abnormal behavior. In addition, bats undergo a thorough health check\n once every 3 to 4 mo to check on their overall wellbeing, perform sampling, and document any potential pregnancy. The current colony houses over 80 bats that are successfully breeding, providing a valuable resource for research in Singapore and overseas.",

            "abstractNote": "Two common bat lyssavirus species have been identiﬁed in many European countries: European bat lyssavirus type-1 and -2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2). Only limited knowledge on the susceptibility of the natural EBLV-hosts, insectivorous bats, to lyssavirus infection is available. Our study was undertaken to evaluate the susceptibility and pathology associated with an EBLV-1 infection in Eptesicus fuscus following different routes of virus inoculation including intracranial (n = 6), intramuscular (n = 14), oral (n = 7) and intranasal (n = 7). Blood and saliva samples were collected from all bats on a monthly basis. Four bats inoculated intracranially developed rabies with a mean of 11 days to death, whilst seven bats inoculated intramuscularly developed rabies, with an extended incubation period prior to death. We did not observe any mortality in the oral (p.o.) or intranasal (i.n.) groups and both groups had detectable levels of virus neutralizing antibodies (data not shown). Virus shedding was demonstrated in the saliva by virus isolation and the detection of viral RNA in ill bats, particularly immediately prior to the development of disease. In addition, the presence of virus and viral RNA was detected in the thyroid gland in bats challenged experimentally with EBLV-1, which exceeded that detected in all other extraneural tissue. The signiﬁcance of detecting EBLV-1 in the thyroid gland of rabid bats is not well understood. We speculate that the infection of the thyroid gland may cause subacute thyroiditis, a transient form of thyroiditis causing hyperthyroidism, resulting in changes in adrenocortical activity that could lead to hormonal dysfunction, thereby distinguishing the clinical presentation of rabies in the rabid host.",

Aerial feeders have small hind feet, short calcars, short ears, and narrow tragi. Gleaners have small hind feet, long ears, and wide tragi and tend to be larger in body size. Bats that feed over water have large hind feet, short calcars, short ears, and narrow tragi and tend to be smaller in body size. Trawlers have large hind feet and long calcars and tend to be larger in body size. The morphometric analysis also confirmed that some species of Myotis were intermediate in morphological features, coinciding with alternation between foraging styles. The results support the view that the morphological features previously used to assign Myotis species to subgenera are more functional than phylogenetic, a position supported by recent genetic analyses. Examination of foraging styles from a phylogenetic perspective suggests that aerial feeding is ancestral and that subsequent diversification has been associated with partitioning and specialization into either gleaning or foraging over water and trawling. When the predictions from the multivariate analysis of the data for the genus Myotis are used with data from other bats, they suggest that 5 species of Nycteris are gleaners, while 11 species of Eptesicus are either aerial feeders or feed over water.",

            "abstractNote": "General insights into the causes and effects of social structure can be gained from comparative analyses across socially and ecologically diverse taxa, such as bats, but long-term data are lacking for most species. In the neotropical fringe-lipped bat,\n              Trachops cirrhosus\n              , social transmission of foraging behaviour is clearly demonstrated in captivity, yet its social structure in the wild remains unclear. Here, we used microsatellite-based estimates of relatedness and records of 157 individually marked adults from 106 roost captures over 6 years, to infer whether male and female\n              T. cirrhosus\n              have preferred co-roosting associations and whether such associations were influenced by relatedness. Using a null model that controlled for year and roosting location, we found that both male and female\n              T. cirrhosus\n              have preferred roosting partners, but that only females demonstrate kin-biased association. Most roosting groups (67%) contained multiple females with one or two reproductive males. Relatedness patterns and recapture records corroborate genetic evidence for female philopatry and male dispersal. Our study adds to growing evidence that many bats demonstrate preferred roosting associations, which has the potential to influence social information transfer.",

Multiple analyses of call features, including duration (ms), lowest frequency (kHz), highest frequency (kHz) and frequency with most energy (kHz), indicated signiﬁcant inter-individual variation. Discriminant function analysis of call features correctly classiﬁed the calls of individuals from four roosts > 70% on 19 of 28 times. Although other species of molossids (Chaerephon pumilus, Tadarida aegyptiaca, and one unidentiﬁed species) produced social calls as well as frequency-modulated sweep calls, O. martiensseni produced just the latter vocalizations and they were longer and lower in frequency than those of the sympatric molossids. Other species of molossids, but not O. martiensseni, produced feeding buzzes as they attacked ﬂying insects. The frequency-modulated sweep calls of O. martiensseni seem to serve a communication function, but they may not be used in echolocation unlike similar calls by other molossids. Individually distinct communication signals (frequency-modulated sweep calls) enhance communication in a species that lives in year-round social groups (one adult male, females and dependent young).",

This is unfortunate because the use of markers with contrasting modes of inheritance and rates of evolution might provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of a species’ history. Here we present a detailed study of the phylogeography of the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, using 1098 bp of the mitochondrial ND2 gene from 45 localities from across its Palaearctic range to infer population history. In addition, we re-analysed a large microsatellite data set available for this species and compared the results of both markers to infer population relationships and the historical processes influencing them. We show that mtDNA, the most popular marker in phylogeography studies, yielded a misleading result, and would have led us to conclude erroneously that a single expansion had taken place in Europe. Only by combining the mitochondrial and microsatellite data sets are we able to reconstruct the species’ history and show two colonization events in Europe, one before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and one after it. Combining markers also revealed the importance of Asia Minor as an ancient refugium for this species and a source population for the expansion of the greater horseshoe bat into Europe before the LGM.",

We recorded auditory receptor cell action potentials elicited in underwing moths (Catocala spp.) by echolocation calls emitted during gleaning attacks by Myotis septentrionalis (the northern long-eared bat) and during ﬂights by the aerial hawker Myotis lucifugus (the little brown bat). The moth ear responds inconsistently and with fewer action potentials to the echolocation calls emitted by the gleaner, a situation that worsened when the moth’s ear was covered by its wing (mimicking a moth resting on a surface). Calls emitted by the aerial-hawking bat elicited a signiﬁcantly stronger spiking response from the moth ear. Moths with their ears covered by their wings maintained their relative hearing sensitivity at their best frequency range, the range used by most aerial insectivorous bats, but showed a pronounced deafness in the frequency range typically employed by gleaning bats. Our results (1) support the prediction that the echolocation calls of gleaners are acoustically inconspicuous to the ears of moths (and presumably other nocturnal tympanate insects), leaving the moths particularly vulnerable to predation, and (2) suggest that gleaners gain a foraging advantage against eared prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Echolocating bats are exposed not only to the echoes of their own calls, but often the signals of conspecifics and other bats. For species emitting short, frequency modulated signals (e.g. vespertilionoids), adjustments in both the frequency and time domain have been observed in such situations. However, bats using long duration, constant frequency calls may confront special challenges, since these bats should be less able to avoid temporal and frequency overlap. Here we investigated echolocation call design in the high-duty cycle bat, Rhinolophus capensis, as bats flew with either a conspecific or heterospecific in a large outdoor flight-room. We compared these recordings to those made of bats flying alone in the same flight-room, and in a smaller flight room, alone, and hunting tethered moths. We found no differences in duty cycle or peak frequency of the calls of R. capensis across conditions. However, in the presence of a conspecific or the vespertilionoid, Miniopterus natalensis, R. capensis produced longer frequency-modulated downward sweeps at the terminus of their calls with lower minimum frequencies than when flying alone. In the presence of the larger high-duty cycle bat, R. clivosus, R. capensis produced shorter calls than when flying alone or with a conspecific. These changes are similar to those of vespertilionoids when flying from open to more cluttered environments. They are not similar to those differences observed in vespertilionoids when flying with other bats. Also unlike vespertilinoids, R. capensis used calls 15 dB less intense in conspecific pairs than when alone.",

Prior to the discovery of the bats in 1987, the house was broken into regularly and disturbance levels were quite high. Upon discovery of the roost, the house was fortified and vandalism was greatly reduced. The number of females and the number of volant young greatly increased during our study and was directly correlated with the decline in vandalism. Bats emerged from the house 43.6 (± 10.9 SD) min after local sunset. Bats emerged later in the evening during spring and fall, when it was warmer, and when it was windier. We also evaluated duration of emergence (47.11 [45.0–49.7] min), and seasonal patterns of re-entry into the roost. Several factors suggested that potential predation, most likely by owls, influenced both the timing and duration of evening emergences.",

However, little is known concerning how intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect animal daily rhythms in the field, especially in nocturnal animals. Here, we investigated the first emergence, mid-­emergence, and return times of Vespertilio sinensis, and also integrated environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) and biotic factors (reproductive status and predation risk) to determine causes of variation in the activity rhythms of the bats. We found that variation in the first emergence time, the mid-­emergence time, and the final return time were distinct. The results demonstrated that the emergence and return times of bats were affected by light intensity, reproductive status, and predation risk in a relatively complex pattern. Light intensity had the greatest contribution to activity rhythms. Moreover, we first investigated the effects of actual predators on the activity rhythms of bats; the results showed that the mid-­emergence time of bats was earlier as predators were hunting, but the final return time was later when predators were present. Finally, our results also highlighted the importance of higher energy demands during the lactation in bats to variation in activity rhythms. These results improve our understanding of the patterns and causes of variation in activity rhythms in bats and other nocturnal animals.",

In the dry season, males show simultaneous testis regression and sperm storage in cauda epididymis, enabling them to mate during this season. In this study, we investigated seasonal variations in body mass, diameter and height of seminiferous tubules and nuclei of Leydig cells in a population of southeastern Brazil. We also determined the frequencies of the stages of the seminiferous epithelium cycle (SEC) of mature individuals of this population. Body mass and diameter of Leydig cell nuclei showed no signiﬁcant differences between dry and rainy seasons and stages of annual reproductive cycle; however, all other morphometric parameters varied signiﬁcantly. The relative cumulative frequency of pre-meiotic stages of the SEC (1–3) was 51%, of meiotic stage (4) was 2% and of post-meiotic stages (5–8) was 47%. We conﬁrmed that the yellowish myotis presents seasonal sperm production as revealed by testis regression and epididymal sperm storage during the dry season.",

The colony was monitored each month from November 2014 to December 2015 with 154 males and 117 females captured. Testicular and ovarian histological data from 31 adult males and 22 adult females were obtained. Body condition index of male and female, and gonadosomatic index, epididymis-somatic index and Sertoli cell efficiency were analyzed. Females with spermatozoa in uterine crypts, embryos in oviducts, gravid uteri, and pregnant females were registered during the rainy season (November–March) and into the beginning of the following dry season (April), indicating asynchrony of births. The ovaries showed all types of ovarian follicles, and a polarized ovary cortex was found, differing from the organization pattern of most mammals. The testes showed continuous spermatic activity, but testicular parameters analyzed showed significantly higher values during the rainy season. A shorter mating period during the beginning of this season was detected, when values of the gonadosomatic and epididymis-somatic indexes, and Sertoli cell efficiency showed more pronounced differences in relation to the remaining period of study. Unlike polyestry known for some Neotropical phyllostomids, the reproductive cycle of A. geoffroyi was characterized as seasonal monoestrous, with the main reproductive events occurring during the rainy season, as the best time for females to reproduce, but with offspring recruitment occurring predominantly during the dry season, a period with fewer food resources.",

Males of some species may change tactics depending on age, body condition and social environment. Many bat species are polygynous where a fraction of males only have access to fertile females. For polygynous bats, knowledge of the reproductive success of males using different ARTs is scarce, and it remains unclear how age of males is related to switching decisions between social statuses. We studied a large captive population of Carollia perspicillata, where males are either harem holders, bachelors or peripheral males. Using a multistate procedure, we modelled the age-related switches in reproductive tactics and in survival probability. From the model, we calculated the reproductive success and the frequencies of males displaying different reproductive tactics. As in mammals, the switch between social statuses is often related to age, we predicted that the transition probability of bachelor and peripheral males to harem status would increase with age. We show, however, that social status transition towards a harem holding position was not related to age. Reproductive success changed with age and social status. Harem males had a signiﬁcantly higher reproductive success than bachelor males except between a short period from 3.8 to 4.4 years of age where success was similar, and a signiﬁcantly higher reproductive success than peripheral males between 2.6 and 4.4 years of age. Harem males showed a clear decrease in the probability of maintaining social status with age, which suggests that senescence reduces resource holding potential.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats of the genus Sturnira (Family Phyllostomidae) are characterised by shoulder glands that are more developed in reproductively mature adult males. The glands produce a waxy secretion that accumulates on the fur around the gland, dyeing the fur a dark colour and giving off a pungent odour. These shoulder glands are thought to play a role in their reproductive behaviour. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, we analysed solvent extracts of fur surrounding the shoulder gland in the northern-shouldered bat, Sturnira parvidens to (i) characterise the chemical composition of shoulder gland secretions for the ﬁrst time, and (ii) look for differences in chemical composition among and between adult males, sub-adult/juvenile males and adult females. Fur solvent extracts were analysed as liquids and also further extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction to identify volatile components in the odour itself. Odour ﬁngerprint analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling plots and multivariate analysis revealed clear and signiﬁcant differences (P < 0.001) between adult males vs both juvenile males and adult females. The chemical components of the shoulder gland secretion included terpenes and phenolics, together with alcohols and esters, most likely derived from the frugivorous diet of the bat. Many of the compounds identiﬁed were found exclusively or in elevated quantities among adult (reproductive) males compared with adult females and non-reproductive (juvenile) males. This strongly suggests a speciﬁc role in male–female attraction although a function in male–male competition and/or species recognition is also possible.",

Current lack of knowledge about the roosting ecology of these species in boreal forest limits our understanding of how they may be affected by logging. The main objective was to identify tree and forest stand features that were selected by bats for roosting within a balsam ﬁr (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) – paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall) forest of Quebec, Canada. Over 3 years, we captured and ﬁtted radio transmitters to 22 individual bats to locate their roost trees for 7–14 days following release. We measured tree and forest stand features in the ﬁeld and using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology. Roost trees were compared with random trees using generalized linear mixed models. Male Myotis bats selected larger and taller snags, within stands containing a higher proportion of canopy gaps and a larger number of snags compared with random trees. Vegetation clumps of 0.1 ha containing a minimum of 10 snags with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm should be maintained to preserve roosting habitat that is used by male Myotis bats in balsam ﬁr – paper birch forests.",

This species is not federally protected, but receives legal protection in many states, including Tennessee. Additional information on the species, particularly its summer roosting ecology, is needed to inform appropriate management and conservation planning. While conducting a summer survey of multiple bat species using buildings as roosts in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, we discovered Eastern Small-footed Myotis roosting in 3 historic buildings on the northwest slope of Mount LeConte. At least 1 building contained a maternity colony. Humans used all 3 buildings on a daily basis.",
