This framework encapsulates the key elements of any problem, including the objective, the constraints, and knowledge of the system. Within the context of this framework the broad array of approaches for setting conservation priorities are reviewed. While some approaches prioritize assets or locations for conservation investment, it is concluded here that prioritization is incomplete without consideration of the conservation actions required to conserve the assets at particular locations. The challenges associated with prioritizing investments through time in the face of threats (and also spatially and temporally heterogeneous costs) can be aided by proper problem definition. Using the authors’ general framework for setting conservation priorities, multiple criteria can be rationally integrated and where, how, and when to invest conservation resources can be scheduled. Trade‐offs are unavoidable in priority setting when there are multiple considerations, and budgets are almost always finite. The authors discuss how trade‐offs, risks, uncertainty, feedbacks, and learning can be explicitly evaluated within their generic framework for setting conservation priorities. Finally, they suggest ways that current priority‐setting approaches may be improved.",

            "abstractNote": "The ability to predict the responses of ecological communities and individual species to human-induced environmental change remains a key issue for ecologists and conservation managers alike. Responses are often variable among species within groups making general predictions difﬁcult. One option is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this ‘‘trait-guild” approach has been used for single disturbances, the importance of particular traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural intensiﬁcation, pesticides and ﬁre. Individual traits signiﬁcantly affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests – above vs. below ground – signiﬁcantly affected response to habitat loss, agricultural intensiﬁcation, tillage regime (within agriculture) and ﬁre. Species that nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In contrast below-ground-nesting species were more negatively affected by tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response of different nesting guilds to ﬁre depended on the time since the burn. Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body size did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in determining many aspects of individuals’ interaction with their environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored, individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of related species to global change.",

            "abstractNote": "The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae), represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-­needed standardization for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a 387 nt region of the coronavirus RNA-d­ ependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with whole-g­ enome analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses are sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-­level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, MyCoV, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.",

One such measure that is important to consider is the age of an individual. We tested whether baseline or stressinduced corticosterone levels vary with age in free-living Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) during the pre-breeding period. Corticosterone (CORT), the primary avian stress hormone, is released in response to stressful stimuli, and stimulates gluconeogenesis; however, it also serves as a chemical messenger that can inﬂuence other physiological processes, reproduction, and behavior. We monitored both baseline CORT levels longitudinally throughout a ﬁve-year period and stress-induced CORT responses over a shorter two-year period. We predicted that older jays would have lower baseline CORT levels and a dampened stress response compared to younger birds, as has been shown in other avian species. We found no signiﬁcant differences in baseline CORT levels with age. We found a decrease in total corticosterone responses to a stressor with age, however, the oldest birds in the population showed greater total corticosterone responses to a stressor. These results may be a product of age-related changes in physiological processes related to the stress response or a result of selection acting on the population, resulting in only the most responsive individuals surviving to old age.",

            "abstractNote": "It is widely accepted that elevated nitrogen deposition can have detrimental effects on semi-natural ecosystems, including changes to plant diversity. Empirical critical loads of nutrient nitrogen have been recommended to protect many sensitive European habitats from signiﬁcant harmful effects. In this study, we used Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) to investigate shifts in vegetation communities along an atmospheric nitrogen deposition gradient for twenty-two semi-natural habitat types (as described under Annex I of the European Union Habitats Directive) in Ireland. Signiﬁcant changes in vegetation community, i.e., change points, were determined for twelve habitats, with seven habitats showing a decrease in the number of positive indicator species. Community-level change points indicated a decrease in species abundance along a nitrogen deposition gradient ranging from 3.9 to 15.3 kg N haÀ1 yrÀ1, which were signiﬁcantly lower than recommended critical loads (Wilcoxon signedrank test; V ¼ 6, p < 0.05). These results suggest that lower critical loads of empirical nutrient nitrogen deposition may be required to protect many European habitats. Changes to vegetation communities may mean a loss of sensitive indicator species and potentially rare species in these habitats, highlighting how emission reductions policies set under the National Emissions Ceilings Directive may be directly linked to meeting the goal set out under the European Union’s Biodiversity Strategy of “halting the loss of biodiversity” across Europe by 2020.",

            "abstractNote": "We have the knowledge and tools to eliminate the threat of canine rabies but this disease, nevertheless, remains a public health threat in many parts of the world. Lack of motivation by governments, cultural issues and inadequate funding remain barriers. This is amazing since the number of human rabies deaths worldwide is greater than that from polio, meningococcal meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, SARS, bird ﬂue and other scourges that attract more attention. Safe and effective vaccines are now widely available. Reduced dose effective and less expensive post-exposure vaccination regimens have helped eliminate nerve tissue vaccines in Thailand, Philippines and Sri Lanka. India and Pakistan, the major users of dangerous nerve tissue derived Semple type vaccine, are now considering following suite. Immediate wound care and prompt use of a potent vaccine will save a majority of infected persons. Rabies immunoglobulin, injected into and around bite wounds, provides added safety for the severely exposed. The high cost of rabies immunoglobulin and tissue culture vaccines are remaining barriers, but new manufacturers and the use of intradermal vaccination schedules can reduce costs. Ultimately, it is the need to control rabies in dogs that must occupy most of our attention. The tools are available, but attitudes must change before they can be applied. There have been many new developments since publication of the last WHO rabies expert committee report in 1992 [WHO Expert Committee on Rabies. Eighth Report. Tech Series 824. Geneva: World Health Organization; 1992 (new version in print)] and we will address those that have practical applicability.",

            "abstractNote": "A conference entitled ‘2nd International Berlin Bat Meeting: Bat Biology and Infectious Diseases’ was held between the 19 and 21 of February 2010 in Berlin, Germany. Researchers from two major disciplines, bat biologists and disease specialists, met for the first time in an interdisciplinary event to share their knowledge about bat-associated diseases. The focus of the meeting was to understand why in particular bats are the hosts of so many of the most virulent diseases globally. During several sessions, key note speakers and participants discussed infectious diseases associated with bats, including viral diseases caused by Henipa-, Filo-, Corona- and Lyssaviruses, the spread of white-nose syndrome in North American bats, bat immunology/immunogenetics, bat parasites, and finally, conservation and human health issues.",

Some recent investigations in China have found that up to 90% of the animals collected in caves are new to science, yet environmental assessments for development projects in karst areas rarely if ever give attention to the cave fauna.\n                \n                \n                  The lack of light, and the cave‐specific conditions of humidity, air flow and source of energy have resulted in extreme adaptations among the animals living within them.\n                \n                \n                  There is no government agency or non‐governmental organization (NGO) on conservation concerned with caves in China or many other countries, and although there are caving expeditions, they concentrate on exploration rather than the cave fauna.\n                \n                \n                  Disturbance by limestone quarrying, visitors, tourism infrastructure, and changes in water flow through, or from above, the cave can have devastating effects on the highly adapted and range‐restricted fauna.\n                \n                \n                  Some examples of World Bank‐financed development projects which have led to cave conservation are given.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications.\n                    The cave biodiversity of China and neighbouring countries is worthy of conservation and there is a huge number of nationally endemic species, most of which are unknown. Destruction or damage to caves can cause entire communities of cave species to become extinct. To address this problem, the disparate, taxon‐limited specialists interested in cave fauna need to reach out to the cave exploration community, the major conservation NGOs, and the state and local conservation agencies. Those charged with the task of conserving biodiversity should give thought to how the current national protected area systems and processes manage – and fail – to address the needs of the cave fauna, and look for the means to effect the necessary changes in management, based on the peculiar ecology of caves.",

We explore specialization and interaction patterns of ﬂeas infesting non-volant small mammals in Bornean rainforests, using material from a ﬁeld survey carried out in two montane localities in northwestern Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia) and from a literature database of all available interactions in both lowland and montane forests. A total of 234 ﬂea individuals collected during our ﬁeld survey resulted in an interaction network of eight ﬂea species on seven live-captured small mammal species. The interaction network from all compiled studies currently includes 15 ﬂea species and 16 small mammal species. Host speciﬁcity and niche partitioning of ﬂeas infesting diurnal treeshrews and squirrels were low, with little difference in specialization among taxa, but host speciﬁcity in lowland forests was found to be higher than in montane forests. By contrast, Sigmactenus alticola (Siphonaptera: Leptopsyllidae) exhibited low host speciﬁcity by infesting various montane and lowland nocturnal rats. However, this species exhibited low niche partitioning as it was the only commonly recorded ﬂea from rats on Borneo. Overall complementary specialization was of intermediate intensity for both networks and differed signiﬁcantly from random association; this has important implications for speciﬁc interactions that are also relevant to the potential spread of vector-borne diseases.",

Extensive research into habitat needs (primarily for roosting) of reproductive females during the previous 2 decades has produced a wealth of information useful for developing conservation strategies for this group in their summer roost areas. However, the ecological needs of males, non-reproductive females, and juveniles have received far less attention, as have the ecological needs of all bats outside the pup-rearing season. Hence, it is unlikely that a single paradigm could comprehensively address conservation needs of all demographic groups within a species because they may have different seasonal distributions, reproductive strategies, and thermoregulatory needs. Herein, we recommend research into a wider spectrum of demographic groups and seasons to form a more holistic vision of the conservation needs of bats. We urge greater attention to understanding thermo-energetic and reproductive underpinnings of observed patterns of seasonal distribution and habitat selection by bats in the USA. Such understanding is instrumental for development of scientifically sound conservation strategies to confront emerging threats to conservation of bats in the 21st century: climate change, disease, habitat degradation, and environmental contaminants. We discuss interconnections among these emerging threats and the fundamental need to incorporate understanding of thermo-energetic strategies of bats in development of conservation strategies or legislation to mitigate potential impacts on bat populations of the USA.",

            "abstractNote": "Cymothoid isopods are a diverse group of ectoparasites of ﬁsh species, and are particularly conspicuous as they are large and attach to the body surface, mouth, and gill chamber of ﬁsh hosts. These parasites transition from juvenile to male to female, and how their size changes with ontogeny and correlates with host size is not well understood. To better understand these relationships, data from ﬁeld and museum collected samples of South Africa were combined to test for the associations between host and parasite length for three mouth and one gill chamber-infesting genera (Ceratothoa, Cinusa, Cymothoa, and Mothocya respectively). Generally, the number of parasites collected from 90 h of museum surveying was similar to that of seven, one-week long ﬁeld collections. For two of the three mouth-infesting parasites, parasite and host size were signiﬁcantly and positively correlated for males and females, but not juveniles. For gill chamber-infesting parasites, female and male parasite sizes were weakly and not signiﬁcantly correlated with host size. These results provide the ﬁrst morphometric data and growth relationship data for African cymothoid species and their ﬁsh hosts, and demonstrate the value and eﬃciency of using museum collections in ecological research.",

            "abstractNote": "Predicting and simplifying which pathogens may spill over from animals to humans is a major priority in infectious disease biology. Many efforts to determine which viruses are at risk of spillover use a subset of viral traits to ﬁnd trait-based associations with spillover. We adapt a new method—phylofactorization—to identify not traits but lineages of viruses at risk of spilling over. Phylofactorization is used to partition the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses viral taxonomy based on non-human host range of viruses and whether there exists evidence the viruses have infected humans. We identify clades on a range of taxonomic levels with high or low propensities to spillover, thereby simplifying the classiﬁcation of zoonotic potential of mammalian viruses. Phylofactorization by whether a virus is zoonotic yields many disjoint clades of viruses containing few to no representatives that have spilled over to humans. Phylofactorization by non-human host breadth yields several clades with signiﬁcantly higher host breadth. We connect the phylogenetic factors above with life-histories of clades, revisit trait-based analyses, and illustrate how cladistic coarse-graining of zoonotic potential can reﬁne trait-based analyses by illuminating clade-speciﬁc determinants of spillover risk.",

            "abstractNote": "The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.",

They are caused by all types of pathogenic agents, including bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses and prions. Although they have been recognised for many centuries, their impact on public health has increased in the last few decades due to a combination of the success in reducing the spread of human infectious diseases through vaccination and effective therapies and the emergence of novel zoonotic diseases. It is being increasingly recognised that a One Health approach at the human–animal–ecosystem interface is needed for effective investigation, prevention and control of any emerging zoonotic disease. Here, the authors will review the drivers for emergence, highlight some of the high-impact emerging zoonotic diseases of the last two decades and provide examples of novel One Health approaches for disease investigation, prevention and control. Although this review focuses on emerging zoonotic viral diseases, the authors consider that the discussions presented in this paper will be equally applicable to emerging zoonotic diseases of other pathogen types.",

            "abstractNote": "The purpose of this review is to clarify the concepts of bias, precision and accuracy as they are commonly defined in the biostatistical literature, with our focus on the use of these concepts in quantitatively testing the performance of point estimators (specifically species richness estimators). We first describe the general concepts underlying bias, precision and accuracy, and then describe a number of commonly used unscaled and scaled performance measures of bias, precision and accuracy (e.g. mean error, variance, standard deviation, mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute error, and all their scaled counterparts) which may be used to evaluate estimator performance. We also provide mathematical formulas and a worked example for most performance measures. Since every measure of estimator performance should be viewed as suggestive, not prescriptive, we also mention several other performance measures that have been used by biostatisticians or ecologists. We then outline several guidelines of how to test the performance of species richness estimators: the detailed description of data simulation models and resampling schemes, the use of real and simulated data sets on as many different estimators as possible, mathematical expressions for all estimators and performance measures, and the presentation of results for each scaled performance measure in numerical tables with increasing levels of sampling effort. We finish with a literature review of promising new research related to species richness estimation, and summarize the results of 14 studies that compared estimator performance, which confirm that with most data sets, non‐parametric estimators (mostly the Chao and jackknife estimators) perform better than other estimators, e.g. curve models or fitting species‐abundance distributions.",

            "abstractNote": "Introduction: In the continental US, four terrestrial mammalian species are reservoirs for seven antigenic rabies virus variants. Cross species transmission (CST) occurs when a rabies virus variant causes disease in non-reservoir species.\nMethods: This study analyzed national surveillance data for rabies in terrestrial mammals. The CST rate was defined as: number of rabid non-reservoir animals/number of rabid reservoir animals. CST rates were analyzed for trend. Clusters of high CST rate counties were evaluated using space-time scanning statistics.\nResults: The number of counties reporting a raccoon variant CST rate .1.0 increased from 75 in 1992 to 187 in 2011; counties with skunk variant CST rates .1.0 remained unchanged during the same period. As of 2011, for every rabid raccoon reported within the raccoon variant region, there were 0.73 cases of this variant reported in non-reservoir animals. Skunks were the most common non-reservoir animal reported with the raccoon rabies variant. Domestic animals were the most common non-reservoir animal diagnosed with a skunk rabies virus variant (n = 1,601). Cross species transmission rates increased fastest among domestic animals.\nConclusions: Cross species transmission of rabies virus variants into non-reservoir animals increases the risk of human exposures and threatens current advances toward rabies control. Cross species transmission in raccoon rabies enzootic regions increased dramatically during the study period. Pet owners should vaccinate their dogs and cats to ensure against CST, particularly in regions with active foci of rabies circulation. Clusters of high CST activity represent areas for further study to better understand interspecies disease transmission dynamics. Each CST event has the potential to result in a rabies virus adapted for sustained transmission in a new species; therefore further understanding of the dynamics of CST may help in early detection or prevention of the emergence of new terrestrial rabies virus variants.",

The historical presence of Bd in the indigenous African population of Xenopus is well documented. However, there are no reports documenting the presence of Bd in wild Xenopus populations in the US, particularly in California where introduced populations are well-established after intentional or accidental release. In this report, a survey was conducted on 178 archived specimens of 6 species of Xenopus collected in Africa from 1871–2000 and on 23 archived specimens (all wild-caught Xenopus laevis) collected in California, USA between 2001 and 2010. The overall prevalence rate of Bd in the tested Xenopus was 2.8%. The earliest positive specimen was X. borealis collected in Kenya in 1934. The overall prevalence of Bd in the X. laevis collected in California was 13% with 2 positive specimens from 2001 and one positive specimen from 2003. The positive Xenopus (3/23) collected in California were collected in 2001 (2/3) and 2003 (1/3). These data document the presence of Bd-infected wild Xenopus laevis in California. The findings reported here support the prevailing hypothesis that Bd was present as a stable, endemic infection in Xenopus populations in Africa prior to their worldwide distribution likely via international live-amphibian trade.",

            "abstractNote": "A novel DNA fingerprinting technique called AFLP is described. The AFLP technique is based on the selective PCR amplification of restriction fragments from a total digest of genomic DNA. The technique involves three steps: (i) restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification of sets of restriction fragments, and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification of restriction fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets of restriction fragments may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers of restriction fragments. The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system. Typically 50-100 restriction fragments are amplified and detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The AFLP technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA fingerprinting technique for DNAs of any origin or complexity.",

Here, we tested in long-distance migratory Nathusius’ pipistrelles (\n              Pipistrellus nathusii\n              ), if selected branches of immunity are expressed differently in response to the energy demands and oxidative stress of aerial migration. During the migration period, we observed higher baseline lymphocyte and lower neutrophil levels than during the pre-migration period, but no stronger response of cellular effectors to an antigen challenge. Baseline plasma haptoglobin, as a component of the humoral innate immunity, remained similar during both seasons, yet baseline plasma haptoglobin levels increased by a factor of 7.8 in migratory bats during an immune challenge, whereas they did not change during the pre-migration period. Oxidative stress was higher during migration than during pre-migration, yet there was no association between blood oxidative status and immune parameters, and immune challenge did not trigger any changes in oxidative stress, irrespective of season. Our findings suggest that humoral effectors of the acute phase response may play a stronger role in the first-line defense against infections for migrating bats compared to non-migrating bats. We conclude that Nathusius’ pipistrelles allocate resources differently into the branches of their immune system, most likely following current demands resulting from tight energy budgets during migration.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: A central question for ecologists is the extent to which anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. tourism) might impact wildlife and affect the systems under study. From a research perspective, identifying the effects of human disturbance caused by research-related activities is crucial in order to understand and account for potential biases and derive appropriate conclusions from the data.\nResults: Here, we document a case of biological adjustment to chronic human disturbance in a colonial seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), breeding on remote and protected islands of the Southern ocean. Using heart rate (HR) as a measure of the stress response, we show that, in a colony with areas exposed to the continuous presence of humans (including scientists) for over 50 years, penguins have adjusted to human disturbance and habituated to certain, but not all, types of stressors. When compared to birds breeding in relatively undisturbed areas, birds in areas of high chronic human disturbance were found to exhibit attenuated HR responses to acute anthropogenic stressors of low-intensity (i.e. sounds or human approaches) to which they had been subjected intensely over the years. However, such attenuation was not apparent for high-intensity stressors (i.e. captures for scientific research) which only a few individuals experience each year.\nConclusions: Habituation to anthropogenic sounds/approaches could be an adaptation to deal with chronic innocuous stressors, and beneficial from a research perspective. Alternately, whether penguins have actually habituated to anthropogenic disturbances over time or whether human presence has driven the directional selection of human-tolerant phenotypes, remains an open question with profound ecological and conservation implications, and emphasizes the need for more knowledge on the effects of human disturbance on long-term studied populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Current claims of biodiversity crisis call for immediate conservation actions. These require the identiﬁcation of priority sites for conservation based on an assessment of biodiversity patterns. Patterns of species richness are crucial in such endeavor. Also rarity, measured by the size of species’ geographical ranges, is often used as a single or complementary criterion. For instance, hotspots for conservation have been deﬁned using either one or the other criterion. We apply a novel tool, range–diversity plots, which simultaneously analyze species richness and range size from a presence–absence matrix to identify sites and species with potential conservation value. We applied this tool to the Mexican avifauna and show how it can be readily used to conduct broad-scale conservation assessments. Mexican birds showed congruent patterns between richness and rarity, richer sites harbor small-ranged species. Also, we identiﬁed Mexican ecoregions harboring richness–rarity sites and compared our assessment with an exhaustive prioritization procedure. A range–diversity approach can be useful when ﬁne-scale information is lacking, such as in poorly studied regions. We demonstrate that spatial congruence between richness and rarity can be easily identiﬁed and interpreted using range–diversity plots based solely on a presence–absence matrix, providing a transparent, robust and explicit application for conservation assessments.",
