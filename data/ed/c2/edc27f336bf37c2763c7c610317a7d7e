            "abstractNote": "Skin is a key aspect of the immune system in the defence against pathogens. Skin pH regulates the activity of enzymes produced both by hosts and by microbes on host skin, thus implicating pH in disease susceptibility. Skin pH varies interand intra-specifically and is influenced by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic variables. Increased skin alkalinity is associated with a predisposition to cutaneous infections in humans and dogs, and inter-specific and inter-individual variation in skin pH is implicated in differential susceptibility to some skin diseases. The cutaneous pH of bats has not been characterized but is postulated to play a role in susceptibility to white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal infection that has decimated several Nearctic bat species. We used non-invasive probes to measure the pH of bat flight membranes in five species with differing susceptibility to WNS. Skin pH ranged from 4.67 to 8.59 and varied among bat species, geographic locations, body parts, age classes, sexes and seasons. Wild Eptesicus fuscus were consistently more acidic than wild Myotis lucifugus, Myotis leibii and Perimyotis subflavus. Juvenile bats had more acidic skin than adults during maternity season but did not differ during swarming. Male M. lucifugus were more acidic than females during maternity season, yet this trend reversed during swarming. Bat skin was more acidic in summer compared to winter, a pattern also reported in humans. Skin pH was more acidic in captive than wild E. fuscus, suggesting environmental impacts on skin pH. The pH of roosting substrates affects skin pH in captive bats and may partially explain seasonal patterns in wild bats that use different roost types across seasons. Future research on the influence of pH on microbial pathogenic factors and skin barrier function may provide valuable insights on new therapeutic targets for treating bat skin conditions.",

We developed an approach based on DNA from feces gathered passively to generate microsatellite data for individual lesser long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae), which are important pollinators for columnar cacti and agave across much of Mexico and in the southwestern U.S. We collected feces from roosts near the U.S-Mexico border and developed a two-step amplification approach to characterize five highly polymorphic microsatellite loci from fecal DNA. Addition of a multiplex PCR step improved amplification success and conserved DNA extracts with a minimal increase in cost. In our initial screening of 433 samples, five focal loci distinguished individuals reliably, with a probability of identity (i.e., the probability of two unrelated individuals having the same microsatellite profile by chance) of 7.5E-09. Repeated analyses revealed a genotyping error rate < 2%. We explore the benefits and limits of our approach for population studies of lesser long-nosed bats and other nectivorous and frugivorous species that provide key ecosystem services and are often of conservation concern.",

Understanding the genetic connectivity and population structure of such elusive mammals is important for assessing their conservation status. In this study, we report the genetic diversity and structure of M. bechsteinii across Britain and Europe. Assessments were made using 14 microsatellite markers and a 747 bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Nuclear DNA (microsatellites) showed high levels of genetic diversity and little inbreeding across the species range, though genetic diversity was slightly lower in Britain than in mainland Europe. Bayesian and spatial PCA analysis showed a clear separation between the British and European sites. Within Europe, the Italian population south of the Alps was isolated from the other sites. In Britain, there was genetic structuring between the northern and southern part of the geographical range. Despite there being little genetic divergence in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences throughout most of Europe, the mtDNA patterns in Britain confirmed this separation of northern and southern populations. Such genetic structuring within Britain—in the absence of any obvious physical barriers—suggests that other factors such as land-use may limit gene-flow.",

            "abstractNote": "The fungal infection causing white-nose disease in hibernating bats in North America has resulted in dramatic population declines of affected species, since the introduction of the causative agent Pseudogymnoascus destructans. The fungus is native to the Palearctic, where it also infects several bat species, yet rarely causes severe pathology or the death of the host. Pseudogymnoascus destructans infects bats during hibernation by invading and digesting the skin tissue, resulting in the disruption of torpor patterns and consequent emaciation. Relations among pathogen, host, and environment are complex, and individuals, populations, and species respond to the fungal pathogen in different ways. For example, the Nearctic Myotis lucifugus responds to infection by mounting a robust immune response, leading to immunopathology often contributing to mortality. In contrast, the Palearctic M. myotis shows no signiﬁcant immunological response to infection. This lack of a strong response, resulting from the long coevolution between the hosts and the pathogen in the pathogen’s native range, likely contributes to survival in tolerant species. After more than 15 years since the initial introduction of the fungus to North America, some of the affected populations are showing signs of recovery, suggesting that the fungus, hosts, or both are undergoing processes that may eventually lead to coexistence. The suggested or implemented management methods of the disease in North America have encompassed, for example, the use of probiotics and fungicides, vaccinations, and modifying the environmental conditions of the hibernation sites to limit the growth of the pathogen, intensity of infection, or the hosts’ responses to it. Based on current knowledge from Eurasia, policy makers and conservation managers should refrain from disrupting the ongoing evolutionary processes and adopt a holistic approach to managing the epizootic.",

These markers will be useful in determining impacts of forest fragmentation on this species.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal disease that has caused precipitous declines in several North American bat species, creating an urgent need for conservation. We examined how microclimates and other characteristics of hibernacula have affected bat populations following WNS-associated declines and evaluated whether cooling of warm, little-used hibernacula could beneﬁt bats. During the period following mass mortality (2013–2020), we conducted 191 winter surveys of 25 unmanipulated hibernacula and 6 manipulated hibernacula across Pennsylvania (USA). We joined these data with additional datasets on historical (pre-WNS) bat counts and on the spatial distribution of underground sites. We used generalized linear mixed models and model selection to identify factors affecting bat populations. Winter counts of Myotis lucifugus were higher and increased over time in colder hibernacula (those with midwinter temperatures of 3–6 ◦C) compared with warmer (7–11 ◦C) hibernacula. Counts of Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis leibii, and Myotis septentrionalis were likewise higher in colder hibernacula (temperature effects = –0.73 [SE 0.15], –0.51 [0.18], and –0.97 [0.28], respectively). Populations of M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis increased most over time in hibernacula surrounded by more nearby sites, whereas Eptesicus fuscus counts remained high where they had been high before WNS onset (pre-WNS high count effect = 0.59 [0.22]). Winter counts of M. leibii were higher in hibernacula with high vapor pressure deﬁcits (VPDs) (particularly over 0.1 kPa) compared with sites with lower VPDs (VPD effect = 15.3 [4.6]). Counts of M. lucifugus and E. fuscus also appeared higher where VPD was higher. In contrast, Perimyotis subﬂavus counts increased over time in relatively warm hibernacula and were unaffected by VPD. Where we manipulated hibernacula, we achieved cooling of on average 2.1 ◦C. At manipulated hibernacula, counts of M. lucifugus and P. subﬂavus increased over time (years since manipulation effect = 0.70 [0.28] and 0.51 [0.15], respectively). Further, there were more E. fuscus where cooling was greatest (temperature difference effect = –0.46 [SE 0.11]), and there was some evidence there were more P. subﬂavus in hibernacula sections that remained warm after manipulation. These data show bats are responding effectively to WNS through habitat selection. In M. lucifugus, M. septentrionalis, and possibly P. subﬂavus, this response is ongoing, with bats increasingly aggregating at suitable hibernacula, whereas E. fuscus remain in previously favored sites. Our results suggest that cooling warm sites receiving little use by bats is a viable strategy for combating WNS.",

Food-deprived bats were torpid longer than bats offered food ad libitum. Bats placed in a gradient of low (0 °C–25 °C) ambient temperatures (Ta) spent more time in torpor than bats in a gradient of high (7 °C–43 °C) Ta's. However, we did not observe seasonal variations in the use of torpor. Moreover, even when food deprived in winter, bats never entered prolonged torpor at Ta's characteristic of their natural hibernation. Instead, bats preferred shallow torpor at relatively high Ta, but they always maintained a difference between body and ambient temperatures of less than 2 °C. Calculations based on respirometric measurements of metabolic rate showed that food deprived bats spent less energy per unit of time in torpor than fed individuals, even when they entered torpor at higher Ta's. We conclude that Ta likely serves as a signal of food availability and daily torpor is apparently an adaptation to unpredictable changes in food availability, such as its decrease in summer or its increase in winter. Thus, we interpret hibernation to be a second step in the evolution of heterothermy in bats, which allows survival in seasonal environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Extinctions typically have ecological drivers, such as habitat loss. However, extinction events are also influenced by policy and management settings that may be antithetical to biodiversity conservation, inadequate to prevent extinction, insufficiently resourced, or poorly implemented. Three endemic Australian vertebrate species—the Christmas Island pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi), Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola), and Christmas Island forest skink (Emoia nativitatis)—became extinct from 2009 to 2014. All 3 extinctions were predictable and probably preventable. We sought to identify the policy, management, research, and other shortcomings that contributed to their extinctions or failed to prevent them. These included a lack within national environmental legislation and policy of explicit commitment to the prevention of avoidable extinctions, lack of explicit accountability, inadequate resources for conservation (particularly for species not considered charismatic or not of high taxonomic distinctiveness), inadequate biosecurity, a slow and inadequate process for listing species as threatened, recovery planning that failed to consider the need for emergency response, inability of researchers to identify major threatening factors, lack of public engagement and involvement in conservation decisions, and limited advocacy. From these 3 cases, we recommend: environmental policy explicitly seeks to prevent extinction of any species and provides a clear chain of accountability and an explicit requirement for public inquiry following any extinction; implementation of a timely and comprehensive process for listing species as threatened and for recovery planning; reservation alone not be assumed sufficient to maintain species; enhancement of biosecurity measures; allocation of sufficient resources to undertake actions necessary to prevent extinction; monitoring be considered a pivotal component of the conservation response; research provides timely identification of factors responsible for decline and of the risk of extinction; effective dissemination of research results; advocacy by an informed public for the recovery of threatened species; and public involvement in governance of the recovery process. These recommendations should be applicable broadly to reduce the likelihood and incidence of extinctions.",

We used long-term distribution records for 17 bat species together with grey relational analysis, the fuzzy-set classification technique, a consistency index, and attribution methods. Over the past 50 years, bat species distributions have primarily shifted northward, and most of these changes are correlated with the thermal index. In response to climatic factors over the past 50 years, the ranges and distribution centers of particular bat species have shifted to the north or to the west. The observed and predicted changes in the distributions were highly consistent for certain species. Changes in the northern limit or the center of the distribution can be attributed to climate change for nearly half of the species studied.",

            "abstractNote": "Many tropical endotherms are already confronted by ambient temperatures (Ta) close to their body temperature (Tb) and risk severe hyperthermia due to global warming. Tropical fruit bats play a vital role in the ecosystem and their absence could have dire consequences for ecosystem health. Many fruit bats have exposed roosting habits that increase their vulnerability to heat stress. We investigated the thermoregulatory capacity of wild caught lesser dog-faced fruit bats Cynopterus brachyotis from the Island of Borneo; a heterothermic 32 g foliage-roosting generalist bat. We determined the effect of Ta (21−36°C) on metabolism, Tb and evaporative cooling. We also measured the Ta and relative humidity (RH) at capture sites. The bats displayed a seemingly narrow thermoneutral zone of 30 ± 1°C, a basal metabolic rate of 5.60 ± 0.26 W kg−1 (1.01 ± 0.05 ml O2 g−1 h−1) and a normothermic Tb of 32.5 ± 0.3°C; all much lower than expected. Evaporative cooling was only effective at Ta ≤ 31°C, above which heat storage became apparent. Bats typically entered torpor at Ta < 25°C and thermoconformed (i.e. allowed their Tb to fluctuate with Ta) at Ta > 32°C. The microclimate at capture sites remained cool (Ta = 24−25°C) and humid (RH > 90%). Our study supports the argument that tropical endotherms are susceptible to hyperthermia due to their low Tb. Further, we discuss the potential advantage of heterothermy in coping with short-term heatwaves. However, the future of these bats, and likely other low Tb species, depends primarily on their thermally buffered habitats, and decisive conservation action is required to protect thermal refugia.",

            "abstractNote": "The average genome size (GS) of bats, which are the only mammals capable of powered flight, is approximately 18% smaller than that of closely related mammalian orders. The low nuclear DNA content of Chiroptera is comparable to that of birds, which are also characterized by a high metabolic rate. Only a few chiropteran taxa possess notable amounts of constitutive heterochromatin. Here, we studied the karyotypes of two non-related vesper bat species with unusually high amounts of constitutive heterochromatin: Hesperoptenus doriae and Philetor brachypterus. Conventional staining methods and wholechromosome painting with probes derived from Myotis myotis (2n = 44), showing a karyotype close to that of the presumed ancestor of Vespertilionidae, revealed Robertsonian fusions as the main type of rearrangement leading to the exceptionally reduced diploid chromosome number of 2n = 26 in both species. Moreover, both karyotypes are characterized by large blocks of pericentromeric heterochromatin composed of CMA-positive and DA-DAPI-positive segments. In H. doriae, the heterochromatin accumulation has resulted in a genome size of 3.22 pg (1C), which is 40% greater than the mean genome size for the family. For P. brachypterus, a genome size of 2.94 pg was determined, representing an increase of about 28%. Most notably, in H. doriae, the presence of additional constitutive heterochromatin correlates with an extended mitotic cell cycle duration in vitro. A reduction in diploid chromosome number to 30 or lower is discussed as a possible cause of the accumulation of pericentromeric heterochromatin in Vespertilionidae.",

Alternatively, an input array may represent a single organism, for example a coiled snail or a segmented arthropod, with the rows representing, respectively, individual A whorls or segments. high degree of adaptability to different kinds of problems is achieved because of the numerous control cards which specify input and output format, table headings, and column numbers of variables on which operations are to be performed.",

Reports of leptospirosis in bats have increased and prompted epidemiological research in Brazil. This study aimed to perform a molecular and epidemiological investigation of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in bat kidneys. The total DNA was extracted from 102 kidney samples from chiropterous of different species and cities in Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), Brazil. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a fragment corresponding to lipL32 gene, which is only present in pathogenic Leptospira spp. lipL32 gene was detected in 22.5% (23/102) of the bat kidney tissues. Phylogenetic analysis showed that L. interrogans is circulating in bats in RS. Most species of the bats collected were insectivores. Pathogenic Leptospira spp. detection in bats demonstrated that these animals participate in the infection chain of leptospirosis and, therefore, may play as reservoirs and disseminators of this microorganism. Thus, it is important to monitor infectious agents, especially with zoonotic potential in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Most bats hunt insects on the wing at night using echolocation as their primary sensory modality, but nevertheless maintain complex eye anatomy and functional vision. This raises the question of how and when insectivorous bats use vision during their largely nocturnal lifestyle. Here, we test the hypothesis that the small insectivorous bat, Myotis daubentonii, relies less on echolocation, or dispenses with it entirely, as visual cues become available during challenging acoustic noise conditions. We trained five wild-caught bats to land on a spherical target in both silence and when exposed to broad-band noise to decrease echo detectability, while light conditions were manipulated in both spectrum and intensity. We show that during noise exposure, the bats were almost three times more likely to use multiple attempts to solve the task compared to in silent controls. Furthermore, the bats exhibited a Lombard response of 0.18 dB/dBnoise and decreased call intervals earlier in their flight during masking noise exposures compared to in silent controls. Importantly, however, these adjustments in movement and echolocation behaviour did not differ between light and dark control treatments showing that small insectivorous bats maintain the same echolocation behaviour when provided with visual cues under challenging conditions for echolocation. We therefore conclude that bat echolocation is a hard-wired sensory system with stereotyped compensation strategies to both target range and masking noise (i.e. Lombard response) irrespective of light conditions. In contrast, the adjustments of call intervals and movement strategies during noise exposure varied substantially between individuals indicating a degree of flexibility that likely requires higher order processing and perhaps vocal learning.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Vertical stratification is a key feature of tropical forests and structures plant–frugivore interactions. However, it is unclear whether vertical differences in plant‐frugivore interactions are due to differences among strata in plant community composition or inherent preferences of frugivores for specific strata. To test this, we observed fruit removal of a diverse frugivore community on the liana\n              Marcgravia longifolia\n              in a Peruvian rain forest. Unlike most other plants,\n              Marcgravia longifolia\n              produces fruits across forest strata. This enabled us to study effects of vertical stratification on fruit removal without confounding effects of plant species and stratum. We found a high number of visits of a few frugivore species in the understorey and a low number of visits of many different frugivores in the canopy and midstorey. Whereas partial and opportunistic frugivores foraged across strata with differing frequencies, obligate frugivores were only found eating fruits in the higher strata. Avian frugivores foraging in the canopy were mainly large species with pointed wings, whereas under‐ and midstorey avian foragers were smaller with rounded wings. Our findings suggest a continuous shift in the frugivore community composition along the vertical gradient, from a few generalized frugivores in the understorey to a diverse set of specialized frugivores in the canopy. This shift in the frugivore community leads to correlated, reciprocal changes from specialized to generalized plant‐frugivore interactions. Thus, we conclude that vertical niche differentiation between species in tropical forests persists even when food resources are available across strata. This highlights its role for promoting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.\n            \n            Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.\n          , \n            Abstract\n            \n              Estratificación vertical es una característica clave de bosques tropicales que estructura interacciones entre plantas y frugívoros. No obstante, no queda claro si diferencias verticales en interacciones plantas‐frugívoros se deben a diferencias entre estratos en la composición de comunidades de plantas o a preferencias inherentes de los frugívoros por estratos específicos. Para examinar eso, observamos la remoción de frutos de la liana\n              Marcgravia longifolia\n              por una comunidad diversa de frugívores en un bosque tropical del Perú. En contraste a la mayoría de las plantas,\n              Marcgravia longifolia\n              produce frutos en todos estratos del bosque. Eso nos permitía estudiar el efecto de estratificación vertical sobre la remoción de frutos sin el efecto confundiendo de especies de plantas y estrato. Encontramos un alto número de visitas de unas pocas especies de frugívoros en el sotobosque, y un número bajo de muchas diferentes especies de frugívoros en el dosel y el estrato medio. Mientras que frugívoros parciales y oportunistas forrajeaban en diferentes estratos con frecuencias variadas, frugívores obligatorios consumían frutos solo en estratos altos. Aves frugívoras forrajeando en el dosel mayormente estaban representados por especies grandes con alas puntiagudas, mientras que aves forrajeando en el sotobosque y estrato medio eran pequeñas con alas redondeadas. Nuestros resultados sugieren un desfase en la composición de la comunidad de frugívoros delante del gradiente vertical, desde unos frugívoros generalizados en el sotobosque hasta un set diverso de frugívoros especializados en el dosel. Este desfase lleva a cambios correlacionados y recíprocos de las interacciones planta‐frugívoros desde especializado hasta generalizado. Por eso, concluimos que la diferenciación vertical del nicho entre especies en bosques tropicales persiste aun cuando recursos están disponibles en todos estratos. Eso enfatiza el rol de estratificación vertical para promover biodiversidad y el funcionamiento de ecosistemas.",

Analyses of the current and future health and viability of these species may support conservation management decision making. Demographic modeling provides a quantitative tool for decision makers and conservation managers to make more informed decisions, but widespread adoption of these tools can be limited because of the complexity of the mathematical, statistical, and computational components involved in implementing these models. In this work, we provide an exposition of the BatTool R package, detailing the primary components of the matrix projection model, a publicly accessible graphical user interface (https://rconnect.usgs.gov/battool) facilitating user-defined scenario analyses, and its intended uses and limitations (Wiens et al., US Geol Surv Data Release 2022; Wiens et al., US Geol Surv Softw Release 2022). We present a case study involving wind energy permitting, weighing the effects of potential mortality caused by a hypothetical wind energy facility on the projected abundance of four imperiled bat species in the Midwestern United States.",

The chiropterofauna of the Serra da Mantiqueira remains relatively under-studied, and here we present a list of bat species from the “Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural (RPPN) Cachoeira do Tombo”, a private conservation unit located in an area of montane Atlantic Forest in the Serra da Mantiqueira. Bats were captured with mist nets along trails and near a diurnal roost. A total of 498 individuals of 19 bat species belonging to the families Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae and Molossidae were captured. Phyllostomidae were captured only along the trails, Molossidae were captured only in the diurnal roost and Vespertilionidae were captured in both. The species accumulation curves did not show stabilizing trends. However, 80% of the expected richness was sampled and the species richness of bats found is similar to other studies previously carried out in the region. In contrast to other inventories carried out in the Atlantic Forest, Desmodus rotundus was the species most frequently captured along the trails. A large number of individuals of Molossus aztecus sheltering in man-made structures were caught, constituting an unusual event. Additionally, here we report cohabitation of this species with Molossus molossus for the first time. Our results show that this area, which appears on the map of environmental conflicts for the state of Minas Gerais, has a rich chiropterofauna and also further corroborate the importance of using mist-nets at roosts to increase the probability of capturing the richness and abundance of insectivorous bats present in the area.",

            "abstractNote": "The Tropical Dry Forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems due to the loss of vegetation cover caused by anthropogenic activities. Understanding how plant-animal interactions occur in this type of ecosystem is particularly important because these interactions promote the maintenance and functioning of the ecosystems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify interactions between fruit bats and plants through mutualistic interaction networks in ten tropical dry forest fragments in Valle del Cauca, Colombia. For this purpose, we characterized the bat community, as well as the seeds found in their feces; with the data obtained, the structural properties of the network (nestedness, modularity and robustness) were evaluated. Our results show 36 species and 1142 individuals of bats, where we identified 19 669 seeds grouped in 85 interactions between 18 bat species and 19 plant species. Moreover, the resulting interaction network presented a nestedness, modular structure, robust to the loss of specialist species but susceptible to the loss of generalist species. These results demonstrate the importance of bats for the analysis of plantanimal interactions and highlight them as a key group to be considered in conservation and restoration plans in highly disturbed ecosystems such as the Tropical Dry Forest of Valle del Cauca.",

Negative impacts on volant animals, such as bats, include fatalities at turbines and habitat loss due to land-use change and displacement. Siting turbines away from ecologically sensitive areas and implementing measures to reduce fatalities are critical to protecting bat populations. Restricting turbine operations during periods of high bat activity is the most effective form of mitigation currently available to reduce fatalities. Compensating for habitat loss and offsetting mortality are not often practiced, because meaningful offsets are lacking. Legal frameworks to prevent or mitigate the negative impacts of wind energy on bats are absent in most countries, especially in emerging markets. Therefore, governments and lending institutions are key in reconciling wind energy production with biodiversity goals by requiring sufficient environmental standards for wind energy projects.",

            "abstractNote": "The ‘social microbiome’ can fundamentally shape the costs and benefits of group-living, but understanding social transmission of microbes in free-living animals is challenging due to confounding effects of kinship and shared environments (e.g. highly associated individuals often share the same spaces, food and water). Here, we report evidence for convergence towards a social microbiome among introduced common vampire bats,\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              , a highly social species in which adults feed only on blood, and engage in both mouth-to-body allogrooming and mouth-to-mouth regurgitated food sharing. Shotgun sequencing of samples from six zoos in the USA, 15 wild-caught bats from a colony in Belize and 31 bats from three colonies in Panama showed that faecal microbiomes were more similar within colonies than between colonies. To assess microbial transmission, we created an experimentally merged group of the Panama bats from the three distant sites by housing these bats together for four months. In this merged colony, we found evidence that dyadic gut microbiome similarity increased with both clustering and oral contact, leading to microbiome convergence among introduced bats. Our findings demonstrate that social interactions shape microbiome similarity even when controlling for past social history, kinship, environment and diet.",

One notable example is the Madeira pipistrelle (Pipistrellus maderensis), which inhabits the Macaronesian archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. Despite the high biogeographic and conservation importance of this species, there is limited information on its ecology and evolutionary history across different archipelagos. In our study, we employed species distribution models (SDMs) to identify suitable habitats for the Madeira pipistrelle and determine the environmental factors inﬂuencing its distribution. Additionally, we conducted molecular comparisons using mitochondrial DNA data from various Macaronesian islands. Molecular analyses provided compelling evidence for the presence of distinct Evolutionary Signiﬁcant Units on the different archipelagos. We identiﬁed distinct haplotypes in the populations of Madeira and the Canary Islands, with a genetic distance ranging from a minimum of 2.4% to a maximum of 3.3% between samples from different archipelagos. In support of this, SDMs highlighted relevant dissimilarities between the environmental requirements of the populations of the three archipelagos, particularly the climatic niche. Our research demonstrates that deeper investigations that combine ecological, morphological, and genetic areas are necessary to implement tailored conservation strategies.",

            "abstractNote": "Many studies have investigated the role of insectivorous bats as natural enemies of agricultural pests. However, insectivorous bats have a broad diet, and whether their prey species are beneficial or harmful is unknown; thus, accurately assessing the services provided by bats is challenging. In China, most people, including farmers and plant protection workers, have an insufficient understanding of the ecological value of bats in biological control. Therefore, we collected the fecal samples of 10 bat species from three different sampling sites located in Guizhou Province, China, and conducted DNA metabarcoding to determine the diet composition of bats. We also cate­ gorized the prey species from the diet of bats as harmful or beneficial, based on previous studies, and recorded the industries they affect. Our results showed that the 10 bat species consumed prey from 19 orders and 96 families; most of them being lepidopterans. Among 564 total prey species recorded, 390 (69.15%) were pests and 28 (4.96%) were beneficial insects. Among them, 326 (57.80%) were agriculture or forestry pests, such as globally present Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and Beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua). These results indicated that insectivorous bats have more beneficial effects than harmful effects, especially in the context of agriculture and forestry, as they suppressed very few beneficial arthropod mesopredators. By comparing the differences in the diet of I. io in different regions, we found that bats present in different regions can provide different predation services. Our study showed that insectivorous bats provide excellent pest suppression services in various industries and regions. It might be helpful for increasing awareness among people and bat conser­ vation in China and other regions.",

            "abstractNote": "Although positive effects on biodiversity of woody features in agricultural landscapes are widely recognized, questions remain as to which landscape context to prioritize their implementation and in what proportion. To investigate the response of farmland biodiversity to small woody features (SWF) density in different landscape compositions (cropland, grassland, mixed), we analyzed fine-resolution data from standardized monitoring schemes on 111 birds, 22 bats, and 25 bush cricket's species, at national scale (relying on 3772, 834 and 727 monitoring points) over the period 2015–2019, in metropolitan France. We used Generalized Additive Mixed Models to analyze population and community responses, through different metrics (abundance, species diversity, and functional composition). We found a positive response exhibited by the three taxa to SWF, more especially in cropland where the SWF density is the lowest relative to grassland and mixed landscapes. Also, our results suggested a non-linear response common to the three taxa, with an increased benefit up to at least 6 % of SWF density in cropland, and beyond for most of the metrics but to a lesser extent (e.g., maximum abundance reached at 7–12 % SWF). We note, however, that some species among farmland bird specialists are negatively impacted by SWF. Overall, we emphasize the benefits to promote woody features in agricultural landscapes, notably in cropland, to support biodiversity and its associated ecosystem functions. Our study provides crucial empirical evidence to the recommendations from previous studies and the relevance of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 to dedicate at least 10 % of farmland to high-diversity landscape features.",

            "abstractNote": "Wind power is a rapidly growing source of energy worldwide. It is crucial for climate change mitigation, but it also accelerates the degradation of biodiversity through habitat loss and the displacement of wildlife. To un­ derstand the extent of displacement and reasons for observations where no displacement is reported, we con­ ducted a systematic review of birds, bats, and terrestrial mammals. Eighty-four peer-reviewed studies of onshore wind power yielded 160 distinct displacement distances, termed cases. For birds, bats, and mammals, 63 %, 72 %, and 67 % of cases respectively reported displacement. Cranes (3/3 cases), owls (2/2), and semi-domestic reindeer (6/6) showed consistent displacement on average up to 5 km. Gallinaceus birds showed displace­ ment on average up to 5 km, but in 7/18 cases reported to show “no displacement”. Bats were displaced on average up to 1 km in 21/29 cases. Waterfowl (6/7 cases), raptors (24/30), passerines (16/32) and waders (8/ 19) were displaced on average up to 500 m. Observations of no displacement were suggested to result from methodological deficiencies, species-specific characteristics, and habitat conditions favorable for certain species after wind power development. Displacement-induced population decline could be mitigated by situating wind power in low-quality habitats, minimizing the small-scale habitat loss and collisions, and creating high-quality habitats to compensate for habitat loss. This review provides information on distance thresholds that can be employed in the design of future wind energy projects. However, most studies assessed the effects of turbine towers of <100 m high, while considerably larger turbines are being built today.",

            "abstractNote": "The ability of certain bat species to navigate in dense vegetation based on trains of short biosonar echoes could provide for an alternative parsimonious approach to obtaining the sensory information that is needed to achieve autonomy in complex natural environments. Although bat biosonar has much lower data rates and spatial (angular) resolution than commonly used human-made sensing systems such as LiDAR or stereo cameras, bat species that live in dense habitats have the ability to reliably detect narrow passageways in foliage. To study the sensory information that the animals may have available to accomplish this, we have used a biomimetic sonar system that was combined with a camera to record echoes and synchronized images from 10 different ﬁeld sites that featured narrow passageways in foliage. The synchronized camera and sonar data allowed us to create a large data set (130 000 samples) of labeled echoes using a teacher–student approach that used class labels derived from the images to provide training data for echo-based classiﬁers. The performance achieved in detecting passageways based on the ﬁeld data closely matched previous results obtained for gaps in an artiﬁcial foliage setup in the laboratory. With a deep feature extraction neural network (VGG16) a foliage-versus-passageway classiﬁcation accuracy of 96.64% was obtained. A transparent artiﬁcial intelligence approach (class-activation mapping) indicated that the classiﬁer network relied heavily on the initial rising ﬂank of the echoes. This ﬁnding could be exploited with a neuromorphic echo representation that consisted of times where the echo envelope crossed a certain amplitude threshold in a given frequency channel. Whereas a single amplitude threshold was sufﬁcient for this in the previous laboratory study, multiple thresholds were needed to achieve an accuracy of 92.23%. These ﬁndings indicate that despite many sources of variability that shape clutter echoes from natural environments, these signals contain sufﬁcient sensory information to enable the detection of passageways in foliage.",

However, there has been little prior work toward understanding bat ﬂight maneuvers, particularly using a coupled kinematic and aerodynamic framework. Here, wing kinematic data of a large insectivorous bat (Hipposideros armiger) in straight and turning ﬂight is investigated. Fundamental to turning ﬂight are asymmetries in the wing kinematics and consequently asymmetries in the aerodynamic forces. Forces were calculated from the wing kinematics using aerodynamic numerical simulations. Aspects of the wing kinematics in the turn that were distinguishable from straight ﬂight were an increase in stroke plane deviation angle, nominal increase in ﬂapping amplitude, and a decrease in the horizontal stroke plane angle of the wing inside the turn. While prior work on the mechanics of turning ﬂight in animals has focused on classifying a turn as either banking or yawing, in the present work we show evidence of simultaneous and synergistic banking and yawing mechanisms. During the initiation of the turn, the bank angle was low, and elevated thrust by the outside wing generated a signiﬁcant yaw rotational moment during both the upstroke and downstroke. Later in the turn, the bank angle increased to approximately 25 degrees tilting the net force vector toward the inside of the turn providing centripetal acceleration thereby turning the bat. Understanding the details of the turning mechanism—combined yaw and bank—provides useful design and control principles for biomimetic ﬂapping MAVs.",

A case study of the endangered Paciﬁc sheath-tailed bat (Emballonura semicaudata rotensis) illustrates the importance of investigating indirect effects of invasion on species of conservation concern. We hypothesized that two invaders, feral goats and Lantana camara, would indirectly affect the bat by decreasing availability of suitable resources. Speciﬁcally, that microclimate and bat prey abundances in lantana shrub differ from native forest habitat, and that preferential browsing by goats structures forests to be less suitable for bats. Our results suggest that bats avoid lantana shrub. However, we found no evidence that preferential goat browsing inﬂuenced bat activity. Our research implies that the impact of lantana on the persistence of the bat has been underestimated and that it is unclear how goats alter bat habitat aside from reducing understory vegetation. Future managers should prioritize efforts that restore native forest and reforest areas currently dominated by lantana. We urge conservation scientists to evaluate indirect effects of invasive species and publish ﬁndings that elucidate the consequences for native populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Regional conservation plans are increasingly used to plan for and protect biodiversity at large spatial scales however the means of quantitatively evaluating their effectiveness are rarely speciﬁed. Multiple-species approaches, particular those which employ site-occupancy estimation, have been proposed as robust and efﬁcient alternatives for assessing the status of wildlife populations over large spatial scales, but implemented examples are few. I used bats as a model to evaluate design considerations for the use of occupancy estimation to assess population status and habitat associations for eight species of bats covered under a regional conservation plan. Bats were one of the groups expected to beneﬁt from a system of reserves for species associated with late-successional/old-growth (LSOG) habitat designated under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP). This study produced the ﬁrst estimates for probabilities of occupancy and detection for bats at a regional scale. Overall probabilities of occupancy ranged from 0.586 to 0.783 and probabilities of detection ranged from 0.239 to 0.532 among the eight species modeled. Although point estimates of occupancy suggested association with NWFP habitat categories for some species, estimate precision was low. Models that assumed constant occupancy with respect to reserve- and LSOG-status were supported for most species. I used model-averaged estimates of occupancy and detection for each species to estimate survey effort necessary to meet precision targets. Occupancy estimation was best suited to species with the highest detection probabilities. Species that are rare or difﬁcult to detect will require enhancement in survey methods or more intensive survey effort to produce meaningful estimates. Optimizing monitoring efforts to address multiple species requires tradeoffs among survey methods, levels of effort, and acceptable levels of precision.",

            "abstractNote": "Unlike ﬂapping birds and insects, bats possess membrane wings that are more similar to many gliding mammals. The vast majority of the wing is composed of a thin compliant skin membrane stretched between the limbs, hand, and body. Membrane wings are of particular interest because they may offer many advantages to micro air vehicles. One critical feature of membrane wings is that they camber passively in response to aerodynamic load, potentially allowing for simpliﬁed wing control. However, for maximum membrane wing performance, tuning of the membrane structure to aerodynamic conditions is necessary. Bats possess an array of muscles, the plagiopatagiales proprii, embedded within the wing membrane that could serve to tune membrane stiffness, or may have alternative functions. We recorded the electromyogram from the plagiopatagiales proprii muscles of Artibeus jamaicensis, the Jamaican fruit bat, in ﬂight at two different speeds and found that these muscles were active during downstroke. For both lowand high-speed ﬂight, muscle activity increased between late upstroke and early downstroke and decreased at late downstroke. Thus, the array of plagiopatagiales may provide a mechanism for bats to increase wing stiffness and thereby reduce passive membrane deformation. These muscles also activate in synchrony, presumably as a means to maximize force generation, because each muscle is small and, by estimation, weak. Small differences in activation timing were observed when comparing low- and high-speed ﬂight, which may indicate that bats modulate membrane stiffness differently depending on ﬂight speed.",

Understanding the origin of this coronavirus is important for the prevention of future outbreaks. The dominant point of view that the virus transferred to humans either directly from bats or through an intermediate mammalian host has been challenged by Segreto and Deigin, who claim that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has certain features suggestive of its artificial creation. Following their response to our commentary, here we continue the discussion of the proposed arguments for this hypothesis. We show that neither the existence of a furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2, nor the presence of specific sequences within the nucleotide insertion encoding that site are evidence for intelligent design. We also explain why existing genetic data, viral diversity and past human history suggest that a natural origin of the virus is the most likely scenario. Genetic evidence suggesting otherwise is yet to be presented.",

            "abstractNote": "Healthy wing membranes are essential for bats. They are critical for maintaining the water balance and, during hibernation, they protect the bat’s body from dehydration. Assessing the state of the membrane visually is an easy and effective way to monitor a bat’s health and discover abnormal structures and infections in wild bat populations. During pre- and post-hibernation surveys of bats’ wings, we identified the presence of skin mites,\n              Psorergatoides kerivoulae\n              (Fain, 1959). The parasite causes cutaneous lesions on the wing membranes of the greater moused-eared bat,\n              Myotis myotis\n              (Borkhausen, 1797) and the lesser moused-eared bat,\n              Myotis blythii\n              (Tomes, 1857). The lesser mouse-eared bat is a new host for this parasite. Our study is the first to describe the histopathology of the infection on the wings of the greater and lesser mouse-eared bats. To our knowledge, this is the southernmost record of this parasite and the first mention of the genus\n              Psorergatoides\n              for the Balkans.",

            "abstractNote": "Climate and land-cover changes are among major threats to biodiversity. However, the interactive effects of the two threats are often overlooked in conservation planning. Using 81 bat species occurring in Vietnam as a case, we investigated the individual and interactive effects of climate and land-cover changes, highlighting the importance of this information for conservation efforts. By using species distribution models, we predicted the potential changes in range size among species and in species richness across Vietnam by the 2050s, considering projected climate and land-cover changes under two emission scenarios. Our results revealed that both threats individually would have predominantly negative effects on bats in Vietnam. Moreover, when these threats occur simultaneously, their interactions would generally intensify the impacts by mitigating individual positive effects and/or enhancing negative effects. However, we also found large interspecific and geographic variations in the direction and magnitude of these effects. Forest specialists, insectivores and cave-roosting species were predicted to be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects, with northern and southern Vietnam being more affected. These results underscore the urgent need to incorporate both climate and land-cover changes, as well as their interactions, into conservation planning for bats in Vietnam and biodiversity in general. The species-specific and spatially-explicit information regarding the impacts of the two threats can guide conservation actions, allowing us to target more manageable and less uncertain threats, as well as prioritize the protection of more vulnerable species.",

Foragers acting optimally are expected to exploit feeding patches depending on the cost/benefit ratio, and some noises can cause increased foraging costs. We hypothesized that traffic noise affects foraging patch quality for aerial-insectivorous bats and predicted that there are measurable differences in their foraging activity and in their echolocation signals be­ tween nights with or without traffic noise. We tested these predictions in the Lesser Bulldog Bat, Noctilio albi­ ventris, foraging over aquaculture fishponds, by recording bat activity on nights playing traffic noise and on traffic-sound free control nights. We measured foraging activity by counting the number of search passes and feeding buzzes made by the bats and measured several characteristics of echolocation signals. Foraging activity was higher during noisy nights than during control ones, probably due to the need of more time to obtain in­ formation about prey under noisy conditions. When exposed to traffic noise, the bats changed the spectral and temporal characteristics of echolocation signals. We suggest that exposure to traffic noise increases foraging costs for N. albiventris and posit that these bats continue foraging under noisy conditions because they can modulate their echolocation signals to obtain enough information.",

In highly mobile animals, the latter is often accomplished through contact calls that are emitted at different rates by group members. Here, we describe and quantify intraand intergroup variation in contact calling rates in Spix’s disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor), a species that employs distinct inquiry and response calls to coordinate group movements during flight and while announcing roost locations. We evaluate the extent to which groups are composed of individuals with similar calling rates and estimate variation among and within groups. Our results show large variation in response calling rates among and within groups, both in terms of calling rates and the probability of being vocal or not; for example, a large portion (35%) of bats sampled did not produce these signals. For inquiry calls, we found that variation in calling rates was greater within than among groups, and in contrast to response calls, only a few individuals (3%) did not produce inquiry calls. Overall, we found support for the existence of intra- and intergroup differences in the context of contact calling in disc-winged bats, and our results suggest that different mechanisms may promote the evolution and maintenance of varying calling rates for the two types of calls studied.",

            "abstractNote": "Among mammals, bats exhibit extreme variation in sociality, with some species living largely solitary lives while others form colonies of more than a million individuals. Some tropical species form groups during the day that persist throughout the year while many temperate species only gather into groups during hibernation or parturition. How groups form and then persist has now been described for a number of species, but the degree to which kinship explains patterns of association has never been quantified across species. Here, we use social network analysis and genetic data to determine the extent to which relatedness contributes to associations among individuals estimated from free-ranging animals across nine species from four families of bats. Network analysis reveals that all species show evidence of emergent social structure. Variation in the strength of the relationship between genetic relatedness and social association appears to be related to the degree of roost switching, i.e., species in which individuals change roosts frequently tend to exhibit higher levels of association among relatives. Sex-biased dispersal determines whether associations were between male or female relatives. The strength of associations among kin does not predict known occurrence of complex behaviors, such as dominance or various types of cooperation, indicating that kinship is not a prerequisite for social complexity in bats.",

The bat fauna of this Balkan country is one of the least studied in Europe. In order to reduce this knowledge gap, bat research was carried out during a ten-day inventory in the vicinity of Čajniče in south-eastern BiH (Republic of Srpska). Mist net surveys resulted in the capture of 15 bat species: Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, R. hipposideros, Myotis brandtii, M. mystacinus sensu lato, M. alcathoe, M. emarginatus, M. nattereri, M. bechsteinii, M. blythii, Nyctalus leisleri, Eptesicus serotinus, Vespertilio murinus, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, and Plecotus auritus. Acoustic surveys resulted in recording one additional species: Barbastella barbastellus. Roost surveys yielded in the finding of three maternity colonies of R. hipposideros. The genetic analysis resulted in the first molecularly confirmed M. brandtii and M. alcathoe records for BiH. Capture of several post-lactating females, sexually active males and multiple juveniles is proof for reproducing populations of these species in the country. During this brief study, we found more than half of all known bat species in BiH in an area of circa 75 km2.",

            "abstractNote": "Traditionally, morphological characters were used for judging phylogenetic relationships. These features, however, are prone to convergent evolution, and therefore, some aspects of intrafamilial and most interfamilial relationships remained unsolved to a large extent. In recent times, genetic features were used to elucidate phylogenetic relationships in Chiroptera. In the following chapter, a short introduction to classical and molecular cytogenetic methods is given. Furthermore, types of chromosomal rearrangements detected by application of such techniques are described. Amongst the large number of characters obtained by comparative karyological analysis, two cytogenetic features, i.e. inv 2 and inv 5, could serve as synapomorphies for the suborder Pteropodiformes. This ﬁnding supports recent molecular genetic results which proposed a basal division of Chiroptera into Pteropodiformes and Vespertilioniformes, rejecting the traditional division into Mega- and Microchiroptera. Concerning the phylogenetic relationships within the superfamily Emballonuroidea, however, cytogenetic results are not consistent with traditional views. On the one hand, a common character connecting the genera Taphozous and Emballonura was not found. On the other hand, similarity in three chromosomal features suggests a closer relationship between Emballonura and Nycteris than hitherto suspected.",
