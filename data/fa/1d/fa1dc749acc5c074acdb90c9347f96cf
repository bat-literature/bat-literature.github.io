            "abstractNote": "It has long been postulated that the elongated hindwing tails of many saturniid moths have evolved to create false sonar targets to divert the attack of echolocation-guided bat predators. However, rigorous echo-acoustic evidence to support this hypothesis has been lacking. In this study, fluttering luna moths (Actias luna), a species with elongated hindwing tails, were ensonified with frequency modulated chirp signals from all angles of orientation and across the wingbeat cycle. High-speed stereo videography was combined with pulse compression sonar processing to characterize the echo information available to foraging bats. Contrary to previous suggestions, the results show that the tail echoes are weak and do not dominate the sonar returns, compared to the large, planar wings and the moth body. However, the distinctive twisted morphology of the tails create persistent echoes across all angles of orientation, which may induce erroneous sonar target localization and disrupt accurate tracking by echolocating bats. These findings thus suggest a refinement of the false target hypothesis to emphasize sonar localization errors induced by the twisted tails, and highlight the importance of physics-based approaches to study the sensory information involved in the evolutionary arms race between moths and their bat predators.",

            "abstractNote": "In many mammals, upward-sweeping frequency-modulated (FM) sounds (up-chirps) evoke larger auditory brainstem responses than downward-sweeping sounds (down-chirps). To determine if similar effects occur in FM echolocating bats, auditory evoked responses (AERs) in big brown bats in response to up-chirps and down-chirps at different chirp durations and levels were recorded. Even though down-chirps are the biologically relevant stimulus for big brown bats, up-chirps typically evoked larger peaks in the AER, but with some exceptions at the shortest chirp durations. The up-chirp duration that produced the largest AERs and the greatest differences between up-chirps and down-chirps varied between individual bats and stimulus levels. Cross-covariance analyses using the entire AER waveform confirmed that amplitudes were typically larger to up-chirps than down-chirps at supra-threshold levels, with optimal durations around 0.5–1 ms. Changes in response latencies with stimulus levels were consistent with previous estimates of amplitude-latency trading. Latencies tended to decrease with increasing up-chirp duration and increase with increasing down-chirp duration. The effects of chirp direction on AER waveforms are generally consistent with those seen in other mammals but with small differences in response patterns that may reflect specializations for FM echolocation.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat mortality resulting from actual or near-collision with operational wind turbine rotors is a phenomenon that is widespread but not well understood. Because bats rely on information contained in high-frequency echoes to determine the nature and movement of a target, it is important to consider how ultrasonic pulses similar to those used by bats for echolocation may be interacting with operational turbine rotor blades. By assessing the characteristics of reflected ultrasonic echoes, moving turbine blades operating under low wind speed conditions (&lt;6 m s−1) were found to produce distinct Doppler shift profiles at different angles to the rotor. Frequency shifts of up to ±700–800 Hz were produced, which may not be perceptible by some bat species. Monte Carlo simulation of bat-like sampling by echolocation revealed that over 50 rotor echoes could be required by species such as Pipistrellus pipistrellus for accurate interpretation of blade movement, which may not be achieved in the bat’s approach time-window. In summary, it was found that echoes returned from moving blades had features which could render them attractive to bats or which might make it difficult for the bat to accurately detect and locate blades in sufficient time to avoid a collision.",

However, little information exists about bats and their potential role as a reservoir of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in Colombia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in the kidneys of bats from the Caribbean region of Colombia deposited in the collection of mammals of the Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural (MPUJ-MAMM).\nMethodology: DNA was extracted from twenty-six kidney samples from a total of 13 species of bats captured in Colombia. First, 16S ribosomal RNA conventional PCR was performed to detect the presence of Leptospira spp. Then, in samples that tested positive, LipL32 PCR was performed to detect pathogenic Leptospira spp. by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.\nResults: The presence of Leptospira spp. was observed in 7/26 (26.9%) bats from the following 6 species: Carollia perspicillata, Glossophaga soricina, Dermanura phaeotis, Uroderma bilobatum, Desmodus rotundus, and Lophostoma silvicolum, and pathogenic Leptospira spp. were detected in 4/26 samples (15.4%).\nConclusions: This study suggests that bats present in the Caribbean region of Colombia could be potential reservoirs of pathogenic Leptospira spp.",

Mean body mass of the captured specimens was 4.25 ± 1.061 g, the head and body length was 35.00 ± 2.828 mm, the forearm was 28.00 ± 0.707 mm long. The greatest length of the skull was 10.19 mm and baculum was 3.46 mm long. Mean frequency of maximum energy of four pulses from two calls was 34.1 kHz and the calls were single harmonic. This paper also provides first hand information on the call parameters and status of this species from Pakistan.",

The species were first distinguished by their ultrasonic echolocation calls but also differ in other ways. It is proposed that the species with the lower-pitched call should be denoted by the name P. pipistrellus. and that the name P. pygmaeus (Leach, 1825), which has been regarded as a synonym of P. pipistrellus, should be used for the smaller species which calls at a higher frequency.",

            "abstractNote": "As bones age in most mammals, they typically become more fragile. This state of bone fragility is often associated with more homogenous collagen fiber orientations (CFO). Unlike most mammals, bats maintain mechanically competent bone throughout their lifespans, but little is known of positional and age-related changes in CFO within wing bones. This study tests the hypothesis that age-related changes in CFO in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) differ from those of the standard mammalian model for skeletal aging, the C57BL/6 laboratory mouse. We used data from quantitative polarized light microscopy (qPLM) to compare CFO across the lifespan of longlived big brown bats and age matched C57BL/6 mice. Eptesicus and C57BL/6 mice displayed idiosyncratic patterns of CFO. Consistent agerelated changes were only apparent in the outer cortical bone of Eptesicus, where bone tissue is more longitudinally arranged and more anisotropic in older individuals. Both taxa displayed a ring of more transversely oriented bone tissue surrounding the medullary cavity. In Eptesicus, this tissue represents a greater proportion of the overall cross-section, and is more clearly helically aligned (arranged at 45  to the bone long axis) than similar bone tissue in mice. Bat wing bones displayed a proximodistal gradient in CFO anisotropy and longitudinal orientation in both outer and inner cortical bone compartments. This study lays a methodological foundation for the quantitative evaluation of bone tissue architecture in volant and non-volant mammals that may be expanded in the future.",

            "abstractNote": "Area is generally assumed to affect speciation rates, but work on the spatial context of speciation has focused mostly on patterns of range overlap between emerging species rather than on questions of geographical scale. A variety of geographical theories of speciation predict that the probability of speciation occurring within a given region should (1) increase with the size of the region and (2) increase as the spatial extent of intraspeciﬁc gene ﬂow becomes smaller. Using a survey of speciation events on isolated oceanic islands for a broad range of taxa, we ﬁnd evidence for both predictions. The probability of in situ speciation scales with island area in bats, carnivorous mammals, birds, ﬂowering plants, lizards, butterﬂies and moths, and snails. Ferns are an exception to these ﬁndings, but they exhibit high frequencies of polyploid and hybrid speciation, which are expected to be scale independent. Furthermore, the minimum island size for speciation correlates across groups with the strength of intraspeciﬁc gene ﬂow, as is estimated from a meta-analysis of published population genetic studies. These results indicate a general geographical model of speciation rates that are dependent on both area and gene ﬂow. The spatial scale of population divergence is an important but neglected determinant of broad-scale diversity patterns.",

However, recent work in Michigan and Minnesota has shown that evening bats are becoming increasingly common in the region. After capture of a juvenile male evening bat in late summer 2015 in southern Rock County, Wisconsin, we radio-tracked three adult female evening bats in summer 2016 at the same Rock County location. These three bats were tracked to three roost trees with counts during evening emergence ranging from 20 to 103 bats. This work represents the first confirmed capture and roost site investigation for evening bats in Wisconsin and supports the idea this species is expanding its range.",

Away from these concentrated bat communities, bats are thought to make up an insignificant portion of owl diets. However, little research has investigated if bats perceive owls as a potential predatory threat. We conducted acoustic bat surveys to assess if bat activity was altered by the presence of owl calls or ambient nocturnal noise. Our surveys found no difference in the level of bat activity recorded before or during broadcasted owl calls or nocturnal noise. It is possible bats do not respond to calling owls because bats do not perceive owls as a threat. Additional studies may elucidate the relationship (if any) between bats and owls.",

We found 30 bats beneath turbines on cleared ground and gravel access areas in 2003 and 45 bats in 2004. After adjusting for search probability, search efficiency and scavenging rate, we estimated total bat mortality at 396 6 72 (95% CI) in 2003 and 636 6 112 (95% CI) in 2004. Although carcasses were mostly migratory tree bats, we found a considerable proportion of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus). We recorded 1465 bat echolocation call files at turbine sites (x 5 34.88 call files/detector-night) and 1536 bat call files at adjacent non-turbine sites (x 5 36.57 call files/detector-night). Bat activity did not differ significantly between turbine and non-turbine sites. A large proportion of recorded call files were made by Myotis sp. but this may be because we detected activity at ground level only. There was no relationship between types of turbine lights and either collision mortality or echolocation activity. The highest levels of bat echolocation activity and collision mortality were recorded during Jul. and Aug. during the autumn dispersal and migration period. The fatality rates for bats in general and little brown bats in particular were higher at the Top of Iowa Wind Resource Area than at other, comparable studies in the region. Future efforts to study behavior of bats in flight around turbines as well as cumulative impact studies should not ignore non-tree dwelling bats, generally regarded as minimally affected.",

            "abstractNote": "Reliable natural water sources often are unavailable for bats in semi-arid regions such as the Texas Panhandle. Metal stock tanks commonly are used to supply water to livestock and are used by bats as a water source. It is unknown how surface area, water level and adjacent vegetation influence use of tanks by bats. Infrared video cameras and supplemental infrared lights were used to video tape bat behavior and use of stock tanks in Palo Duro Canyon State Park, Texas. Treatment tanks were set out in pairs approximately 80 m apart in a cross-over design to account for influence of location on use of tanks by bats. Treatments included three sizes of tanks (1.2 m, 1.8 m and 3.0 m in diameter), three levels of cover of adjacent vegetation (no vegetation, light vegetation and heavy vegetation) and two water levels (full and K full). The number of bats that passed over 3.0 m and 1.2 m tanks was similar; however, bats drank from large tanks more than small tanks. Passes were similar between the tanks surrounded by light vegetation and tanks with no vegetation, but bats drank more from tanks surrounded by light vegetation. Tanks surrounded by heavy vegetation experienced fewer passes and fewer drinks than tanks without vegetation. Water level had no effect on the number of passes by bats but K full tanks were used for drinking less frequently than full tanks. Our research indicates that size of tank, water level in tanks and characteristics of adjacent vegetation influence use of metal livestock tanks by bats. Use of larger tanks, keeping tanks full and managing vegetation around tanks increases use of tanks by bats.",

Determining bat species composition in an area is a critical first step in managing for this important resource. Little information exists concerning the bat species composition of Maryland’s Coastal Plain, which is located on the northern periphery of the geographic ranges of five bat species occurring in the southeastern United States. We conducted mist net surveys for bats at Assateague Island National Seashore, a barrier island on Maryland’s coast, in summer 2005 and summer and autumn 2006. In 2005 we captured 133 bats representing three species, including two big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), 129 eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) and two purported Seminole bats (L. seminolus). In 2006 we captured 60 eastern red bats in summer and autumn combined. We used Anabat II bat detectors to conduct long-term acoustic monitoring on the island year round and documented three additional bat species, including silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), hoary bats (L. cinereus) and eastern pipistrelles (Pipistrellus subflavus). We documented silver-haired bats during spring and autumn, probably as they were migrating through the area. We used Anabat II bat detectors to conduct short-term monitoring of bat activity at five habitat types during summer 2005 and 2006 and found that total bat activity and eastern red bat activity were similar among forested areas, freshwater pools and bayside marshes. In shrublands, total bat activity and eastern red bat activity was higher than at beach areas, lower than in forested areas and similar at freshwater pools and bayside marshes. The loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) – dominated forests at ASIS provide roosting and foraging habitat mostly for eastern red bats, but also for other migratory bat species.",

The wind plant currently consists of 3 phases that total 354 turbines capable of generating 236 MW. During a study conducted from 1996–1999 to assess effects of wind power development on wildlife, 184 bat collision fatalities were documented within the wind plant. Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and eastern red bats (L. borealis) comprised most of the fatalities. After correcting bat fatality estimates for searcher efﬁciency and scavenger removal rates, we estimated that the number of bat fatalities per turbine ranged from 0.07 per y at the Phase 1 wind plant to 2.04 per y at the Phase 3 wind plant. The timing of mortalities, and other factors, suggest that most mortality involves migrant rather than resident breeding bats.",

Counts of hibernating C. raﬁnesquii ranged from 14–49, with summer colony size reaching a maximum of 118 bats. Bats roosted in different rooms of the cave in winter and summer. Temperatures in a room used in winter were consistently cooler and less stable than temperatures in the room used as the maternity site. Size of foraging areas ranged from 61.6–225.3 ha, and distance of foraging areas from the roost varied from 0.12–1.22 km. We detected no bat Ͼ2.5 km from the roost of capture. Bats foraged along ridgelines supporting upland oak-hickory forest.",

In August 2004, however, we discovered a maternity colony consisting of at least 68 evening bats in Lenawee County, Michigan. The colony is located over 300 km from the nearest extant colony in Hendricks County, Indiana, and it is the northernmost on the continent. The lack of a large continuous riparian corridor, lined with suitable bottomland forest and connecting the Ohio River with the southern Great Lakes area, probably contributes to the rarity of evening bats across northern Indiana, northern Ohio and southern Michigan.",

            "abstractNote": "The role of bats as potential sources of transmission to humans or as maintenance hosts of leptospires is poorly understood. We quantified the prevalence of leptospiral colonization in bats in the Peruvian Amazon in the vicinity of Iquitos, an area of high biologic diversity. Of 589 analyzed bats, culture (3 of 589) and molecular evidence (20 of 589) of leptospiral colonization was found in the kidneys, yielding an overall colonization rate of 3.4%. Infection rates differed with habitat and location, and among different bat species. Bayesian analysis was used to infer phylogenic relationships of leptospiral 16S ribosomal DNA sequences. Tree topologies were consistent with groupings based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies. A diverse group of leptospires was found in peri-Iquitos bat populations including Leptospira interrogans (5 clones), L. kirschneri (1), L. borgpetersenii (4), L. fainei (1), and two previously undescribed leptospiral species (8). Although L. kirschenri and L. interrogans have been previously isolated from bats, this report is the first to describe L. borgpetersenii and L. fainei infection of bats. A wild animal reservoir of L. fainei has not been previously described. The detection in bats of the L. interrogans serovar Icterohemorrhagiae, a leptospire typically maintained by peridomestic rats, suggests a rodent-bat infection cycle. Bats in Iquitos maintain a genetically diverse group of leptospires. These results provide a solid basis for pursuing molecular epidemiologic studies of bat-associated Leptospira, a potentially new epidemiologic reservoir of transmission of leptospirosis to humans.",

It contains high biodiversity values with previous records of many precious animal and plant species. However, biodiversity of Sop Cop is threatened by illegal activities of local people. In fact, bats and many other animal taxa in this area were poorly studied and rarely documented in previous publications. Between June 2014 and October 2016, the author conducted a variety of field surveys on bats in the Sop Cop Special Use Forest for understanding of their diversity and conservation status. The results indicated that the study area is a home to at least 36 bat species belonging to 20 genera, 6 families. Among them, 19 species are new to the area, 3 species are listed in the 2007 Red Data Book of Vietnam which must be considered for conservation priority in the future.",
