            "abstractNote": "In Neotropical forests fruits are key resources for a great diversity of vertebrates, including many frugivorous bats, but little is known about the factors that determine their availability. We studied forest inundation and river banks as determinants of the spatial variation in the availability of fruits for bats in lowland Amazonia. We sampled the bat assemblage composition, fruit availability, and bat diet in terra firme upland forest and in two types of flooded forest — várzea and igapó. Two distinct frugivore bat guilds were found in both terra firme and flooded forests: (1) canopy frugivores, feeding mainly on Ficus and Cecropia, and (2) understorey frugivores that feed mainly on Vismia and Piper. Fruits consumed by the canopy guild were more abundant in the flooded forests — particularly in the nutrient-rich várzea, but those dominating the understory guild diet were most abundant in terra firme. Availability of both fruit genera most consumed by the canopy guild was greater along river banks than in the forest matrix. For the understory guild, the greater abundance of Vismia along river banks was compensated for by a higher availability of Piper in the matrix. In conclusion, both factors influence the availability of fruits, although differently for the canopy and understory guilds. The resulting differences in fruit abundance may explain variations in bat assemblages of the different forest types. River banks play a particularly important role in providing food for bats of both guilds, but are under particularly heavy human pressure.",

Foods of bats (Family Vespertilionidae) at five locations in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Canadian Field-Naturalist 126(2): 117–124. Diet and feeding relations of six species of bats at five locations in New Hampshire and Massachusetts were studied to improve understanding of foraging niche differentiation. Fecal samples were collected from 100 Big Brown Bats (Eptesicus fuscus), 154 Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus), 49 Northern Myotis (M. septentrionalis), 54 Eastern Small-footed Myotis (M. leibii), 9 Eastern Red Bats (Lasiurus borealis), and 1 Hoary Bat (L. cinereus) netted during non-hibernation periods from 2004 to 2008 at four locations in southern New Hampshire and one in north-central Massachusetts. Beetles (Order Coleoptera) were the major food of E. fuscus (mean percentage volume = 81.6%, 97% occurrence) followed by moths (Order Lepidoptera), with scarabaeid and carabid beetles the most abundant consumed families by volume and frequency. Moths were the most important item by volume and frequency preyed on by the remaining species (M. lucifugus, mean percentage volume 30.7%, 82% occurrence; M. septentrionalis, mean percentage volume 42.7%, 82% occurrence; M. leibii, mean percentage volume 49.4%, 81% occurrence; L. borealis, mean percentage volume 62.8%, 100% occurrence; L. cinereus, mean percentage volume 82%, 100% occurrence). Little Brown Myotis consumed the largest variety of prey (40); Northern Myotis consumed the highest volume of spiders (8.1%). Community similarity index values indicated diets of the three species of Myotis were more similar to each other (similarity = 0.71) than to those of non-Myotis. The diet of E. fuscus was more similar to that of the Myotis cluster (0.58) than to either species of Lasiurus. Results suggest that, despite faunal differences between the U.S. Northeast and other parts of North America, foraging relationships among guild members follows a similar pattern.",

            "abstractNote": "Neotropical frugivorous bats display a trophic structure composed of bat species with dietary preferences of core plant taxa (Artibeus-Ficus + Cecropia, Carollia-Piper, Sturnira- Solanum + Piper). This structure is hypothesized to be an ancestral trait, suggesting that similar diets would be observed throughout a species' range. However, most evidence comes from lowlands where data from montane habitats are scarce. In high mountain environments both diversity of bats and plants decreases with altitude; such decline in plant diversity produces less plants to feed from, which should ultimately aﬀect the trophic structure of frugivorous bats in mountain environments. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the diet of frugivorous bats in Neotropical montane environments and evaluate their trophic structure in middle and higher elevations by combining a literature database with ﬁeld data. We use the concept of modularity to test whether frugivorous montane bats have dietary preferences on core plant taxa. Our database revealed 47 species of montane bats feeding on 211 plant species. We ﬁnd that the networks are modular, reﬂecting the trophic structure previously reported. We also found that in highlands the tribe Ectophyllini are Cecropia + Cavendishia-specialists rather than Ficus-specialists, and we describe new interactions reﬂecting 14 species of plants, including three botanical families previously not reported to be consumed by bats.",

But in recent weeks, large new population studies have cemented the association and demonstrated that even people who are merely overweight are at higher risk for severe consequences from coronavirus infection. For example, researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, pooled data from scores of papers capturing 399,000 patients. Their analysis, published last month in\n              Obesity Reviews\n              , found that people with obesity who contracted SARS-CoV-2 were 113% more likely than people of healthy weight to land in the hospital, 74% more likely to be admitted to intensive care, and 48% more likely to die. The reasons include weakened immunity, clot-prone blood and chronic inflammation in people with obesity. And the poor outcomes \"may be one reason for the devastating impact of COVID-19 in the United States, where 40% of adults are obese,\" says Anne Dixon, a physician-scientist who studies obesity and lung disease at the University of Vermont.",

Diversity is also functionally important, both because it increases the probability of including species that have strong ecosystem effects and because it can increase the efficiency of resource use. Differences in environmental sensitivity among functionally similar species give stability to ecosystem processes, whereas differences in sensitivity among functionally different species make ecosystems more vulnerable to change. Current global environmental changes that affect species composition and diversity are therefore profoundly altering the functioning of the biosphere.",

Collections were conducted in four forest fragments, during 272 hours, on 48 m2 of nets and roosting sites; the total capture effort was 1.52.103 h.m2. Eight species (247 individuals) were registered: Artibeus lituratus (Olfers, 1818), Sturnira lilium (E. Geoffroy, 1810), Desmodus rotundus (E. Geoffroy, 1810) (Phyllostomidae); Tadarida brasiliensis (Desmarest, 1819), Eumops auripendulus (Shaw, 1800) (Molossidae); Eptesicus brasiliensis (Shaw, 1800), Myotis nigricans (Schinz, 1821), and Histiotus velatus (I. Geoffroy, 1824) (Vespertilionidae). The Phyllostomidae family was the most frequently captured. Solanaceae, Moraceae, Piperaceae, and Rosaceae were found in the diet of frugivores; six orders of insects and the class Arachnida were found in the diets of insectivores. Pregnant females were found in September and October and lactating ones in November and December. The collection peak was reached in the second hour-and-a-half. Preservation of the regional forested and altered areas is required for survival of the local chiropterofauna.",

Controversially discussed solutions include wildlife-friendly farming or combining high-intensity farming with land-sparing for nature. Here, we integrate biodiversity and crop productivity data for smallholder cacao in Indonesia to exemplify for tropical agroforests that there is little relationship between yield and biodiversity under current management, opening substantial opportunities for wildlife-friendly management. Species richness of trees, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates did not decrease with yield. Moderate shade, adequate labor, and input level can be combined with a complex habitat structure to provide high biodiversity as well as high yields. Although livelihood impacts are held up as a major obstacle for wildlife-friendly farming in the tropics, our results suggest that in some situations, agroforests can be designed to optimize both biodiversity and crop production benefits without adding pressure to convert natural habitat to farmland.",

            "abstractNote": "The emerging wildlife disease white-nose syndrome (WNS) affects both physiology and behaviour of hibernating bats. Infection with the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), the ﬁrst pathogen known to target torpid animals, causes an increase in arousal frequency during hibernation, and therefore premature depletion of energy stores. Infected bats also show a dramatic decrease in clustering behaviour over the winter. To investigate the interaction between disease progression and torpor expression we quantiﬁed physiological (i.e., timing of arousal, rewarming rate) and behavioural (i.e., arousal synchronisation, clustering) aspects of rewarming events over four months in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) experimentally inoculated with Pd. We tested two competing hypotheses: 1) Bats adjust arousal physiology adaptively to help compensate for an increase in energetically expensive arousals. This hypothesis predicts that infected bats should increase synchronisation of arousals with colony mates to beneﬁt from social thermoregulation and/or that solitary bats will exhibit faster rewarming rates than clustered individuals because rewarming costs fall as rewarming rate increases. 2) As for the increase in arousal frequency, changes in arousal physiology and clustering behaviour are maladaptive consequences of infection. This hypothesis predicts no effect of infection or clustering behaviour on rewarming rate and that disturbance by normothermic bats contributes to the overall increase in arousal frequency. We found that arousals of infected bats became more synchronised than those of controls as hibernation progressed but the pattern was not consistent with social thermoregulation. When a bat rewarmed from torpor, it was often followed in sequence by up to seven other bats in an arousal “cascade”. Moreover, rewarming rate did not differ between infected and uninfected bats, was not affected by clustering and did not change over time. Our results support our second hypothesis and suggest that disturbance, not social thermoregulation, explains the increased synchronisation of arousals. Negative pathophysiological effects of WNS on energy conservation may therefore be compounded by maladaptive changes in behaviour of the bats, accelerating fat depletion and starvation.",

            "abstractNote": "Previous work has shown that tree turnover, tree biomass and large liana densities have increased in mature tropical forest plots in the late twentieth century. These results point to a concerted shift in forest ecological processes that may already be having significant impacts on terrestrial carbon stocks, fluxes and biodiversity. However, the findings have proved controversial, partly because a rather limited number of permanent plots have been monitored for rather short periods. The aim of this paper is to characterize regional–scale patterns of ‘tree turnover’ (the rate with which trees die and recruit into a population) by using improved datasets now available for Amazonia that span the past 25 years. Specifically, we assess whether concerted changes in turnover are occurring, and if so whether they are general throughout the Amazon or restricted to one region or environmental zone. In addition, we ask whether they are driven by changes in recruitment, mortality or both. We find that: (i) trees 10 cm or more in diameter recruit and die twice as fast on the richer soils of southern and western Amazonia than on the poorer soils of eastern and central Amazonia; (ii) turnover rates have increased throughout Amazonia over the past two decades; (iii) mortality and recruitment rates have both increased significantly in every region and environmental zone, with the exception of mortality in eastern Amazonia; (iv) recruitment rates have consistently exceeded mortality rates; (v) absolute increases in recruitment and mortality rates are greatest in western Amazonian sites; and (vi) mortality appears to be lagging recruitment at regional scales. These spatial patterns and temporal trends are not caused by obvious artefacts in the data or the analyses. The trends cannot be directly driven by a mortality driver (such as increased drought or fragmentation–related death) because the biomass in these forests has simultaneously increased. Our findings therefore indicate that long–acting and widespread environmental changes are stimulating the growth and productivity of Amazon forests.",

            "abstractNote": "In tropical rain forests of Central America, the canopy tree Dipteryx panamensis (Papilionaceae) fruits when overall fruit biomass is low for mammals. Flying and arboreal consumers feed on D. panamensis and drop seeds under the parent or disperse them farther away. Seeds on the ground attract many vertebrate seed-eaters, some of them potential secondary seed dispersers. The fate of seeds artificially distributed to simulate bat dispersal was studied in relation to fruitfall periodicity and the visiting frequency of diurnal rodents at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. The frequency of visits by agoutis is very high at the beginning of fruitfall, but in the area close (< 50 m) to fruiting trees (Dipteryx-rich area) it declines throughout fruiting, whereas it remains unchanged farther (> 50 m) away (Dipteryx-poor and Gustavia-rich area). Squirrels were usually observed in the Dipteryx-rich area. Along with intense post-dispersal seed predation by rodents in the Dipteryx-rich area, a significant proportion of seeds were cached by rodents in the Dipteryx-poor area. Post-dispersal seed predation rate was inversely related to hoarding rate. A significantly greater proportion of seeds was cached in March, especially more than 100 m from the nearest fruiting tree. This correlates with the mid-fruiting period, i.e. during the height of D. panamensis fruiting, when rodents seem to be temporarily satiated with the food supply at parent trees. Hoarding remained high toward April, i.e. late in the fruiting season of D. panamensis. Low survival of scatterhoarded seeds suggests that the alternative food supply over the animal's home-ranges in May-June 1990 was too low to promote survival of cached seeds. Seedlings are assumed to establish in the less-used area of the rodents' home-range when overall food supply is sufficient to satiate post-~tispersal predators.",

I investigated whether these patterns also occurred in a Philippine montane rainforest and adjacent successional vegetation. I also asked whether seed mass was related to probability of dispersal between habitats. A greater number of woody species and stems in the forest produced vertebrate-dispersed seeds than wind-dispersed seeds. Although input of forest seeds into the successional area was dominated by vertebrate-dispersed seeds in terms of species richness, wind-dispersed seeds landed in densities 15 times higher. Frugivorous birds dispersed more forest seeds and species into the successional area than bats, and more successional seeds and species into the forest. As expected, seed input declined with distance from source habitat. Low input of forest seeds into the successional area at the farthest distance sampled, 40 m from forest edge, particularly for vertebrate-dispersed seeds, suggests very limited dispersal out of forest even into a habitat in which woody successional vegetation provides perches and fruit resources. For species of vertebrate-dispersed successional seeds, probability of dispersal into forest declined significantly with seed mass.",

            "abstractNote": "A comparative study was conducted on the recruitment patterns of two non-pioneer tree species, one dispersed by arboreal mammals and birds (Virola michelii, Myristicaceae) and the other by rodents (Moronobea coecinea, Clusiaceae). These species differ in fruiting phenology, seed size, dispersal distance, germination time and seed nutrient exhaustion. In both species, establishment patterns were consistent with the escape hypothesis and the Janzen-Connell model. Virola seeds need not be buried to survive and germinate, and may produce a seedling carpet beneath the parent. Moronobea seedlings only establish from seeds buried by scatterhoarding rodents in the surrounding understory. One-year survival of Virola seedlings was 47.8% and was greater > 10 m than < 10 m from the largest parent tree. In contrast, survival of Moronobea seedlings was 56% 3 years after seed dispersal. Survival of juveniles was greater in gaps than in the understory for Virola but not for Moronobea. Moronobea survival was greater than Virola survival in both microhabitats. Both species establish in the understory, yet both grew faster in gaps. Virola appeared to be more gap-dependent than Moronobea which may persist several years in the understory until a gap occurs. Virola and Moronobea illustrate two intermediate recruitment patterns along an hypothetical continuum of nonpioneer species replacement (Bazzaz and Pickett 1980; Swaine and Whitmore 1988).",

Among Neotropical bats that feed primarily on plant parts (fruits, nectar, pollen, and flowers), animal parts (insects and vertebrates), or both, differences in measured concentrations of nutrients are present in feces. Nitrogen levels are markedly higher and sodium levels are marginally higher in feces of carnivores and omnivores than in frugivores. Calcium levels are higher and potassium levels are lower in feces of bats that primarily consume insects. Total iron levels in feces of frugivorous species are marginally lower than in carnivores or omnivores. Magnesium concentrations seem unrelated to feeding habits. Intake of nitrogen, potassium, and magnesium appears to be adequate for bats of all feeding habits. Periodic deficiencies for calcium exist for insectivorous species and for sodium, and possibly iron, in some frugivorous species.",

There was a significant positive correlation between the logarithm of species richness and the logarithm of cave surface area, evidence of a species-area relationship. Our data suggest that roost site diversity, as indicated by spatial variation in relative humidity and presence of avons (conical depressions in cave ceilings) is a cause of the species-area relationship.",

Data fromthese species are compatible with the hypothesis that the karyotype of Macrotus waterhousii is most like that primitive forthe family Phyllostomatidae(Pattonand Baker,1979).The karyotype of these five genera can be derived from that of Macrotus waterhousii by five pericentric inversions, seven fusions, and one fission. If the primitive karyotypeforthe family Phyllostomatidae is similar to that of M. waterhousii, then these members of the Glossophaginae and the Brachyphyllinae have shared a common ancestor after evolving this highly derived karyotype. These data cast doubt on the validity of the subfamily Brachyphyllinae,which may be more properlyclassified as a subtaxonof the Glossophaginae.The magnitudeof classical morphologicalvariationandthe magnitude of chromosomalvariationdo not appearto be correlated.",

We quantiﬁed total aboveground dry biomass (TAGB) in undisturbed central Amazonian rainforests, based on detailed estimates of all live and dead plant material within 20 1 ha plots spanning an extensive (ca. 1000 km2) study area. TAGB values in our study area were very high, averaging 397:7 Æ 30:0 Mg haÀ1. The most important component of aboveground biomass was large (!10 cm diameter-at-breast-height (DBH)) trees, which comprised 81.9% of TAGB, followed by downed wood debris (7.0%), small trees, saplings, and seedlings (<10 cm DBH; 5.3%), lianas (2.1%), litter (1.9%), snags (1.5%), and stemless palms (0.3%). Among large trees, aboveground biomass was greatest in intermediate-sized (20–50 cm DBH) stems (46.7% of TAGB), with very large (!60 cm DBH) trees also containing substantial biomass (13.4% of TAGB). There were no signiﬁcant correlations between large tree biomass and that of any other live or dead biomass component. An analysis based on the variability of our samples suggested that just 3–4 randomly positioned 1 ha plots would be sufﬁcient to provide a reasonable estimate of mean TAGB in a landscape such as ours (with 95% conﬁdence intervals being <10% of the mean). This suggests that efforts to quantify Amazon forest biomass should be extensive rather than intensive; researchers should sample many geographically separate areas with a few plots each, rather than sampling a small number of areas more intensively.",

Cecropia,with 61 species presentlyrecognized,is the largestgenusof the Cecropiaceae.Itis a genusof pioneertrees in the more or less humid partsof the Neotropics.The majorityof the species are myrmecophytic. The genus is characterizedby some unusualtraits:spathesfully enclosing the flower-bearingpartsof the inflorescencesuntilanthesis,patchesof denseindumentum (trichilia)producingMuillerian(food) bodies at the base of the petiole, and anthersbecoming detachedat anthesis.The ecological role of the genus andits associationwithants have been the subjectof numerousstudies,most of themcited in the presentmonograph. Althoughthe taxonomyhas been sortedout reasonablywell, the coverageby collections and field notes are still insufficientin many cases to fully understandmorphologicaland ecological variationand plasticity in relationto taxonomic delimitations,and in several cases, to preparecomplete descriptions.The introductorychapterdeals with taxonomic history, morphology,ecology, plant-animalrelations,pollination,dispersal,distribution, classification,diversification,use, vernacularnames, and conservation.Myrmecophilyin Cecropiais treatedin a separatechapter(by Davidson).
