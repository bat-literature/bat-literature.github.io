            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Bats are unusual mammals in being small but having long lives and small litters (typically only one or two young). I hypothesize that litter size is constrained by the need to raise young to near adult size before they can be independent. Our studies, and those of others, on a variety of species of bats indicate that juveniles typically start to fly at over 70% of adult mass and over 95% of adult skeletal size. This constraint appears to be associated with flight in vertebrates, since young birds also do not fly until fully grown. This means that each young is very costly and restricts the number that can be raised. Although energetic demands may be the proximate constraint, I argue that calcium is more important. For bats, calcium demand on reproductive females is high and calcium availability in most diets (insects, fruit, pollen) is low. Birds can at least partially overcome this by supplementing their diet with calcium-rich inanimate objects that are unavailable to bats because of their inability to forage on the ground and detect such items. This may help to explain why the reproductive output of birds exceeds that of bats. If the hypothesis is correct, bat foraging strategies may be based on the calcium content of prey in addition to energy content, and female and male foraging strategies may be based on different currencies. Vertebrate-pollinated and seed-dispersed plants may attract bats by offering high calcium rewards. In addition, however, it would mean that flight could only have evolved in bats in association with long lifespans, thereby constraining the possible life histories available to these mammals.",

Bats from a woodland site generally emerged earlier than did bats from an exposed roost, except in early spring when tree leaf cover was minimal. Foliage around the roost may benefit bats by extending foraging time and reducing predation. Bats older than one year foraged between 2 and 4 km from their day roosts. Hence conservation of foraging habitats within this range is important. Ancient semi-natural deciduous woodland was used intensively by foraging bats during spring, while during late summer the bats fed mainly over pasture. Woodland was usually warmer than pasture, and the relative temperature difference between the two habitats was greatest at low temperatures. Insect abundance increased rapidly above 6-10 °C. Hence, in spring, it may be more profitable for bats to forage in woodland. The shift to feeding over pasture was associated with the dominance of Aphodius dung beetles in the diet during summer. Juveniles foraged independently of their mothers before weaning. Prime foraging habitat close to the maternity roost is probably important to initial and long-term juvenile survival. The hibernation requirements of R. ferrumequinum are briefly reviewed. Insights into the foraging needs (e.g. commuting distances) of other species may be gained from predictions based on flight morphology.",

            "abstractNote": "A study of the abundance of cavities in Eucalyptus regnans, Eucalyptus delegatensis, Eucalyptus nitens, Eucalyptus obliqua and Eucalyptus cypellocarpa is described. The investigation used a database of 2315 living and dead trees with cavities, measured on 523 sites each of 3 ha throughout the montane ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, southeastern Australia. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between the number and type of cavities and a range of attributes of trees. These analyses demonstrated that, for all species of trees, the abundance of holes, fissures and hollow branches increased with tree diameter. Log-linear analysis of contingency tables demonstrated that various combinations of cavity types typically occur. Patterns of co-occurrence of cavities changed significantly according to the diameter, height and form of trees. The application of restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) for examining multi-level data, enabled the relationships between the number of cavities, tree characteristics and site parameters to be analysed concurrently. The characteristics of trees that were important were height, diameter and form. Site parameters that had a significant influence on the total number of cavities in trees included slope, latitude and stand age. This highlights the range of factors, at several measured spatial scales, that may influence the development of cavities in Eucalyptus trees. Although the various relationships derived in this study were highly significant, the statistical models had limited predictive ability. Thus, for any given tree the development of cavities will be influenced by site and tree attributes as well as highly stochastic episodic events that may occur during its lifetime. The key findings from the study are discussed in terms of their relevance to forest wildlife management.",

A total of 45 individuals of N. geoﬀroyi and 27 C. gouldii were ﬁtted with radio transmitters, which resulted in the location of 139 and 89 roosts respectively. Selection of roosting habitat showed both inter- and intra-speciﬁc diﬀerences. At the landscape level, locations of roosts used by male and female N. geoﬀroyi diﬀered markedly. Most males roosted in the farmland mosaic within 3 km (mean 1.9 Æ 2.9 km) of where they were captured while foraging in remnant vegetation. In contrast, roost sites of females were predominantly in the ﬂoodplain forest, 6–12 km from their capture site in farmland (mean for all females, 6.7 Æ 2.9 km). All maternity roosts were in the extensive ﬂoodplain forest, 4–10 km from foraging areas. Distances moved by this species were greater than previously recorded and further than predicted by ﬂight morphology. Most C. gouldii roosted in the ﬂoodplain forest, 4–10 km from their capture site (6.9Æ 1.6 km). Within the ﬂoodplain forest, both species roosted in areas that had higher densities of hollow-bearing trees than generally available; dead hollow-bearing trees for N. geoﬀroyi and large, live trees for C. gouldii. The scale of movements undertaken by these species means that they can obtain resources from multiple landscape elements. Both species used diﬀerent habitats for roosting and foraging despite the energetic costs of commuting relatively large distances. Conservation of bat populations in rural environments needs to be considered at the landscape scale, with particular attention to identifying landscape elements that provide key resources. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using radiotelemetry, we located 39 roosts, 10 of which were maternity aggregations containing 6 to 55 bats. The roosts were mostly in ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa) snags that averaged 39 cm diameter at breast height. Solitary bats preferred roosting under loose bark or in crevices in trees, regularly moving among trees. All maternity aggregations were found in tree cavities, primarily those created by woodpeckers. Roost trees were located in patches of forest with relatively high snag densities, about 21 snags/ha. This study suggests that snags play an important role in maintaining silver-haired bat populations in ponderosa pine ecosystems.",

Elevational gradients of 305-4340 m, combined with limited human development, f interest of natural history and faunal distributions in this range. We found 13 bat species in the cour tions. Three of these species, the spotted bat (Euderma maculatum), silver-haired bat ( Lasionycter hoary bat ( Lasiurus cinereus), have no previous records from the White-Inyo Range. We found b zones except the alpine, 3500-4342 m. Despite an abundance of mines in this range, only Town (Corynorhinus townsendii) and the western small-footed myotis (Myotis ciliolabrum) used them rou indicated the importance of surface water to bat populations in arid regions.",

            "abstractNote": "The short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx, begins to visit fruitbearing trees about 30 min after sunset. Individual bats often hover near or land on fruits or on nearby branches to remove whole or parts of fruits with their mouth. These bats seldom remain in the fruit-bearing trees to feed, but instead carry fruits to feeding roosts, repeating this behaviour several times throughout the night. Analysis of the temporal distribution of feeding behaviour has revealed two peaks of activity, one in the pre-midnight hours when bats fed mostly on 'steady state' fruits, and another during the post-midnight hours when bats fed on 'big-bang' fruits. Only solitary bats visited and fed on species with steady state fruiting phenologies, whereas groups of bats regularly visited and fed on species with big-bang fruiting phenologies. Thus, plant species which produce large numbers of fruits appear to promote group foraging during the latter hours of the night. It is suggested that the temporal use of available fruits in south India made it possible for C. sphinx to successfully exploit them, and thereby reduced interference competition with conspecifics.",

The sections on human impact have been extended to include a new global assessment of deforestation as well as details of new research on biodiversity and conservation. Discussion of the future of the rain forests and priorities for action is incorporated. The book remains unique in linking rain forest biology and ecology with silviculture, and with concerns over sustainable resource utilization and the future of the tropical rain forests. It includes sections on the diverse animal and plant life forms which are found in the rain forest, and the interconnections between them. Nutrient cycles and forest dynamics are fully explained, with new data on ecophysiology and forest microclimates. The geologic and climatic history of rain forests, and the wide-spread canopy disturbances now understood to have occurred in the past, are explored. Accessibly written, and illustrated throughout with line-drawings and photographs, this is a must for biology and geography students, and anyone else who seeks to know more about the nature and importance of the world's tropical rain forests.",

Most of the trapped bats were banded and released. Little brown bats of both sexes emerged gradually from hibernation between 14 March and 19 May 1990 and between 15 March and 1 May 1991. In contrast, northern bats emerged in much larger numbers between 9 March and 27 April 1990 and between 21 February and 22 April 1991. The mine served as a swarming area from the end of July to the end of October for both species of Myotis and through the first week of October for the pipistrelles. The pipistrelles exhibited almost no winter activity (flight). However, the little brown bats and the northern bats were active at the mine entrance throughout the winter. Turnover in the bat populations of this mine is quite high, as indicated by the low number of banded bats recovered: 336 of 1733 (19.4%) individuals of Myotis lucifugus; 174 of 2090 (8.3%) individuals of M. septentrionalis; and 100 of 546 (18.3%) individuals of Pipistrellus subflavus.",

To evaluate routing as a technique, cavities were routed in 48 red maples (Acer rubrum),.48 northern red oaks (Quercus rubra), and 48 white oaks (Quercus alba). After 3 years, 139 trees were still structurally sound, but 5 red maples had fractured at the routing site. About a third of the cavities contained standing water; 18% were closed by callus. Partially closed cavities (about 80% of all cavities) were used by southern flying squirrels (Glaucomnys volans) for feeding and denning. Further research is needed before routing can be recommended as a habitat management technique.",

Artibeus anderseni alters the shape of Heliconia leaves by cutting the lateral nerves and interconnected tissue extending out from the midrib. Artibeus glaucus cuts the basal lateral nerves in Xanthosoma, causing the two sides of the leaf to collapse downward around the midrib. Artibeus phaeotis cuts the lateral nerves and interconnected tissues in both banana and Heliconia imbricata; the basal cuts veer out from the midrib such that a distinctive V-shaped enclosure is formed by the hanging leaf Artibeus toltecus cuts the basal nerves on Anthurium, causing the sides of the leaf to fold down around the midrib to form a pyramidshaped tent. Artibeus watsoni was found to make four distinctive styles of tents, including simple V-shaped cuts on bifurcated palms, cuts of a few side veins on aroids to produce a rounded pyramid, elongate J-shaped cuts on banana and Heliconia, and polygonal cuts on Carludovica palmata. Artibeus watsoni has the greatest repertoire in tent styles, and uses the most diverse array of plant species and leaf shapes. Two styles of tents constructed by Uroderma bilobatum are reported for the first time, one on the large pinnately leafed palm Scheelea rostrata and the second on banana. The common denominator between the Uroderma bilobatum tents reported herein and those previously described is that all are on large, broad leaves and all have a distinctive V-shaped pattern cut by the bats. Uroderma magnirostrum also creates an inverted elongate V-shaped tent on pinnately leafed palms. All New World tent-makers described to date are tropical members of the phyllostomid subfamily Stenoderminae. Each species of tent-making bat has one or more distinctive style of tent. Bats select leaves of specific shapes, sizes, and angles for tent construction. Most species appear to be obligate tent- roosters. Tents provide bats with a cryptic diurnal roost site, in addition to providing shelter from both the sun and rain and an early warning to the approach of predators.",

            "abstractNote": "The seasonal movements of Eidolon helvum, Myonycteris torquata, and Nanonycteris veldkampi were studied over a 2-year period in West Africa. During the dry season, E. helvum roosts in at least one large colony (ca. 500 000 individuals) in the southern forest zone of Ivory Coast. Following the birth of young in February, males and females move into the savanna zones, and the progressive establishment and decline of colonies along a south–north axis indicates that E. helvum migrates at least to the Niger River basin by the middle of the wet season (July). During the dry season, both M. torquata and N. veldkampi are absent from savanna sites, but are common in the forest zone. With the onset of the rainy season in March, catch rates of both species increase first at a southern Guinea savanna site and subsequently at a savanna site 400 km to the north, indicating that both species migrate at least to the southern Sudanese savanna zone during the wet season. Both sexes of N. veldkampi migrate, but the migration of M. torquata is restricted to the immature male cohorts. I argue that the high amplitude of the seasonal fluctuations in fruit abundance at savanna sites creates a wet-season surplus of food which results in low intra- and inter-specific competition levels at these sites relative to the forest zone. This may provide the conditions leading to the observed annual migrations.",

These are associated with a wide variety of different forms of m ate guarding, including the defence of feeding and m ating territories, the defence of female groups and the defence of individual receptive females. Female m ating bonds include long-term monogamy, serial monogamy, polyan­ dry and prom iscuity. Both male and female m ating behaviour varies widely w ithin species. V ariation in male m atin g behaviour is related to th e effect of male assistance in rearing young and to th e defensibility of females by males. The la tte r is, in tu rn , related to female ranging behaviour and to the size and stability of female groups. Much of the variation in m am m alian m ating bonds and systems of m ate guarding can be attributed to differences in these three variables.",

            "abstractNote": "Nectar feeding behavior of the short-nosed bat, Cynopterus sphinx, was observed under natural conditions in South India. Nectar production of 'steady-state' flowers of Musa ´ paradisiaca and 'big-bang' flowers of Bassia latifolia was quantified. Cynopterus sphinx typically foraged alone on flowers of M. ´ paradisiaca and as groups on B. latifolia, largely in response to the availability of these floral resources. Peak visits on flowers of M. ´ paradisiaca by C. sphinx occurred at 2000 h and on B. latifolia at 2100 h. Peak visits coincided with the maximum nectar production and sugar concentration of these floral resources. In addition to feeding on nectar early in the evening, C. sphinx acquired additional energy by feeding on carbohydrate-rich fruit. In return for these food resources, C. sphinx provides important pollination and seed-dispersal services to the plants that they visit nightly, and thus can profoundly influence the co-evolution of plants and bats.",

            "abstractNote": "From March to October colonies of Nyctalus noctula were found in hollow trees where also the reproduction takes place; winter colonies in trees are evidenced by oldish material. In buildings these bats were found throughout the year with the exception of June and July, and they do not reproduce there. One winter colony was found in a crack in a rock. According to the authors' material and according to data in literature the relation of different components of populations to different types of shelters is evaluated as well as the behaviour of N. n. in their hunting grounds. In Central Europe all females and most of the males mature at the age of about 3 months, i. e., immediately after finishing their growth. Most females older than 1 year have 2 young and the average number of young per one grown-up female is 1.8. The sex ratio at birth is 1:1 and is probably also maintained later on. The young are born from mid-June till early July and nursery co­ lonies disintegrate in August. Old females as well as those born in that year move to mating quarters to territorial old males. The males of that year do not mate and in juvenile colonies they gradually exceed the females in number. In October at the latest the summer shelters are left till March or April. Males prevail in all winter samples from Western and Central Europe; the possible causes of this phenomenon are being discussed. The average population density in the summer season, found in two areas of the optimum habitat, is 0.32 individuals per ha. Although originally a forest species, N. noctula has managed to adapt to the civilization pressure and in places it exhibits a trend towards a hemisynanthropic way of life.",
