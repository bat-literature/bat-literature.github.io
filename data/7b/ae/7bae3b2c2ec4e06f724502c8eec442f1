Mist netting was conducted over a period of five months in two secondary forest sites, where 211 unique individuals were captured and examined for ectoparasites. The relative density, prevalence and mean intensity of parasitism by the wingless nycteriibid Leptocyclopodia ferrarii ferrarii were compared with respect to sex, age and reproductive status of captured bats. The overall prevalence of parasitism was 40.3% and analyses revealed no significant differences in the three parameters when comparisons were made between demographic subgroups. However, adults, females and pregnant females had a higher prevalence of infestation, while juveniles, males and non-pregnant females had higher mean intensity of bat flies. Roosting behavior is likely to be the driving factor for parasite transmission, as bat flies are more likely to encounter females because of C. brachyotis’ harembased social structure. No correlation was found between bat body condition and parasite load, even when the relationship was examined for juveniles and adults separately. The observation of a re-infestation within 46 days suggests that there is high intraindividual and intra-roost parasite transmission. Research into roost group size, distribution, site fidelity, and connectivity is needed to better understand the patterns and dynamics of parasitism on bats living in the urban environment.",

We characterized the recording variability among three batcorders placed in proximate vicinity (ca. 10 m apart) to each other at 157 sites in Austria (central Europe). We found this variability perplexingly high, both for bat activity and species richness estimates. Specifically, the ratio of the highest to the lowest total sequence length (all species combined) was over fivefold in 23%, and over tenfold in 8% of the sites. In only 17% of the sites, we found the same number of species for all three devices — in most sites it varied between one and five species. The maximum call ranges of the recorded bat species affected the recording variability between the devices only for short ranges (5 m) but showed similar or relatively low variability for longer ranges. There was significantly less recording variability in sites with no woody vegetation present than in sites with open to dense vegetation structure. The results clearly indicate that the common practice of deploying only one device per site and night very likely leads to several of the resident bat species being missed and produces unreliable activity estimates.",

It has been suggested that the flexibility of this species in regard to different human-induced changes, such as climate change and urbanization, is responsible for the apparent range shift. Although P. kuhlii exhibits one of the highest degrees of synanthropy among bat species in Europe, its ecology has thus far not been thoroughly studied. This study aims to describe its foraging and roosting selection in Central Europe (eastern Slovakia), where the northernmost maternity colony of P. kuhlii roosts in human settlements. Radio-tracking was conducted during the pre-parturition and post-lactation periods. We identified six artificial roosts within the study area that were interlinked, with bats switching between them. Ten individuals were used for modelling foraging-habitat utilization, which revealed that bats were highly selective. The only habitat type that bats clearly preferred, regardless of season, was an urban illuminated area close to a river. Only slight avoidance — of open areas — was observed during the pre-parturition period.",

Using acoustic data we tested the hypothesis that water availability restricts bat activity in the dry season to ponds, whereas in the rainy season resources are widely available and therefore used throughout the area. We compared bat activity at six ponds with that of a 500-meter transect perpendicular to each pond. We predicted that activity would be higher at ponds in the dry season, whereas in the rainy season activity should be equal or higher at transects. Also, all species guilds would use ponds in the dry season, whereas gleaners, edge aerial and open aerial foragers would be more frequent at transects in the rainy season. In no instance activity was higher at transects than at ponds during the rainy season. Open areas showed little or no bat activity in the dry season, but were very active in the rainy season. One transect located in dense forest and one near human dwellings were active both seasons. Open aerial foragers were present mostly on ponds in the dry season, and on ponds and transects in the rainy season; edge aerial bats were common in ponds in the dry season, but rare in transects in the rainy season. Trawling bats used ponds and transects in both seasons; and gleaners were rare over ponds and transects in both seasons. Because bats use the local habitat differently depending on season and feeding guild, and climate and seasonality vary greatly in Mexican temperate forests, conservation strategies can not be generalized, but should be implemented on a case-by-case basis.",

Cattle ranching, an important activity in these areas has resulted in construction of rainwater reservoirs that may represent the only available surface water during the dry season. Using acoustic detectors we measured activity in cattle ponds at La Michilía Biosphere Reserve, Durango, Mexico to assess patterns of use by insectivorous bats. We tested for differences in activity between ponds and seasons, and for relationships between bat activity and a set of environmental and pond variables. Bat activity was significantly higher at ponds in the dry season; ponds were used by aerial, trawling, and gleaning insectivores. In the rainy season gleaners did not use ponds, and the other guilds used them less frequently. Larger, older ponds with aquatic vegetation were used more frequently in the dry season, whereas maximum temperature and moon phase affected use in the rainy season. Cattle ponds are common in rangelands and forests of northern Mexico; they constitute important foraging and drinking resources in an area that harbors the largest populations of insectivorous bats in the world.",

            "abstractNote": "Freshwater systems have been profoundly changed by the construction of dams, and the influence of dams on bat activity is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of small dams along mountain streams on local bat communities. This work was carried out in five small streams located in the NE of Portugal using bioacoustic surveys during the summer of 2011. The present study confirms that, in the northeast areas of Portugal, the majority of bat species use artificial bodies of water for either drinking or foraging, but species differed in terms of their activity levels over the reservoirs when compared with intact stream habitats. As predicted, small dams in the study area were important centers of overall bat activity relative to other sampling areas. At the same time, feeding activity was also higher in the flooded areas. We also found that Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Myotis daubentonii, Pipistrellus kuhlii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus/Miniopterus schreibersii, Tadarida teniotis and Nyctalus leisleri/Eptesicus serotinus benefited from the presence of dam reservoirs. Hypsugo savii activity was also mostly recorded at reservoir points. However, the highest number of endangered and rare species was recorded at an intact stream habitat. This result emphasizes the relevance of riparian habitats for bats, especially for the most endangered species. The relationship between dam availability, riparian quality and bat diversity suggested that the changes in the streams promoted by damming could affect both bat species richness and activity levels, leading to changes in the overall composition of the bat community. In conclusion, this study found that small reservoirs have a significant influence on bat activity. However, dams appear to primarily benefit the most common species, while the endangered species were associated with riparian habitats. Therefore, for conservation proposes of the local bat community, riparian areas appear to be more important than reservoirs. Thus, this study provides a better understanding of the impact of small dams on bats contributing to the future management and conservation of bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "We investigated intra-annual variability in acarine parasite load (species richness, prevalence and abundance) and spleen mass in populations of leaf-nosed bats in highly seasonal tropical and subtropical climates: one population of California leaf-nosed bat (Macrotus californicus) in a subtropical thorn forest, one population of Waterhouse's leaf-nosed bat (M. waterhousii) in a subtropical desert, and one population of Waterhouse’s leaf-nosed bat in a tropical deciduous forest. We tested the hypothesis that hosts in highly seasonal tropical and subtropical climates exhibit significant seasonal changes in immune response and parasite load. Prevalence was 100% in most populations examined, except in the subtropical population of M. waterhousii in the rainy season. The tropical population had the highest parasite richness in both seasons and presented species belonging to the four acarine orders examined: Mesostigmata, Ixodidae, Trombidiformes, and Sarcoptiformes. Abundance values of Trombidiformes in M. californicus, and of Ixodida and Sarcoptiformes in the tropical M. waterhousii population were higher in the rainy than in the dry season. Spleen mass was larger in the tropical population in the rainy season and in the subtropical population in the dry season. Spleen mass was not related to abundance of any of the acarine orders (Mesostigmata, Ixodidae, Trombidiformes, and Sarcoptiformes) analyzed. Our findings suggest that bats in highly seasonal tropical and subtropical environments experience significant seasonal changes in parasite burden and in immune response.",

We used field-based observations and a playback experiment to investigate whether aircraft activity and noise alter the evening activity of New Zealand long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) — a cryptic threatened species. Low-altitude aircraft activity temporally overlapped bat activity near the runway of an international airport, but was unlikely to mask echolocation pulses as aircraft noise was most intense at ≤ 10 kHz. There was no statistically significant difference in mean bat activity during and after overflights compared with pre-aircraft activity. The experiment revealed that playback stimuli (aircraft passes and two controls: silent tracks and blackbird (Turdus merula) calls) differed in their effect on bat activity at two sites, one with low and one with high aircraft activity. Simulated aircraft noise and silent tracks reduced bat activity when compared with blackbird calls (P < 0.05). Bats may have found it easier to detect observers during the playback of silent tracks (sampling involved walking circuits with hand-held detectors), and may have reduced activity to a perceived threat. This result suggests that broadcasted aircraft noise is no more disturbing than researcher presence during playback trials. Evidence for a site × playback stimuli interaction (P = 0.054) suggests that bats at the site with high aircraft activity may have habituated to aircraft noise. Both correlative and experimental data suggests that aircraft activity and noise may not have major impacts on long-tailed bat activity.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the use of echolocation call structure to identify a number of bats in the families Vespertilionidae, Emballonuridae, Nycteridae and Megadermatidae from Thailand. These species typically emit echolocation calls with a frequency-modulated (FM) sweep dominating part or all of their calls. A total of 510 echolocation calls from free-flying individuals were recorded throughout Thailand. According to the frequency-time spectra, these calls were categorized into four types: broadband FM (eight species), narrowband FM (seven species), long multiharmonic (four species) and short multiharmonic (three species). Discriminant function analysis was used to classify calls from individual bats to species. Correct classification levels were 85.9% for individuals emitting broadband FM calls (six species with adequate sample sizes), 70.4% for narrowband FM bats (seven species), 84.4% for species emitting long multiharmonic calls (four species) and 96.7% for species emitting short multiharmonic calls (two species with adequate sample sizes). However, classification rates were often low at the species level. Acoustic identification of bats emitting FM calls should be approached with caution in species-rich communities, in contrast with the identification of rhinolophoid bats where many species use distinctive constant frequencies that can facilitate identification. and provides a basis for rapid acoustic surveys of large areas in Thailand, and potentially other parts of Southeast Asia.",

We hypothesised that if avian predation was the cause of clustering, bats in the prolonged absence of avian predators, would not cluster or would cluster less during their emergences. We studied the Azorean bat (Nyctalus azoreum) in the Azores Archipelago. The Azores have a depauperate fauna with no raptorial birds likely to predate bats. The Azorean bat is an endemic mammal to the archipelago, which has an unusually extensive degree of diurnal activity that has been hypothesised to reflect release from the risk of diurnal predation by raptors. Contrary to our prediction Azorean bats clustered during emergence to the same extent as bat species which occur where there are raptors. Two interpretations of these data are possible. First, the hypothesis that the behaviour is anti-predatory may be incorrect. Most of the variation in clustering was explained by variation in ambient temperature possibly suggesting the bats emerged in groups to aid exploitation of sparsely distributed food. Alternatively, the behaviour may be anti-predatory, but the key factor precipitating clustering may not be the risk from aerial predators, but terrestrial predators, such as rats (Rattus norvegicus) and cats (Felis cattus), both of which were common around the roost sites.",

Information on roost use enables us to understand the biological processes underlying bat ecology and is crucial with regard to the natural-roost loss and environmental pressures related to habitat destruction that has been considered as a threat affecting bat conservation. The aim of this study was to collect new data on the diurnal artificial-roost use by bats in a landscape from the southern Amazon. We observed bat species roosting at an abandoned house in a highly fragmented ecotone between the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. We observed one Trachops cirrhosus individual roosting in physical contact with one Phyllostomus hastatus. One year later, we noticed a compositional change at this roost, in which we found a large colony of Pteronotus parnellii. These findings may shed light on the potential flexibility of the roosting requirements of these species in such landscapes. Moreover, this is one of the first records of the use of human constructions by P. parnelli in such fragmented landscapes, a bat species that until recently was thought of as being associated only with well-preserved natural roosts.",

            "abstractNote": "A total of 39 species of small mammals (<1 kg) were documented during a biodiversity survey conducted from 9–24 March 2012 in a remote area of Southeastern Suriname. Taxonomic composition included 28 species of bats, 8 species of rats, and 3 species of opossums. The most common bat was the larger fruit-eating bat (Artibeus planirostris), which accounted for 38% of total captures. Although the capture rate for rats was substantially lower, as is typical of the Guiana Shield, spiny rats composed of 2 species (Proechimys spp.) were the commonest. For small opossums, there were 3 species documented by 1 individual each. Of the 3 sites sampled, the lowland sites were most similar with Upper Palumeu having the highest diversity of bats and Kasikasima having the highest abundance for bats. The highland site of Grensgebergte had the highest diversity and abundance for small non-volant mammals but the lowest for bats. This region of Southeastern Suriname has a mix of primary rainforest in a mosaic of lowland and highland habitats that supports diverse and different faunal communities of small mammals. The species composition was heterogeneous with no opossums shared among sites, whereas 25% of rats and just over 50% of bats were shared among sites. The most noteworthy records were the documentation of the poorly known water rat (Nectomys rattus) near the open granite outcrop of Grensgebergte.",

            "abstractNote": "The species number of rat, fruit bat, and insectivorous bat was significantly correlated with island size when five major islands of Irian, Borneo, Sumatra, Sulawesi and Java were included in the analysis, and the z area values were 0.22; 0.19 and, 0.26, respectively. When these islands were excluded, the correlation between species richness and island size was significant in fruit bats and insectivorous bats (R2=0.31, P<0.01) but not in rats. Z value declined to 0.07 in rats, 0.14 in fruit bats and 0.19 in insectivorous bats. Zoogeographic boundaries are shown. Wallace’s Line seems to be a zoogeographic boundary for all of three mammal groups; Bali and Lombok Islands belong to the cluster of Lesser Sunda in rats but not to the cluster of Greater Sunda in bats. Although Weber’s Line also seems to be a zoogeographic boundary for all of the three mammal groups, an effective boundary lies between Sulawesi and Maluku in rats and insectivorous bats but not between northern Maluku and Irian in fruit bats. The fauna of fruit bats in Southern Maluku is more similar to those of Irian. Lydekker’s line seems to be a boundary for only rats, though Biak, Owi and Yapen Islands belong to the cluster of Maluku. In addition to those boundaries, Cluster analyses revealed another boundary for rats between Sumatra and western Sumatra islands (Mentawai Islands) and between Lesser Sunda and Sulawesi to Southern Maluku for fruit and insectivorous bats.",

However, vouchered specimens demonstrate that Torres Strait records of the Large-eared flying-fox (Pteropus macrotis) actually reflect misidentifications of the Little Red flying-fox (P. scapulatus), and that the type series of Pteropus banakrisi Richards & Hall, 2002 (a newly-described species supposedly endemic to Moa Island) consists only of subadult individuals of the Black flying-fox (P. alecto). Only three flying-fox species are therefore known from the strait. These re-identifications underscore the importance of voucher specimens in biological investigations and have important implications for bat conservation in Australia. Pteropus macrotis is removed from the list of mammal species known from Australia, and banakrisi is placed in the synonymy of P. alecto.",

(mystacinus) przewalskii, Hypsugo savii and Nyctalus leisleri (cf. Fig. 1, 4-5). For these species the new records simplify the picture considerably as no complicated distribution pattern in the Near East needs to be assumed. For some species data on biometrics and biology are included.",

            "abstractNote": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses capable of infecting a wide range of hosts, including mammals and birds, and have caused significant epidemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Bats, the second most diverse mammalian order, are hosts for various CoVs due to their unique immune responses and ecological traits. This study investigates CoV prevalence in crevice- and tree-dwelling bats in Portugal, a country with limited prior research on bat CoVs. Using nested RT-PCR and sequencing, we screened 87 stool samples from bats, identifying one sample (1.15%) that was positive for Alphacoronavirus, belonging to Pipistrellus pipistrellus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close genetic relationships with Alphacoronavirus strains from the same bat species in Europe. The low prevalence suggests habitat-specific differences in viral transmission, with cave-dwelling bats exhibiting higher CoV prevalence due to population density and behaviour. These findings underscore the necessity for sustained surveillance efforts aimed at comprehending CoV dynamics within bat populations, especially concerning the risk of spillover events and viral evolution. Vital to this understanding is the monitoring of bat migration patterns, which serves as a crucial tool for elucidating CoV ecology and epidemiology. Such efforts are essential for ongoing research endeavours aimed at mitigating the potential for future zoonotic disease outbreaks.",

Bats have been identiﬁed as crucial reservoirs for CoVs, and they are found in various bat species worldwide. In this study, we investigated the presence of CoVs of four cavernicolous bats in six locations in the centre and south of Portugal. We collected faeces, anal, and buccal swab samples, as well as air samples from the locations using a Coriolis air sampler. Our results indicate that CoVs were more readily detected in faecal samples compared to anal and buccal swab samples. No CoVs were detected in the air samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the detected viruses belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus. This study represents the ﬁrst report of Alphacoronaviruses circulating in bats in Portugal and highlights the importance of continuous surveillance for novel CoVs in bat populations globally. Ongoing surveillance for CoVs in bat populations is essential as they are a vital source of these viruses. It is crucial to understand the ecological relationships between animals, humans, and the environment to prevent and control the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases. Further ecological studies are needed to investigate the factors contributing to the emergence and transmission of zoonotic viruses.",

We conducted a comprehensive field-based survey on bat ticks in Turkey and provided information about the phylogenetic placement of collected species. Sampling was carried out at 26 caves from 18 provinces around Turkey between 2019 and 2021. Eighty-one tick specimens collected from the cave environment or on various cave roosting bats resulted in five species: Ixodes vespertilionis, Ixodes simplex, Ixodes ariadnae, Ixodes kaiseri, and Haemaphysalis erinacei. While I. simplex was the most frequently collected species with a rate of 56.2% mainly from bats (Miniopterus schreibersii), I. vespertilionis was the most prevalent species (65.4%) and found mainly on cave walls. The first record of I. ariadnae was provided for Turkey. Phylogenetic trees were built using mt 16S rDNA and COI markers. Our results demonstrated the presence of two distinct lineages of I. vespertilionis in Turkey; one lineage grouped with European isolates, whereas three sequences clustered separately. The phylo­ genetic pattern of I. simplex was consistent with previous results; this clade was clustered distantly to other bat tick species. The significance of the surprising records of H. erinacei and I. kaiseri in caves is also discussed.",

From January to March, 2004 to 2006, we used radiotelemetry to investigate winter roost‐site selection by Seminole bats (\n              Lasiurus seminolus\n              ) on an intensively managed landscape with forested corridors in southeastern South Carolina, USA. We modeled roost‐site selection with logistic regression and used Akaike's Information Criterion for small samples (AIC\n              c\n              ) and Akaike weights to select models relating roost‐site selection to plot‐ and landscape‐level variables. We tracked 20 adult male bats to 71 individual roosts. Bats used a variety of roosting structures, including the canopy of overstory trees, understory vegetation, pine (\n              Pinus spp.\n              ) needle clusters, and leaf litter. Roost height, structure type, and habitat type were influenced by changes in minimum nightly temperature. On warmer nights, bats selected taller trees in mature forest stands, but when minimum nightly temperatures were <4° C, bats typically were found roosting on or near the forest floor in mid‐rotation stands. We recommend avoiding prescribed burning in mid‐rotation stands on days when the previous night's temperature is <4 °C to minimize potential disturbance and direct mortality of bats roosting on or near the forest floor. We encourage forest managers to incorporate seasonal changes in roost‐site selection to create year‐round management strategies for forest bats in managed landscapes.",

Additionally, more information is needed on bat ecology within such forest systems. Therefore, we examined summer roost‐site selection by evening bats (\n              Nycticeius humeralis\n              ) in an intensively managed landscape with forested corridors in southeastern South Carolina, USA, 2003–2006. We radiotracked 53 (26 M, 27 F) adult evening bats to 75 (31 M, 44 F) diurnal roosts. We modeled landscape‐level roost‐site selection with logistic regression and evaluated models using Akaike's Information Criterion for small samples. Model selection results indicated that mature (≥40 yr) mixed pine‐hardwood stands were important roost sites for male and lactating female evening bats. Upland forested corridors, comprised of mature pine or mixed pine‐hardwoods, were important roosting habitats for males and, to a lesser extent, lactating females. Male roosts were farther from open stands and lactating female roosts were farther from mid‐rotation stands than randomly selected structures. Our results suggest roost structures (i.e., large trees and snags) in mature forests are important habitat components for evening bats. We recommend maintaining older (>40 yr old) stand conditions in the form of forest stands or corridors across managed landscapes to provide roosting habitat. Furthermore, our results suggest that an understanding of sex‐specific roost‐site selection is critical for developing comprehensive guidelines for creating and maintaining habitat features beneficial to forest bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The winter roost-site selection of most North American foliage-roosting bats is relatively unknown. We examined winter roost-site selection of Seminole bats (Lasiurus seminolus) in the Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina during January 2004. Seminole bats used a variety of day-roost structures including the canopy of overstory hardwood trees, hanging vines, pine needle clusters suspended from understory vegetation, and leaf litter on the forest floor. Although reported for red bats (L. borealis), this is the first report of Seminole bats roosting in forest floor leaf litter. Winter roost selection differed from previous observations of summer roosts, which consisted almost exclusively of live overstory pine (Pinus spp.) trees. Roost-site selection in winter likely is related to ambient temperature and optimizing exposure to solar radiation during the day. Management decisions in southeastern forests should consider seasonal changes in roosting behavior to minimize adverse impacts on forest bats.",

Human screams, for example, are typically uttered in fearful contexts and they have a distinctive feature termed as “roughness”, which depicts amplitude fluctuations at rates from 30–150 Hz. In this article, we report that the occurrence of fast acoustic periodicities in harsh sounding vocalizations is not unique to humans. A roughness-like structure is also present in vocalizations emitted by bats (species\n              Carollia perspicillata\n              ) in distressful contexts. We report that 47.7% of distress calls produced by bats carry amplitude fluctuations at rates ~1.7 kHz (>10 times faster than temporal modulations found in human screams). In bats, rough-like vocalizations entrain brain potentials and are more effective in accelerating the bats’ heart rate than slow amplitude modulated sounds. Our results are consistent with a putative role of fast amplitude modulations (roughness in humans) for grabbing the listeners attention in situations in which the emitter is in distressful, potentially dangerous, contexts.",

Here we show that flapping fliers ranging in size from fruit flies to large birds benefit from substantial damping of angular velocity through a passive mechanism termed flapping counter-torque (FCT). Our FCT model predicts that isometrically scaled animals experience similar damping on a per-wingbeat time scale, resulting in similar turning dynamics in wingbeat time regardless of body size. The model also shows how animals may simultaneously specialize in both maneuverability and stability (at the cost of efficiency) and provides a framework for linking morphology, wing kinematics, maneuverability, and flight dynamics across a wide range of flying animals spanning insects, bats, and birds.",

Despite their ecological significance, locating bat roosts remains a challenging task for ecologists. Traditional field surveys are time-consuming, expensive and may disturb sensitive bat populations. In this article, we combine data from static audio detectors with a bat movement model to facilitate the detection of bat roosts. Crucially, our technique not only provides a point prediction for the most likely location of a bat roost, but because of the algorithm’s speed, it can be applied over an entire landscape, resulting in a likelihood map, which provides optimal searching regions. To illustrate the success of the algorithm and highlight limitations, we apply our technique to greater horseshoe bat (\n              Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\n              ) acoustic data acquired from six surveys from four different UK locations and over six different times in the year. Furthermore, we investigate what happens to the accuracy of our predictions in the case that the roost is not contained within the area spanned by the detectors. This innovative approach to searching rural environments holds the potential to greatly reduce the labour required for roost finding, and, hence, enhance the conservation efforts of bat populations and their habitats.",

Samples of bats were obtained from the Philippines over 5 years, and reproductive tracts were preserved and examined using standard histological techniques. Most parous female pygmy bats were impregnated in June, within a few weeks of parturition, and the embryos underwent superficial implantation at the anterior end of the uterus contralateral to the previously gravid uterus. Shortly thereafter, the rate of embryonic growth slowed tremendously for up to 8 months. During the period of delay, the mean length of the embryoblast increased only from 280 11mto 520 11m.In March of the following year, the developmental rate increased, and the embryos completed development in the next 3 months. The 8-month delay gives these bats a gestation period of 11·5 months, the longest known in bats. Most nulliparous females become pregnant at an age of 3-5 months, and their embryos entered a similar delay that terminated in March or April, after 2-6 months of delay. Males showed signs of fertility throughout the entire year, but testis volume was highest during May, June and July, at about the time when most females become receptive.",

            "abstractNote": "We undertook a survey of mammal diversity and indigenous knowledge of mammals in Hewa country, in the vicinity of Wanakipa village, Southern Highlands Province, during July 2008. Specimens collected during this survey document the occurrence of 22 mammal species in the immediate area, including one monotreme, 6 marsupials, 7 rodents, and 8 bats. Two species of conservation concern, the Eastern Long-Beaked Echidna Zaglossus bartoni (IUCN Critically Endangered) and Goodfellow’s Tree Kangaroo Dendrolagus goodfellowi (IUCN Endangered) were documented by trophy skulls and bones kept by Hewa hunters. Three mammals are apparently reported from Southern Highlands Province for the first time: the bent-wing bat Miniopterus macrocneme, the long-eared bat Nyctophilus microtis, and a rodent species in the Rattus rattus species complex. The presence of this last species, an invasive rodent trapped distant from an immediate village commensal context, provides an interesting indication of recent environmental change in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Hewa informants convincingly communicated their familiarity with more than 20 additional mammal species, including those restricted to higher elevations than we visited during our survey, including one of special conservation concern, the tree kangaroo Dendrolagus [dorianus] notatus (IUCN Endangered). Hewa folk taxonomy suggests that three tree kangaroo species may occur in the region, one of which may be the Lowland Tree Kangaroo (Dendrolagus spadix) or even a currently undocumented population or unrecognized species. The mammal fauna of Wanakipa appears similar in composition to better surveyed areas of similar elevation situated along the southern margin of the central cordillera in Southern Highlands Province, such as Mt. Sisa and Mt. Bosavi.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are associated with the circulation of most mammalian filoviruses (FiVs), with pathogenic ones frequently causing deadly hemorrhagic fevers in Africa. Divergent FiVs have been uncovered in Chinese bats, raising concerns about their threat to public health. Here, we describe a long-term surveillance to track bat FiVs at orchards, eventually resulting in the identification and isolation of a FiV, Dehong virus (DEHV), from\n              Rousettus leschenaultii\n              bats. DEHV has a typical filovirus-like morphology with a wide spectrum of cell tropism. Its entry into cells depends on the engagement of Niemann-Pick C1, and its replication is inhibited by remdesivir. DEHV has the largest genome size of filoviruses, with phylogenetic analysis placing it between the genera\n              Dianlovirus\n              and\n              Orthomarburgvirus\n              , suggesting its classification as the prototype of a new genus within the family\n              Filoviridae\n              . The continuous detection of viral RNA in the serological survey, together with the wide host distribution, has revealed that the region covering southern Yunnan, China, and bordering areas is a natural circulation sphere for bat FiVs. These emphasize the need for a better understanding of the pathogenicity and potential risk of FiVs in the region.",

            "abstractNote": "Perception and encoding of object size is an important feature of sensory systems. In the visual system object size is encoded by the visual angle (visual aperture) on the retina, but the aperture depends on the distance of the object. As object distance is not unambiguously encoded in the visual system, higher computational mechanisms are needed. This phenomenon is termed ‘‘size constancy’’. It is assumed to reflect an automatic re-scaling of visual aperture with perceived object distance. Recently, it was found that in echolocating bats, the ‘sonar aperture’, i.e., the range of angles from which sound is reflected from an object back to the bat, is unambiguously perceived and neurally encoded. Moreover, it is well known that object distance is accurately perceived and explicitly encoded in bat sonar. Here, we addressed size constancy in bat biosonar, recruiting virtual-object techniques. Bats of the species Phyllostomus discolor learned to discriminate two simple virtual objects that only differed in sonar aperture. Upon successful discrimination, test trials were randomly interspersed using virtual objects that differed in both aperture and distance. It was tested whether the bats spontaneously assigned absolute width information to these objects by combining distance and aperture. The results showed that while the isolated perceptual cues encoding object width, aperture, and distance were all perceptually well resolved by the bats, the animals did not assign absolute width information to the test objects. This lack of sonar size constancy may result from the bats relying on different modalities to extract size information at different distances. Alternatively, it is conceivable that familiarity with a behaviorally relevant, conspicuous object is required for sonar size constancy, as it has been argued for visual size constancy. Based on the current data, it appears that size constancy is not necessarily an essential feature of sonar perception in bats.",

In particular, spatial working memory (SWM), i.e. the ability of animals to store temporarily useful information for current foraging tasks, determines the foraging efficiency of individuals. As a consequence, SWM also has the potential to influence competitive abilities and to affect patterns of sympatric occurrence among closely related species. The present study aims at comparing the efficiency of SWM between generalist (Glossophaga soricina) and specialist (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) nectarivorous bats at flowering patches. The two species differ in diet – the generalist diet including seasonally fruits and insects with nectar and pollen while the specialist diet is dominated by nectar and pollen yearlong – and in some morphological traits – the specialist being heavier and with proportionally longer rostrum than the generalist. These bats are found sympatrically within part of their range in the Neotropics. We habituated captive individuals to feed on artificial flower patches and we used infrared video recordings to monitor their ability to remember and avoid the spatial location of flowers they emptied in previous visits in the course of 15-min foraging sequences. Experiments revealed that both species rely on SWM as their foraging success attained significantly greater values than random expectations. However, the nectar specialist L. yerbabuenae was significantly more efficient at extracting nectar (+28% in foraging success), and sustained longer foraging bouts (+27% in length of efficient foraging sequences) than the generalist G. soricina. These contrasting SWM performances are discussed in relation to diet specialization and other life history traits.",

            "abstractNote": "Parameterization of bats' echolocation signal is essentially based on determination of spectral power density by means of the classic Fourier transform FFT. This study presents an alternative solution in this area of research, that is parametric and nonparametric modelling of short-time signals. The above mentioned methods are based on modelling of white noise with the use of digital filters the transmission of which was set in a way that allows the output signal to be as close to the modelled signal as possible. Proper selection of parameterization method — MA (Moving Average), AR (Autoregressive), ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average), in respect of the character of signal spectrum (line spectrum, noise) maximally reduces the number of filter coefficients and improves the accuracy of bat's signal modelling. The work also presents the possibility of using the suggested parameterization methods in automatic species identification.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions are a major threat to global biodiversity with particularly deleterious consequences on oceanic islands. The introduction of large terrestrial animals – generally absent on islands – can disrupt important ecosystem functions, such as the dispersal of native seeds. However, while the consequences of plant invasions received much attention, the potential of introduced animals to change insular seed dispersal networks remains largely unknown. Here, we collated evidence from five sampling methods to assemble qualitative and quantitative, multi‐guild seed dispersal network for the island of São Tomé (Gulf of Guinea) and explore whether native and introduced seed dispersers consistently differ in their topological roles, in their gape width and in the size of the dispersed seeds. Our network included 428 interactions between 23 dispersers (14 birds, 2 bats, 1 snake and 6 non‐flying mammals) and 133 plant species. Each method (direct observations, identification of seeds in droppings and stomachs, questionnaires and literature review) was particularly informative for a small group of dispersers, thus rendering largely complementary information. Native and introduced dispersers did not differ in their topological position in either qualitative or quantitative networks (linkage level, specialization d' and species strength). However, introduced dispersers tend to have much larger gape widths and to disperse significantly larger seeds. Our results point to a general upsizing of the seed dispersal network in the island of São Tomé driven by the recent arrival of large, introduced animals. We argue that this pattern is likely common on other oceanic islands where introduced dispersers might counteract the general pattern of seed dispersal downsizing resulting from the selective extinction of larger animals.",

            "abstractNote": "In the Constant Frequency portions of the orientation calls of various Rhinolophus and Hipposideros species, the frequency with the strongest amplitude was studied comparatively. (1) In the five European species of the genus Rhinolophus call frequencies are either species-specific (R.ferrumequinum, R. blasii and R. euryale) or they overlap (R. hipposideros and R. mehelyi). The call frequency distributions are approximately 5-9 kHz wide, thus their ranges spread less than ± 5% from the mean (Fig. 1). Frequency distributions are considerably narrower within smaller geographic areas. (2) As in other bat groups, call frequencies of the Rhinolophoidea are negatively correlated with body size (Fig. 3). Regression lines for the genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros are distinctly different. (3) Within the genus Rhinolophus, species from dryer climates have on the average higher call frequencies than species from tropical rain forests. (4) The Krau Game Reserve, a still largely intact rain forest area in Malaysia, harbours at least 12 syntopic Rhinolophus and Hipposideros species. Their call frequencies lie between 40 and 200 kHz (Fig. 2). Distribution over the available frequency range is significantly more even than could be expected from chance alone. Two different null hypotheses to test for random character distribution were derived from frequency-size-re1ations and by sampling species assemblages from a species pool (Monte Carlo method); both were rejected. In particular, call frequencies lying close together are avoided (Figs. 4, 5). Conversely, the distribution of size ratios complied with a corresponding null hypothesis. This even distribution may be a consequence of resource partitioning with respect to prey type. Alternatively, the importance of these calls as social signals (e.g. recognition of con specifics) might have necessitated a communication channel partitioning.",

We addressed this information gap by compiling records from museums and published documents, and surveying for bats with traps and ultrasonic detectors during the summers of 2004 and 2005. Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown Bat) and M. septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) were the most abundant and widespread species of bats on the island. These species form maternity colonies, but the potential for there to be large natural hibernacula on the island is considered low. Lasiurus cinereus (Hoary Bat) is the only other species of bat that has been recorded on PEI, but its occurrence is rare. Diversity and abundance of bats on PEI may be limited by its northern insular geography, patchy distribution of forested areas, and lack of hibernacula. These limitations make protecting such resources on PEI and in neighboring provinces important for conserving the region’s bat fauna.",
