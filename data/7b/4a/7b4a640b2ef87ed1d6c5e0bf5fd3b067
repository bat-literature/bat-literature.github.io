The goal of our study was to better understand the drivers of bat activity in agricultural landscapes to inform conservation policy and make specific recommendations for habitat management. We placed sixty-four full spectrum bat detectors at random recording locations, weekly, along field boundaries in North Somerset between July and October 2020. We used an automated classifier to analyse recordings and performed error rate modelling to account for and remove the majority of error in automated classifications. We used generalised additive models to explore bat response to recording location metrics, controlling for spatialautocorrelation and temporal differences in sampling. We validated our models with k-fold cross-validation and explored the utility of our models for predicting bat activity at new sites. We found that field boundary characteristics better describe bat activity than adjacent field characteristics or measures of local landscape for the majority of species studied. Bat activity was higher along tall, wide, vegetated field boundaries containing trees; there was lower activity at arable recording locations. Still, bat activity was highly variable and predictive error was high. We found a large spatial effect driving activity patterns, meaning models are not able to predict activity beyond the extent of the study area. We recommend management strategies that give incentives to farmers for replacing fences with hedgerows, planting hedgerow trees, and maintaining tall and outgrown field boundaries.",

To assess, select and monitor these habitat trees, ecologists and practitioners often use Tree-related Microhabitats (TreMs), which are assumed to represent the abundance and diversity of environmental resources for a wide range of forest-dwelling taxa. However, the relationship between TreMs and forest organisms is not fully un­ derstood. In this context, we attempted to identify and quantify the links between TreMs and three groups of forest organisms: insects, bats, and birds. Specifically, we tested whether species abundance is influenced by TreM abundance, either as direct predictor or as mediator of environmental predictors.",

This study provides data on mammal assemblage and assessment on the added value of the ca. 2.99 km2 MHRWS expansion sites to the already protected zone. Faunistic inventory and assessment documented 19 species of mammals belonging to 16 genera, eight families and five orders. This adds nine species to the previously reported mammals of Mt. Hamiguitan range making it a home to 30 species. Relatively low diversity of mammals (H’=0.615) in the expansion sites is attributed to poor soil resulting to low forest productivity and habitat loss due to mining, logging and shifting cultivation. This unique assemblage of vulnerable and endemic species of bats and mammals in Mt. Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary expansion sites calls for more sampling effort and conservation strategies to maintain its bat and mammal assemblage.",

            "abstractNote": "Metal-contaminated soils and sediments are widespread in urbanized areas due to atmospheric deposition close to emission sources. These metals are bio-available for organisms, e.g., insects, and accumulate in food chains of insectivorous mammals. Especially bats, which live in urban regions and ingest large amounts of food relative to their body mass, are at risk of being poisoned due to the accumulation of trace metals. To determine species-specific trace metal contents in bats from urban environments, hair samples were analyzed by ICP-OES. Observed trace metal concentrations were related to species-specific foraging habitat, prey spectrum and degree of synanthropy. The species studied were Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Myotis daubentonii and Nyctalus noctula. P. pipistrellus showed the highest concentrations of lead and zinc and slightly higher concentrations of cadmium than the other two species, which was related to its high degree of synanthropy with foraging habitat mostly located in cities. In contrast, N. noctula displayed the highest contents of manganese and copper. The reason might be found in its prey spectrum, as N. noctula feeds mainly on beetles that are caught in cultured areas. Trace metal concentrations determined in hair samples of M. daubentonii ranged between the values of P. pipistrellus and N. noctula, probably reflecting an intermediate level of synanthropy. Positive correlations were observed between the concentrations of cadmium and lead and those of manganese and copper. Hair samples from bats are suitable monitoring tools to study trace metal exposure and can be used to determine differences in trace metal levels between species.",

This information is supplemented by new data from more recent field-based ethnobiological research in Nage and other parts of Flores, and is analyzed comparatively with reference to ideas about Chiropterans from other parts of the world. The way Nage and other Flores Islanders treat bats may appear cross-culturally unusual, but their ideas are shown to fit within a range of ways humans think about these remarkable creatures. In a more general vein, attention is given to the widely recognized morphological and behavioral ambiguity of bats and the variable extent to which this ambiguity affects their representation—both in folk zoological classification (or ethnotaxonomy) and symbolic thought (including taboo, spiritual belief, myth, and metaphor). A comparative analysis also demonstrates how, by contrast to the stereotypical view of bats as embodiments of evil in European thought, both Westerners and non-Westerners can represent bats positively, and that even where a generally negative view prevails, bats can possess a positive value contextually.",

Cambodia represents an important case study for studying humanbat interactions, as loss of karst caves and the destruction of forests threaten the stability of bat populations and the ecosystem services they provide. Cambodians rely on bats for tourism revenue, fertilizer from guano, and as a source of protein. However, there is a lack of information on people’s attitudes towards and relationships with cave-roosting bats. In 2018, we interviewed 60 residents around three karst outcrops (Sampeau Hill, Banan Hill, and Reichiatra Hill) in Battambang Province, northwestern Cambodia, along with agricultural professionals in Battambang Town, the province’s capital. The primary objectives of the interviews were to examine people’s (1) attitudes towards bats, (2) experiences with bats, and (3) engagement in high-risk behaviors associated with transmission of bat-related diseases (e.g., guano mining, hunting, etc.). Most respondents (70%) held positive attitudes towards bats and listed guano production, pest control, and tourism as benefits bats provide. Additionally, all informants believed bats should be protected and stated that they would feel sad if bats were extirpated. Conversely, respondents noted that many people eat bats. We followed these semi-structured interviews with five key informant interviews involved with the conservation of bats, which provided information on the history of human-bat interactions within these communities. Respondents’ positive attitudes towards bats and recognition of ecosystem services bats provide indicate they would support bat conservation policy and may be interested in developing communitybased conservation programs around karst outcrops.",

            "abstractNote": "Background:  Fruit bats play an important role in pollination and seed dispersal, and their conservation is important to maintain the productivity of some crops and natural ecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and perception of fruit bats by orchard farmers and agricultural communities in Pakistan.\nMethods:  The present survey was conducted in two districts (i.e. Sheikhupura and Malakand districts) within Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces based on the higher number of fruit growing areas and bat roosting sites. A total of 200 (100 per district) close-ended questionnaires with 53 questions were administered to randomly selected respondents within the selected communities associated with fruit orchards, including orchard owners, laborers, and members of the surrounding community. Each questionnaire was divided into seven sections (i.e., demographic information, environmental and public health effects of bats, knowledge about bats, perception and control of bats, non-lethal methods adopted to control bats, and different myths about bats).\nResults:  A majority of respondents (59%, n = 118) mis-classified bats as birds instead of mammals despite more than 84% reporting that they have observed bats. Nearly 71.5% of orchard farmers perceived that their fruits are contaminated by bats during consumption, and a majority believe that bats destroy orchards (62.5%) and are responsible for spreading disease. Mythology about bats was ambiguous, as 49% of those surveyed did not perceived bats to bring good luck (49%), and 50% did not perceived them to be bad omens either. Most respondents have never killed a bat (68%) nor would they kill a bat if given the opportunity (95%). Regarding the control of bats, the greatest percentage of respondents strongly disagree with shooting bats (36%) and strongly agree with leaving bats alone (42.5%).\nConclusions:  This study provides a better understanding of the sociodemographic factors associated with knowledge, attitude and perception of bats from fruit orchard owners, labourers and local people. We recommend educational interventions for targeted groups in the community, highlighting the ecosystem services and importance of bat conservation to improve people’s current knowledge regarding the role of bats and reduce direct persecution against bats.",

During winter, the absence of dietary substrates in fat storing hibernators leads to a reduction in the mass of fats and digestive organs. We examined the seasonal changes in body mass and activity of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and small intestine of the torpid Eptesicus nilssonii (Keyserling & Blasius, 1839). Adult females and males were captured in autumn (November, early hibernation), winter (February, mid hibernation) and spring (March–April, late hibernation) in northwestern Russia (Republic of Karelia). Our findings indicated that male and female E. nilssonii reduced body mass during hibernation, but females exhibited a slower decline in body mass during hibernation period than males. No significant differences in the activity of digestive enzymes were found between males and females. Pancreatic protease activity was the highest in autumn, decreased in the mid hibernation season, and remained low during hibernation of E. nilssonii. There was no difference in the activity of amylase and lipase in the pancreas among all periods of hibernation. However, the activity of protease, amylase and lipase in small intestine was higher before the emergence from hibernation in spring than during autumn. This study provides new information of the maintenance of intestinal hydrolytic enzyme activity after months of fasting. E. nilssonii, a fat storing hibernator, appears to maintain a digestive function during the hibernation season, apparently to allow efficient absorption of nutrients that are ingested after terminal arousal in the spring.",

The basic role of respiration, in gas exchange and in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis under exercise stress, must be achieved in a way that is compatible not only with the rhythmic contraction of powerful flightmuscles but also with the continual production of high-intensity vocalizations necessary for acoustic orientation. Moreover, the demand for accurate navigational information is often greatest during the stresses of rapid erratic flight. At such times bats continually emit brief, high-intensity orientation sounds at repetition rates varying from a few to many per second. Nothing is known regarding the relationship between respiration, sound production and wing movements during flight, or the extent to which changes in pulse-repetition rate affects respiration.",

The mean body weight (W) ranged from 5 g in Pipistrellus pipistrellus to 173g in Cheiromeles torquatus; the lung volume (VL) ranged from 0·3 cm3 in Pipistrellus to 10 cm3 in Cheiromeles. The volume densities or the main components of the bat lung, namely the parenchyma [Vv(p,L)] (the gas exchange region) and the nonparenchyma [Vv(np,L)], were closely similar, the Vv(p,L) constituting a mean value of 84·2% and the Vv(np,L) 15·8% in the five species. The VL, the surface area of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier (St), the pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc), and the total morphometric pulmonary diffusing capacity were all strongly correlated with body weight. The harmonic mean thickness of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier (τht) and the surface density of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier [Sv(t,p)] were poorly correlated with W. The bats had a remarkably higher VL than either birds or terrestrial mammals. The Vc in the bat lung was similar to that in the bird lung but higher than that of the terrestrial mammals. The bats had a more extensive St than either the birds or the terrestrial mammals. In the bats the τht was thicker than in the birds but thinner than that of the terrestrial mammals. These pulmonary structural adaptations culminated in a higher in the bat than either in the birds or in the terrestrial mammals. The superior morphometric properties of the bat lung coupled with the established physiological adaptations may help to explain how the bat lung is capable of providing the immense amount of oxygen demanded by flight.",

All species showed similar call intensities of between 80 and 90 dB peSPL (peak equivalent SPL) at 1 m during ﬂight except Plecotus auritus, whose call intensity was between 68 and 77 dB peSPL at 1 m. Calls from stationary bats were about 13 dB less intense than calls during ﬂight. A method is proposed to measure the root mean square (rms) amplitude of echolocation calls and, hence, to calculate the energy ﬂux density of the call. The constant-frequency calls of Rhinolophus hipposideros have energy ﬂux densities approximately ten times higher than those of bats using frequency-modulated calls as a result of their longer durations and lower crest factors. It is argued that the low-intensity calls of P. auritus allow it to approach tympanate moths more closely before triggering their escape response.",

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT\n            The extents of functional surfaces (villi, microvilli) have been estimated at different longitudinal sites, and in the entire small intestine, for three species of bats belonging to two feeding groups: insect- and fruit-eaters. In all species, surface areas and other structural quantities tended to be greatest at more cranial sites and to decline caudally. The entomophagous bat (Miniopterus inflatus) had a mean body mass (coefficient of variation) of 8.9 g (5 %) and a mean intestinal length of 20 cm (6 %). The surface area of the basic intestinal tube (primary mucosa) was 9.1 cm2 (10 %) but this was amplified to 48 cm2 (13 %) by villi and to 0.13 m2 (20 %) by microvilli. The total number of microvilli per intestine was 4×1011 (20 %). The average microvillus had a diameter of 89 nm (10 %), a length of 1.1 μm (22 %) and a membrane surface area of 0.32 μm2 (31 %). In two species of fruit bats (Epomophorus wahlbergi and Lisonycteris angolensis), body masses were greater and intestines longer, the values being 76.0 g (18 %) and 76.9 g (4 %), and 73 cm (16 %) and 72 cm (7 %), respectively. Surface areas were also greater, amounting to 76 cm2 (26 %) and 45 cm2 (8 %) for the primary mucosa, 547 cm2 (29 %) and 314 cm2 (16 %) for villi and 2.7 m2 (23 %) and 1.5 m2 (18 %) for microvilli. An increase in the number of microvilli, 33×1011 (19 %) and 15×1011 (24 %) per intestine, contributed to the more extensive surface area but there were concomitant changes in the dimensions of microvilli. Mean diameters were 94 nm (8 %) and 111 nm (4 %), and mean lengths were 2.8 μm (12 %) and 2.9 μm (10 %), respectively. Thus, an increase in the surface area of the average microvillus to 0.83 μm2 (12 %) and 1.02 μm2 (11 %) also contributed to the greater total surface area of microvilli. The lifestyle-related differences in total microvillous surface areas persisted when structural quantities were normalised for the differences in body masses. The values for total microvillous surface area were 148 cm2 g−1 (20 %) in the entomophagous bat, 355 cm2 g−1 (20 %) in E. wahlbergi and 192 cm2 g−1 (17 %) in L. angolensis. This was true despite the fact that the insect-eater possessed a greater length of intestine per unit of body mass: 22 mm g−1 (8 %) versus 9–10 mm g−1 (9–10 %) for the fruit-eaters.",

            "abstractNote": "Stable isotopes of carbon are commonly used to characterize dietary preferences in animals. Because turnover rates of carbon isotopes are related to metabolic rate, we wanted to determine the rates at which carbon isotopes are exchanged in tissues of two species of nectarfeeding bats (Leptonycteris curasoae and Glossophaga soricina), both of which have relatively high mass-speciﬁc metabolic rates. To test the hypothesis that isotope turnover is higher in nectar-feeding bats, because of their high mass-speciﬁc metabolic rates, than in other eutherian mammals, we conducted diet-switching experiments and chose three target tissues (hair, wing membrane and blood) to evaluate the isotopic turnover rates. We made the following predictions: (1) isotopic composition should change towards higher δ13C-values due to the turnover of carbon isotopes of C3 origin with those of C4/CAM origin; (2) the turnover rates of carbon isotopes would differ between the three types of tissues in the following order of decreasing turnover rates: blood>wing membrane>hair; and (3) turnover rates of nectar-feeding bats should exceed those reported for other small mammals because of the high mass-speciﬁc metabolic rate of nectar-feeding bats. Compared to the initial diet, target tissues were enriched in heavy carbon isotopes by 2.8‰ in L. curasoae and by 2.6‰ in G. soricina. After changing the diet from C3 to C4/CAM origin we found an increase in abundance of 13C in blood and wing membrane in all experimental subjects. The estimated half life of carbon isotope turnover ranged from 100 to 134 days and did not differ signiﬁcantly between blood and wing membrane, nor did it differ between the two species. The low turnover rate in wing membrane may reﬂect its speciﬁc composition and the relatively low temperature of this tissue, and long-lived erythrocytes in bat blood may be responsible for the low turnover rate of carbon isotopes in blood. The turnover rate of stable carbon isotopes in hair was low in L. curasoae and undetectable in G. soricina, which may be explained by the seasonal growth of the hair in these two species. Because both species are small (10 and 25·g, respectively) and nectar-feeding bats have higher massspeciﬁc metabolic rates than bats in temperate regions or similar sized terrestrial mammals, our ﬁndings of low turnover rates were unexpected.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary We investigated the echolocating bat’s use of an acoustic landmark for orientation in a complex environment with no visual information. Three bats of the species Eptesicus fuscus were trained to ﬂy through a hole in a mist net to receive a food reward on the other side. In all experiments, the vocal behavior of the bats was recorded simultaneously using a high-speed video recording system, allowing for a 3D reconstruction of the ﬂight path. We ran three types of experiments, with different spatial relations between the landmark and net hole. In the ﬁrst experiment, the bat’s behavior was studied in test trials with the landmark placed 10·cm to the left of the net opening; between test trials, the positions of the net opening and landmark were moved, but the spatial relationship between the two remained ﬁxed. With the landmark adjacent to the net opening, the bats quickly found the hole. In the second experiment, bats were tested in control trials in which the landmark was moved independently of the hole, breaking the established spatial relationship between the two. In control trials the bats repeatedly crashed into the net next to the landmark, and inspected the area around it. In the ﬁnal experiment, the landmark was removed altogether from the set-up. Here the bats spent more time per trial searching for the net opening with an increased number of inspections as well as crashes into the net. However, over the course of a test day without the landmark, bats reduced the time spent per trial and focused inspections and crashes around the hole. The behavioral data show for the ﬁrst time that the echolocating bat can learn to rely on an acoustic landmark to guide spatial orientation.",

However, δ13Cbreath is sensitive to changes in ingested food items and the mixed combustion of exogenous and endogenous substrates. Therefore, experiments under controlled conditions are pivotal for the correct interpretation of δ13Cbreath of free-ranging animals. We measured δ13Cbreath in fasted and recently fed insectivorous Myotis myotis (Chiroptera) to assess the residence time of carbon isotopes in the pool of metabolized substrate, and whether δ13Cbreath in satiated individuals levels off at values similar to the dietary isotope signature (δ13Cdiet) in insect-feeding mammals. Mean δ13Cbreath of fasted individuals was depleted by –5.8‰ (N=6) in relation to δ13Cdiet. After feeding on insects, bats exchanged 50% of carbon atoms in the pool of metabolized substrates within 21.6±10.5 min, which was slower than bats ingesting simple carbohydrates. After 2 h, δ13Cbreath of satiated bats levelled off at –2.6‰ below δ13Cdiet, suggesting that bats combusted both exogenous and endogenous substrate at this time. A literature survey revealed that small birds and mammals metabolize complex macronutrients at slower rates than simple macronutrients. On average, δ13Cbreath of fasting birds and mammals was depleted in 13C by –3.2±2.0‰ in relation to δ13Cdiet. δ13Cbreath of satiated animals differed by –0.6±2.3‰ from δ13Cdiet when endogenous substrates were not in isotopic equilibrium with exogenous substrates and by +0.5±1.8‰ (N=6 species) after endogenous substrates were in isotopic equilibrium with exogenous substrates.",

            "abstractNote": "Previous studies reported that fed bats and birds mostly use recently acquired exogenous nutrients as fuel for flight, rather than endogenous fuels, such as lipids or glycogen. However, this pattern of fuel use may be a simple size-related phenomenon because, to date, only small birds and bats have been studied with respect to the origin of metabolized fuel, and because small animals carry relatively small energy reserves, considering their high mass-specific metabolic rate. We hypothesized that ~150g Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus Pteropodidae), which are more than an order of magnitude heavier than previously studied bats, also catabolize dietary sugars directly and exclusively to fuel both rest and flight metabolism. We based our expectation on the observation that these animals rapidly transport ingested dietary sugars, which are absorbed via passive paracellular pathways in the intestine, to organs of high energy demand. We used the stable carbon isotope ratio in exhaled CO2 (13Cbreath) to assess the origin of metabolized substrates in 16 Egyptian fruit bats that were maintained on a diet of C3 plants before experiments. First, we predicted that in resting bats 13Cbreath remains constant when bats ingest C3 sucrose, but increases and converges on the dietary isotopic signature when C4 sucrose and C4 glucose are ingested. Second, if flying fruit bats use exogenous nutrients exclusively to fuel flight, we predicted that 13Cbreath of flying bats would converge on the isotopic signature of the C4 sucrose they were fed. Both resting and flying Egyptian fruit bats, indeed, directly fuelled their metabolism with freshly ingested exogenous substrates. The rate at which the fruit bats oxidized dietary sugars was as fast as in 10g nectar-feeding bats and 5g hummingbirds. Our results support the notion that flying bats, irrespective of their size, catabolize dietary sugars directly, and possibly exclusively, to fuel flight.",

In this study we analyzed the three-dimensional flight paths and echolocation behavior of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) attacking B. trigona in a flight room over seven consecutive nights to determine the acoustic mechanism of the sonar-jamming defense. Three mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the phantom echo hypothesis, which states that bats misinterpret moth clicks as echoes; (2) the ranging interference hypothesis, which states that moth clicks degrade the bats’ precision in determining target distance; and (3) the masking hypothesis, which states that moth clicks mask the moth echoes entirely, making the moth temporarily invisible. On nights one and two of the experiment, the bats appeared startled by the clicks; however, on nights three through seven, the bats frequently missed their prey by a distance predicted by the ranging interference hypothesis (~15–20cm). Three-dimensional simulations show that bats did not avoid phantom targets, and the bats’ ability to track clicking prey contradicts the predictions of the masking hypothesis. The moth clicks also forced the bats to reverse their stereotyped pattern of echolocation emissions during attack, even while bats continued pursuit of the moths. This likely further hinders the bats’ ability to track prey. These results have implications for the evolution of sonar jamming in tiger moths, and we suggest evolutionary pathways by which sonar jamming may have evolved from other tiger moth defense mechanisms.",

All study bats jumped using a similar technique, with the wing musculature providing the force. The bats jumped off the wrist joint of their wings, typically with their feet already off the ground. Contrary to expectations, jump performance did not correlate with ecology and was instead strongly determined by body size. In general, the larger bats produced more jump force, left the ground at higher speeds and jumped higher than the smaller bats. The differences in force production disappeared when the data were corrected for body size, with the exception of Myotis capaccinii, which produced significantly less force. Scaling of jump performance with body size measured here was compared against two existing muscle performance scaling models. The model suggesting that muscle contraction velocity is proportional to muscle length was better supported than that based on muscle cross-sectional area. Both models, however, failed to accurately predict the scaling of jump forces, with the slope of the relationship being significantly steeper than predicted, highlighting the need for further investigations of vertebrate muscle performance scaling. The results of this study indicate that a bat’s jumping ability is a secondary locomotor ability that uses the strongly selected-for flight apparatus with no apparent ecological trend present, i.e. flight so dominates bat locomotor morphology that other locomotor abilities tend to be derivative.",

We measured the effect that diet quality and Ta had on the use of torpor by the nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae. Captive bats were fed with 5% (low) or 35% (high) sucrose solutions while exposed to two different Ta (17.7 and 23.2°C; low Ta and high Ta) in four different treatments: (1) high sucrose:high Ta, (2) high sucrose:low Ta, (3) low sucrose:high Ta and (4) low sucrose:low Ta. We measured their energy intake, changes in body mass (ΔMb) and skin temperature (Tskin) as response variables. Energy intake (in 10 h) was limited when both species fed on 5% sucrose, but body mass gain was only affected in G. soricina. Energy intake and Ta had a negative effect on the minimum Tskin of both species, and ΔMb affected the time that G. soricina used torpor. Both species remained normothermic on the high sucrose:high Ta treatment, but used torpor on the other three treatments. Bats used torpor during their resting and activity periods. Leptonycteris yerbabuenae spent more time in torpor in the low sucrose:high Ta treatment, while G. soricina used this strategy for longer periods of time in the high sucrose:low Ta treatment. We found that diet quality and Ta played an important role in the use of torpor by nectar-feeding bats.",

            "abstractNote": "All animals face the essential task of extracting biologically meaningful sensory information from the ‘noisy’ backdrop of their environments. Here, we examine mechanisms used by echolocating bats to localize objects, track small prey and communicate in complex and noisy acoustic environments. Bats actively control and coordinate both the emission and reception of sound stimuli through integrated sensory and motor mechanisms that have evolved together over tens of millions of years. We discuss how bats behave in different ecological scenarios, including detecting and discriminating target echoes from background objects, minimizing acoustic interference from competing conspecifics and overcoming insect noise. Bats tackle these problems by deploying a remarkable array of auditory behaviors, sometimes in combination with the use of other senses. Behavioral strategies such as ceasing sonar call production and active jamming of the signals of competitors provide further insight into the capabilities and limitations of echolocation. We relate these findings to the broader topic of how animals extract relevant sensory information in noisy environments. While bats have highly refined abilities for operating under noisy conditions, they face the same challenges encountered by many other species. We propose that the specialized sensory mechanisms identified in bats are likely to occur in analogous systems across the animal kingdom.",

            "abstractNote": "Many studies have characterized olfactory-tracking behaviors in animals, and it has been proposed that search strategies may be generalizable across a wide range of species. Olfaction is important for fruit- and nectar-feeding bats, but it is uncertain whether existing olfactory search models can predict the strategies of flying mammals that emit echolocation pulses through their nose. Quantitative assessments of how well echolocating bats track and localize odor sources are lacking, so we developed a behavioral assay to characterize the olfactory detection and tracking behavior of crawling northern yellow-shouldered bats (Sturnira parvidens), a common neotropical frugivore. Trained bats were presented with a choice between control and banana-odor-infused solutions in a series of experiments that confirmed that bats are able to locate a reward based on odor cues alone and examined the effect of odor concentration on olfactory search behaviors. Decision distance (the distance from which bats made their change in direction before directly approaching the target) was distinctly bimodal, with an observed peak that coincided with an inflection point in the odor concentration gradient. We observed two main search patterns that are consistent with both serial sampling and learned route-following strategies. These results support the hypothesis that bats can combine klinotaxis with spatial awareness of experimental conditions to locate odor sources, similar to terrestrial mammals. Contrary to existing models, bats did not display prominent head-scanning behaviors during their final approach, which may be due to constraints of nasal-emitted biosonar for orientation.",

            "abstractNote": "The immune system plays an important role in defending against pathogens and regulating physiological homeostasis, but the strength of the immune responses depends on the type of pathogen. The immune system of bats shows a high variability in responsiveness towards various pathogens; they can safely harbor certain pathogens that are highly lethal to other mammals. Oxidative stress may act as a pathophysiological cellular mechanism mediating the immunological function of bats because of its potentially detrimental effects on physiological homeostasis, fertility and longevity. By experimentally exposing greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) to three antigens, it was previously shown that animals reacted immunologically most strongly to bacterial and viral antigens, but not to fungal ones. As a follow up, in this study we observed that both bacterial and fungal antigens induced a significant increase of plasma oxidative damage, whereas viral antigens did not cause any increase of plasma oxidative damage at all albeit the mild immune response. Thus, experimental bats were able to avoid oxidative stress only in the face of a viral antigen, possibly by dampening inflammatory signalling. Bats may be able to handle viral infections and live well beyond expectations by reducing the detrimental effects of molecular oxidation.",

            "abstractNote": "Although it has been widely documented that populations of cave-roosting bats rapidly decline following the arrival of white-nose syndrome (WNS), longer term reproductive effects are less well-known and essentially unexplored at the community scale. In West Virginia, WNS was first detected in the eastern portion of the state in 2009 and winter mortality was documented in 2009 and 2010. However, quantitative impacts on summer bat communities remained unknown. We compared ‘‘historical’’ (pre-WNS) capture records and reproductive rates from 11,734 bats captured during summer (15 May to 15 August) of 1997–2008 and 1,304 captures during 2010. We predicted that capture rates (number of individuals captured/net-night) would decrease in 2010. We also expected the energetic strain of WNS would cause delayed or reduced reproduction, as denoted by a greater proportion of pregnant or lactating females later in the summer and a lower relative proportion of juvenile captures in the mid–late summer. We found a dramatic decline in capture rates of little brown Myotis lucifugus, northern long-eared M. septentrionalis, small-footed M. leibii, Indiana M. sodalis, tri-colored Perimyotis subflavus, and hoary Lasiurus cinereus bats after detection of WNS in 2009. For these six species, 2010 capture rates were 10–37% of pre-WNS rates. Conversely, capture rates of big brown bats Eptesicus fuscus increased by 17% in 2010, whereas capture rates of eastern red bats Lasiurus borealis did not change. Together, big brown and eastern red bats were 58% of all 2010 captures but only 11% of pre-WNS captures. Reproductive data from 12,314 bats showed shifts in pregnancy and lactation dates, and an overall narrowing in the windows of time of each reproductive event, for northern-long-eared and little brown bats. Additionally, the proportion of juvenile captures declined in 2010 for these species. In contrast, lactation and pregnancy rates of big brown and eastern red bats, and the proportion of juveniles, were similar to historical patterns. Our results further elucidate the significance of short-term effects and provide a basis to examine long-term consequences of WNS.",

            "abstractNote": "In the summers of 2011 and 2012, we compared passive and active acoustic sampling for bats at 31 sites at Fort Drum Military Installation, New York. We defined active sampling as acoustic sampling that occurred in 30-min intervals between the hours of sunset and 0200 with a user present to manipulate the directionality of the microphone. We defined passive sampling as acoustic sampling that occurred over a 12-h period (1900–0700 hours) without a user present and with the microphone set in a predetermined direction. We detected seven of the nine possible species at Fort Drum, including the federally endangered Indiana bat Myotis sodalis, the proposed-for-listing northern bat M. septentrionalis, the little brown bat M. lucifugus, and the big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus, which are impacted by whitenose syndrome (WNS); and the eastern red bat Lasiurus borealis, the hoary bat L. cinereus, and the silver-haired bat Lasionycteris noctivagans, which are not known to be impacted by WNS. We did not detect two additional WNSimpacted species known to historically occur in the area: the eastern small-footed bat Myotis leibii and the tri-colored bat Perimyotis subflavus. Single-season occupancy models revealed lower detection probabilities of all detected species using active sampling versus passive sampling. Additionally, overall detection probabilities declined in detected WNSimpacted species between years. A paired t-test of simultaneous sampling on 21 occasions revealed that overall recorded foraging activity per hour was greater using active than passive sampling for big brown bats and greater using passive than active sampling for little brown bats. There was no significant difference in recorded activity between methods for other WNS-impacted species, presumably because these species have been so reduced in number that their ‘‘apparency’’ on the landscape is lower. Finally, a cost analysis of standard passive and active sampling protocols revealed that passive sampling is substantially more cost-effective than active sampling per hour of data collection. We recommend passive sampling over active sampling methodologies as they are defined in our study for detection probability and/or occupancy studies focused on declining bat species in areas that have experienced severe WNS-associated impacts.",

Bat community assemblages in similar forests throughout southeastern United States have been documented in various studies, but only scant data are available for Texas. The purpose of this study was to characterize the assemblage and investigate reproductive patterns of the summer bat community in the austroriparian forest of eastern Texas. Using mist nets, we captured bats during summers 2009–2011 and recorded species, gender, age and reproductive condition. We captured 382 bats of eight species: Seminole Lasiurus seminolus (n = 163), evening Nycticeius humeralis (n = 86), big brown Eptesicus fuscus (n = 57), eastern red Lasiurus borealis (n = 31), southeastern myotis Myotis austroriparius (n = 21), tri-colored Perimyotis subflavus (n = 19), Mexican free-tailed Tadarida brasiliensis (n = 4), and hoary Lasiurus cinereus (n = 1) bats. Analysis of reproductive data suggests that three of these species (big brown, evening, and Seminole bats) may be following a reproductive strategy—extended seasonal monoestry (births of single litters spanning a particular season)—different than their previously reported pattern of synchronous monoestry.",

            "abstractNote": "The listing of the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) as federally threatened under the Endangered Species Act following severe population declines from white-nose syndrome presents considerable challenges to natural resource managers. Because the northern long-eared bat is a forest habitat generalist, development of effective conservation measures will depend on appropriate understanding of its habitat relationships at individual locations. However, severely reduced population sizes make gathering data for such models difficult. As a result, historical data may be essential in development of habitat models. To date, there has been little evaluation of how effective historical bat presence data, such as data derived from mist-net captures, acoustic detection, and day-roost locations, may be in developing habitat models, nor is it clear how models created using different data sources may differ. We explored this issue by creating presence probability models for the northern long-eared bat on the Fernow Experimental Forest in the central Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia using a historical, presence-only data set. Each presence data type produced outputs that were dissimilar but that still corresponded with known traits of the northern long-eared bat or are easily explained in the context of the particular data collection protocol. However, our results also highlight potential limitations of individual data types. For example, models from mist-net capture data only showed high probability of presence along the dendritic network of riparian areas, an obvious artifact of sampling methodology. Development of ecological niche and presence models for northern long-eared bat populations could be highly valuable for resource managers going forward with this species. We caution, however, that efforts to create such models should consider the substantial limitations of models derived from historical data, and address model assumptions.",

A nonlinear viscoelastic model of a hair-like structure coupled to an unsteady nonuniform ﬂow is proposed. Writing the hair model in nondimensional form, we identify ﬁve dimensionless groups that govern hair behavior. An order of magnitude analysis of the physical forces involved in the ﬂuid–structure hair response is performed. Through the choice of hair material properties, we show how a local measure of near surface ﬂow velocity may be obtained from hair tip displacement and resultant moment. When hair structures are placed into an array, time and space accurate hydrodynamic images may be obtained. We illustrate the imaging of reversed ﬂow that occurs during a laminar unsteady ﬂow separation with an array of hair-like structures.",

            "abstractNote": "Parasitism is one of the most diverse and abundant modes of life, and of great ecological and evolutionary importance. Notwithstanding, large groups of parasites remain relatively understudied. One particularly unique form of parasitism is hyperparasitism, where a parasite is parasitized itself. Bats (Chiroptera) may be parasitized by bat ﬂies (Diptera: Hippoboscoidea), obligate blood-sucking parasites, which in turn may be parasitized by hyperparasitic fungi, Laboulbeniales (Ascomycota: Laboulbeniomycetes). In this study, we present the global tritrophic associations among species within these groups and analyze their host speciﬁcity patterns. Bats, bat ﬂies, and Laboulbeniales fungi are shown to form complex networks, and sixteen new associations are revealed. Bat ﬂies are highly host-speciﬁc compared to Laboulbeniales. We discuss possible future avenues of study with regard to the dispersal of the fungi, abiotic factors inﬂuencing the parasite prevalence, and ecomorphology of the bat ﬂy parasites.",

Historic wildﬁres may offer a suitable surrogate to assess long-term burn impacts on bats for planning, implementing and assessing burn programs. To examine the effects of historic ﬁre on bats, we sampled bat activities at 24 transect locations in burned and unburned forest stands in the central Appalachian Mountains of Shenandoah National Park (SNP), Virginia, USA. There was limited evidence of positive ﬁre effects over time on hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus Beauvois) and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus Beauvois) occupancy.",

Here, serum samples from 190 bats, comprising 12 different species, collected in Australia were evaluated for filovirus antibodies. An in-­house indirect microsphere assay to detect antibodies that cross-­react with Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus; EBOV) nucleoprotein (NP) followed by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were used to confirm immunoreactivity to EBOV and Reston virus (Reston ebolavirus; RESTV). We found 27 of 102 Yinpterochiroptera and 19 of 88 Yangochiroptera samples were positive to EBOV NP in the microsphere assay. Further testing of these NP positive samples by IFA revealed nine bat sera that showed binding to ebolavirus-­infected cells. This is the first report of filovirus-­reactive antibodies detected in Australian bat species and suggests that novel filoviruses may be circulating in Australian bats.",

Despite the devastating impact of the COVID-­19 pandemic, there is still little known about the underlying epidemiology and virology of sarbecoviruses in their natural hosts, leaving large gaps in our pandemic preparedness. Here we describe the results of PCR testing for sarbecoviruses in the two horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum) present in Great Britain, collected in 2021–22 during the peak of COVID-1­ 9 pandemic. One hundred and ninety seven R. hipposideros samples from 33 roost sites and 277 R. ferrumequinum samples from 20 roost sites were tested. No coronaviruses were detected in any samples from R. ferrumequinum whereas 44 and 56 % of individual and pooled (respectively) faecal samples from R. hipposideros across multiple roost sites tested positive in a sarbecovirus-­specific qPCR. Full genome sequences were generated from three of the positive samples (and partial genomes from two more) using Illumina RNAseq on unenriched samples. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the obtained sequences belong to the same monophyletic clade, with >95 % similarity to previously-r­ eported European isolates from R. hipposideros. The sequences differed in the presence or absence of accessory genes ORF 7b, 9b and 10. All lacked the furin cleavage site of SARS-C­ oV-­2 spike gene and are therefore unlikely to be infective for humans. These results demonstrate a lack, or at least low incidence, of SARS-C­ oV-2­ spill over from humans to susceptible GB bats, and confirm that sarbecovirus infection is widespread in R. hipposideros. Despite frequently sharing roost sites with R. ferrumequinum, no evidence of cross-­species transmission was found.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats provide numerous ecosystem services as they pollinate, disperse seeds, and reduce insect populations. It is thus vital to monitor and understand their foraging habits. We analyzed sterols and stanols in a rare discovery of a ∼4,300-year-old bat guano deposit from a Jamaican cave to infer relative changes in bat feeding guilds over four millennia. In this deposit, zoosterols and phytosterols, in conjunction with δ13C and C/N data, revealed two periods of increased frugivory relative to insectivory from ca. 1000-500 BCE and ca. 700–1900 CE. We propose two possible explanations for these intervals of increased frugivory relative to insectivory. (1) Previous paleoclimate data suggested these intervals were warmer and drier in the region, which we hypothesize resulted in reduced insect availability. We supported these inferences by comparing the same analytes in fresh guano from frugivorous, insectivorous, and sanguinivorous (blood-drinking) bats, which showed that bats with animal-based diets produced guano with lower C/N ratios and higher cholesterol/(cholesterol + sitosterol) ratios than those with fruit-based diets. (2) The change in the chemical composition of the bat guano during these two periods may also be the result of a shift in the relative species composition of the bat roost that is a greater proportion of frugivorous relative to insectivorous bats during these two periods. This novel, non-invasive method, based on the chemical composition of bat guano, tracked changes in tropical bat foraging habits extending back in time over four millennia.",

            "abstractNote": "This paper presents a palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic approach to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Iberian Peninsula on the basis of the small-mammal assemblages (insectivores, bats and rodents). The LGM is an important period in our climate history defined by the maximum extension of ice sheets between ca. 22 and 19 ka BP. In the Mediterranean region the LGM is characterized by humid conditions, which allow for the development of arboreal vegetation. The small-mammal remains described in this study were recovered from four different sites within the Iberian Peninsula: El Mirón cave (Ramales de la Victoria, Cantabria), Valdavara-1 (Becerreá, Lugo), El Portalón (Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos), and Sala de las Chimeneas (Maltravieso, Cáceres). We found in these sites a non-analogue association represented by species associated with mid-European climatic conditions, such as the voles Chionomys nivalis, Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis and Microtus oeconomus, together with species associated with Mediterranean requirements, such as Microtus (Iberomys) cabrerae and Microtus (Terricola) duodecimcostatus. These assemblages reveal that the climate was harsher than today in the sites under study, though not as rigorous as elsewhere in Europe, with mean annual temperatures lower than present and an environment dominated by wet open meadows. All our data have been compared with other environmental and climatic proxies, global isotope curves and pollen data, providing a scenario for the palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions that occurred during the LGM in the Iberian Peninsula.",

            "abstractNote": "Methods: Anti-HCoV-EMC and anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected using screening indirect immunoﬂuorescence (IF) and conﬁrmatory neutralizing antibody tests.\nResults: Two (2.1%) animal handlers had IF antibody titer of !1:20 against both HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV with neutralizing antibody titer of <1:10. No blood donor had antibody against either virus. Surprisingly, 17/28 (60.7%) of SARS patients had signiﬁcant IF antibody titers with 7/28 (25%) having anti-HCoV-EMC neutralizing antibodies at low titers which signiﬁcantly correlated with that of HCoV-OC43. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a signiﬁcant B-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of Spike protein. Virulence of SARS-CoV over other betacoronaviruses may boost cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against other betacoronaviruses.\nConclusions: Convalescent SARS sera may contain cross-reactive antibodies against other betacoronaviruses and confound seroprevalence study for HCoV-EMC. ª 2013 The British Infection Association.

Medium components and other physical parameters affecting xylanase yield were optimized using Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology constituting 17 experimental runs with 3 variables. The BBD showed increased xylanase activity of 2598.14 U/g using bat faeces as substrate along with 100% of moisture, 1.5% w/w of birchwood xylan, and 0.8% w/w of yeast extract. Xylanase was puriﬁed using chromatographic techniques which revealed its molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa. The partially puriﬁed enzyme exhibited stability at 60 °C and alkaline pH. Poultry feed was treated with puriﬁed xylanase which showed increment in the total reducing sugar content (88%) with respect to control. In conclusion, strain LLD06 associated xylanase exhibited stability towards high temperature and pH with potential application in poultry industries. The study represents the hyper-production of xylanase from P. nitroreducens using bat faeces as ideal substrate and its pivotal role in poultry feed digestion.",
