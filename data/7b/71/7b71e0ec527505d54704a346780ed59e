            "abstractNote": "The ﬂapping ﬂight of many bat species is characterized by a high degree of maneuverability and provides fertile ground for biomimetic design. However, there has been little prior work toward understanding bat ﬂight maneuvers, particularly using a coupled kinematic and aerodynamic framework. Here, wing kinematic data of a large insectivorous bat (Hipposideros armiger) in straight and turning ﬂight is investigated. Fundamental to turning ﬂight are asymmetries in the wing kinematics and consequently asymmetries in the aerodynamic forces. Forces were calculated from the wing kinematics using aerodynamic numerical simulations. Aspects of the wing kinematics in the turn that were distinguishable from straight ﬂight were an increase in stroke plane deviation angle, nominal increase in ﬂapping amplitude, and a decrease in the horizontal stroke plane angle of the wing inside the turn. While prior work on the mechanics of turning ﬂight in animals has focused on classifying a turn as either banking or yawing, in the present work we show evidence of simultaneous and synergistic banking and yawing mechanisms. During the initiation of the turn, the bank angle was low, and elevated thrust by the outside wing generated a signiﬁcant yaw rotational moment during both the upstroke and downstroke. Later in the turn, the bank angle increased to approximately 25 degrees tilting the net force vector toward the inside of the turn providing centripetal acceleration thereby turning the bat. Understanding the details of the turning mechanism—combined yaw and bank—provides useful design and control principles for biomimetic ﬂapping MAVs.",

A case study of the endangered Paciﬁc sheath-tailed bat (Emballonura semicaudata rotensis) illustrates the importance of investigating indirect effects of invasion on species of conservation concern. We hypothesized that two invaders, feral goats and Lantana camara, would indirectly affect the bat by decreasing availability of suitable resources. Speciﬁcally, that microclimate and bat prey abundances in lantana shrub differ from native forest habitat, and that preferential browsing by goats structures forests to be less suitable for bats. Our results suggest that bats avoid lantana shrub. However, we found no evidence that preferential goat browsing inﬂuenced bat activity. Our research implies that the impact of lantana on the persistence of the bat has been underestimated and that it is unclear how goats alter bat habitat aside from reducing understory vegetation. Future managers should prioritize efforts that restore native forest and reforest areas currently dominated by lantana. We urge conservation scientists to evaluate indirect effects of invasive species and publish ﬁndings that elucidate the consequences for native populations.",

Multiple-species approaches, particular those which employ site-occupancy estimation, have been proposed as robust and efﬁcient alternatives for assessing the status of wildlife populations over large spatial scales, but implemented examples are few. I used bats as a model to evaluate design considerations for the use of occupancy estimation to assess population status and habitat associations for eight species of bats covered under a regional conservation plan. Bats were one of the groups expected to beneﬁt from a system of reserves for species associated with late-successional/old-growth (LSOG) habitat designated under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP). This study produced the ﬁrst estimates for probabilities of occupancy and detection for bats at a regional scale. Overall probabilities of occupancy ranged from 0.586 to 0.783 and probabilities of detection ranged from 0.239 to 0.532 among the eight species modeled. Although point estimates of occupancy suggested association with NWFP habitat categories for some species, estimate precision was low. Models that assumed constant occupancy with respect to reserve- and LSOG-status were supported for most species. I used model-averaged estimates of occupancy and detection for each species to estimate survey effort necessary to meet precision targets. Occupancy estimation was best suited to species with the highest detection probabilities. Species that are rare or difﬁcult to detect will require enhancement in survey methods or more intensive survey effort to produce meaningful estimates. Optimizing monitoring efforts to address multiple species requires tradeoffs among survey methods, levels of effort, and acceptable levels of precision.",

            "abstractNote": "Unlike ﬂapping birds and insects, bats possess membrane wings that are more similar to many gliding mammals. The vast majority of the wing is composed of a thin compliant skin membrane stretched between the limbs, hand, and body. Membrane wings are of particular interest because they may offer many advantages to micro air vehicles. One critical feature of membrane wings is that they camber passively in response to aerodynamic load, potentially allowing for simpliﬁed wing control. However, for maximum membrane wing performance, tuning of the membrane structure to aerodynamic conditions is necessary. Bats possess an array of muscles, the plagiopatagiales proprii, embedded within the wing membrane that could serve to tune membrane stiffness, or may have alternative functions. We recorded the electromyogram from the plagiopatagiales proprii muscles of Artibeus jamaicensis, the Jamaican fruit bat, in ﬂight at two different speeds and found that these muscles were active during downstroke. For both lowand high-speed ﬂight, muscle activity increased between late upstroke and early downstroke and decreased at late downstroke. Thus, the array of plagiopatagiales may provide a mechanism for bats to increase wing stiffness and thereby reduce passive membrane deformation. These muscles also activate in synchrony, presumably as a means to maximize force generation, because each muscle is small and, by estimation, weak. Small differences in activation timing were observed when comparing low- and high-speed ﬂight, which may indicate that bats modulate membrane stiffness differently depending on ﬂight speed.",

Understanding the origin of this coronavirus is important for the prevention of future outbreaks. The dominant point of view that the virus transferred to humans either directly from bats or through an intermediate mammalian host has been challenged by Segreto and Deigin, who claim that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has certain features suggestive of its artificial creation. Following their response to our commentary, here we continue the discussion of the proposed arguments for this hypothesis. We show that neither the existence of a furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2, nor the presence of specific sequences within the nucleotide insertion encoding that site are evidence for intelligent design. We also explain why existing genetic data, viral diversity and past human history suggest that a natural origin of the virus is the most likely scenario. Genetic evidence suggesting otherwise is yet to be presented.",

            "abstractNote": "Climate and land-cover changes are among major threats to biodiversity. However, the interactive effects of the two threats are often overlooked in conservation planning. Using 81 bat species occurring in Vietnam as a case, we investigated the individual and interactive effects of climate and land-cover changes, highlighting the importance of this information for conservation efforts. By using species distribution models, we predicted the potential changes in range size among species and in species richness across Vietnam by the 2050s, considering projected climate and land-cover changes under two emission scenarios. Our results revealed that both threats individually would have predominantly negative effects on bats in Vietnam. Moreover, when these threats occur simultaneously, their interactions would generally intensify the impacts by mitigating individual positive effects and/or enhancing negative effects. However, we also found large interspecific and geographic variations in the direction and magnitude of these effects. Forest specialists, insectivores and cave-roosting species were predicted to be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects, with northern and southern Vietnam being more affected. These results underscore the urgent need to incorporate both climate and land-cover changes, as well as their interactions, into conservation planning for bats in Vietnam and biodiversity in general. The species-specific and spatially-explicit information regarding the impacts of the two threats can guide conservation actions, allowing us to target more manageable and less uncertain threats, as well as prioritize the protection of more vulnerable species.",

Foragers acting optimally are expected to exploit feeding patches depending on the cost/benefit ratio, and some noises can cause increased foraging costs. We hypothesized that traffic noise affects foraging patch quality for aerial-insectivorous bats and predicted that there are measurable differences in their foraging activity and in their echolocation signals be­ tween nights with or without traffic noise. We tested these predictions in the Lesser Bulldog Bat, Noctilio albi­ ventris, foraging over aquaculture fishponds, by recording bat activity on nights playing traffic noise and on traffic-sound free control nights. We measured foraging activity by counting the number of search passes and feeding buzzes made by the bats and measured several characteristics of echolocation signals. Foraging activity was higher during noisy nights than during control ones, probably due to the need of more time to obtain in­ formation about prey under noisy conditions. When exposed to traffic noise, the bats changed the spectral and temporal characteristics of echolocation signals. We suggest that exposure to traffic noise increases foraging costs for N. albiventris and posit that these bats continue foraging under noisy conditions because they can modulate their echolocation signals to obtain enough information.",

            "abstractNote": "To maintain group cohesion while coordinating group movements, individuals might use signals to advertise the location of a route, their intention to initiate movements, or their position at a given time. In highly mobile animals, the latter is often accomplished through contact calls that are emitted at different rates by group members. Here, we describe and quantify intraand intergroup variation in contact calling rates in Spix’s disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor), a species that employs distinct inquiry and response calls to coordinate group movements during flight and while announcing roost locations. We evaluate the extent to which groups are composed of individuals with similar calling rates and estimate variation among and within groups. Our results show large variation in response calling rates among and within groups, both in terms of calling rates and the probability of being vocal or not; for example, a large portion (35%) of bats sampled did not produce these signals. For inquiry calls, we found that variation in calling rates was greater within than among groups, and in contrast to response calls, only a few individuals (3%) did not produce inquiry calls. Overall, we found support for the existence of intra- and intergroup differences in the context of contact calling in disc-winged bats, and our results suggest that different mechanisms may promote the evolution and maintenance of varying calling rates for the two types of calls studied.",

            "abstractNote": "Among mammals, bats exhibit extreme variation in sociality, with some species living largely solitary lives while others form colonies of more than a million individuals. Some tropical species form groups during the day that persist throughout the year while many temperate species only gather into groups during hibernation or parturition. How groups form and then persist has now been described for a number of species, but the degree to which kinship explains patterns of association has never been quantified across species. Here, we use social network analysis and genetic data to determine the extent to which relatedness contributes to associations among individuals estimated from free-ranging animals across nine species from four families of bats. Network analysis reveals that all species show evidence of emergent social structure. Variation in the strength of the relationship between genetic relatedness and social association appears to be related to the degree of roost switching, i.e., species in which individuals change roosts frequently tend to exhibit higher levels of association among relatives. Sex-biased dispersal determines whether associations were between male or female relatives. The strength of associations among kin does not predict known occurrence of complex behaviors, such as dominance or various types of cooperation, indicating that kinship is not a prerequisite for social complexity in bats.",

The bat fauna of this Balkan country is one of the least studied in Europe. In order to reduce this knowledge gap, bat research was carried out during a ten-day inventory in the vicinity of Čajniče in south-eastern BiH (Republic of Srpska). Mist net surveys resulted in the capture of 15 bat species: Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, R. hipposideros, Myotis brandtii, M. mystacinus sensu lato, M. alcathoe, M. emarginatus, M. nattereri, M. bechsteinii, M. blythii, Nyctalus leisleri, Eptesicus serotinus, Vespertilio murinus, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, and Plecotus auritus. Acoustic surveys resulted in recording one additional species: Barbastella barbastellus. Roost surveys yielded in the finding of three maternity colonies of R. hipposideros. The genetic analysis resulted in the first molecularly confirmed M. brandtii and M. alcathoe records for BiH. Capture of several post-lactating females, sexually active males and multiple juveniles is proof for reproducing populations of these species in the country. During this brief study, we found more than half of all known bat species in BiH in an area of circa 75 km2.",

            "abstractNote": "Traditionally, morphological characters were used for judging phylogenetic relationships. These features, however, are prone to convergent evolution, and therefore, some aspects of intrafamilial and most interfamilial relationships remained unsolved to a large extent. In recent times, genetic features were used to elucidate phylogenetic relationships in Chiroptera. In the following chapter, a short introduction to classical and molecular cytogenetic methods is given. Furthermore, types of chromosomal rearrangements detected by application of such techniques are described. Amongst the large number of characters obtained by comparative karyological analysis, two cytogenetic features, i.e. inv 2 and inv 5, could serve as synapomorphies for the suborder Pteropodiformes. This ﬁnding supports recent molecular genetic results which proposed a basal division of Chiroptera into Pteropodiformes and Vespertilioniformes, rejecting the traditional division into Mega- and Microchiroptera. Concerning the phylogenetic relationships within the superfamily Emballonuroidea, however, cytogenetic results are not consistent with traditional views. On the one hand, a common character connecting the genera Taphozous and Emballonura was not found. On the other hand, similarity in three chromosomal features suggests a closer relationship between Emballonura and Nycteris than hitherto suspected.",

            "abstractNote": "Eighteen non-marine mammal species (including seven species of bats) were\nrecorded from a total of 49 islands in the Wessel and English Company island\nchains off north-eastern Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. Most individual\nspecies were restricted to, or had higher incidence on, larger islands, and\nspecies richness as a whole increased as island size increased. The most\nnotable exception was the semi-aquatic\nHydromys chrysogaster, which occurred relatively\nequitably across island sizes; this species, two bat species and the macropod\nPetrogale brachyotis were recorded from islands smaller\nthan 10 ha. However, the variation between islands in the number of native\nterrestrial mammal species was not best predicted by island size, but rather\nby a combination of sampling effort and altitude (which explained 64%\nof the deviance in species richness), or altitude and distance to larger land\nmass (explaining 63% of deviance).\nRichness–area patterns for individual islands in these chains were\nreasonably consistent with those of other islands sampled in northern\nAustralia. However, the fauna of the Wessel and English Company groups as a\nwhole was less rich than that of the Pellew and Kimberley islands, and\nindividual islands appeared to have lower species richness than comparable\nmainland areas. Species that were notably absent or that were recorded from\nrelatively few islands include large macropods,\nTachyglossus aculeatus, Antechinus bellus, Phascogale tapoatafa, Sminthopsis spp., Mesembriomys gouldii, Rattus colletti, Leggadina lakedownensis\nand Pseudomys calabyi. Some of these species may be\nabsent through lack of suitable habitat; others have presumably disappeared\nsince isolation, possibly due to Aboriginal hunting.\nRichness at the quadrat (50 × 50 m) scale was generally very low.\nHabitat relationships are described for the 7 species recorded from more than\n5 quadrats. At a quadrat-scale, the richness of native mammals was greater on\nislands larger than 1000 ha than on islands smaller than 1000 ha.\nQuadrat-scale species richness varied significantly among the islands sampled\nby the most quadrats (even when the comparison was restricted to either of the\ntwo most extensive vegetation types), but this variation was not closely\nrelated to either area or altitude. The two most frequently recorded species,\nthe rodents Melomys burtoni and\nZyzomys argurus, showed distinct habitat segregation on\nislands where both were present, but tended to expand their habitat range on\nislands where only one of the species occurred.\nThe most notable conservation feature of the mammal fauna of the Wessel and\nEnglish Company Islands is the occurrence of the golden bandicoot,\nIsoodon auratus, a vulnerable species apparently now\nextinct on the Northern Territory mainland. Four feral animal species\n(Rattus rattus, Canis familiaris, Bubalus bubalis and\nCapra hircus) were recorded from a total of 6 islands.",

Andersen argued that the Macroglossinae, containing the eonycterine and notopterine sections, are a monophyletic sister-group to other fruitbats (i.e. Andersen's Rousettus, Cynopterus and Epomophorus sections). Two recent molecular studies (DNA hybridisation and restriction mapping of ribosomal cistrons), as well as an analysis of female reproductive characters, challenge the monophyly of the Macroglossinae and several of Andersen's other conclusions such as the phylogenetic position of Nyctimene. We performed a cladistic analysis on 36 morphological characters, including 33 that were gleaned from Andersen, to determine whether phylogenetic hypotheses based on modem phylogenetic methods are in agreement with Andersen's original conclusions and to compare morphological and molecular phylogenetic hypotheses. Minimum-length trees based on parsimony are largely consistent with Andersen and support (1) a monophyletic Macroglossinae, within which the eonycterine section is paraphyletic with respect to a monophyletic notopterine section, (2) a monophyletic Cynopterus section, excepting the exclusion of Myonycteris, (3) a monophyletic Epomophorus section, excepting the exclusion of Plerotes, and (4) a paraphyletic Rousettus section, with several of the Rousettus-like forms branching off near the base of the tree. Bootstrapping analyses on a reduced data-set that included taxa shared in common with the DNA hybridisation study did not provide strong support (2 95%) for any clades but didprovide moderate support ( 2 70) for several clades, including a monophyletic Macroglossinae.These findings are in marked contrast to the DNA hybridisation phylogeny. A high index of between-data-setincongruence is further evidence for the clash between DNA hybridisation and morphology.",

Esta situación no permite una correcta implementación de los esfuerzos de conservación aún cuando son legalmente reconocidos por sus beneficios para la agricultura. En este trabajo estudiamos la actividad y la comunidad de murciélagos en dos tipos de paisaje agrícola (homogéneo vs. heterogéneo) en un hotspot de biodiversidad en el centro‐sur de Chile. Para ello, monitoreamos cuatro transectos de 10 km en cada tipo de paisaje, con 10 puntos de escucha separados por 1 km. Estos transectos se repitieron 5 veces, una vez al mes. Evaluamos la actividad de los murciélagos según el tipo de cobertura forestal (nativa, mixta y plantaciones) y la densidad de árboles aislados. Nuestros resultados mostraron que el paisaje heterogéneo fue dominado por\n              Tadarida brasiliensis\n              mientras que el paisaje homogéneo fue dominado por\n              Lasiurus\n              spp. Sin embargo, sólo la especie\n              T. brasiliensis\n              fue afectada por el tipo de paisaje. En el paisaje heterogéneo, sólo las variables de cobertura forestal tuvieron un impacto significativo en la actividad de las especies de murciélagos, donde\n              Lasiurus\n              spp. y\n              Myotis chiloensis\n              tuvieron una respuesta positiva para bosque nativo y mixto, así como\n              Lasiurus\n              spp. tuvo una respuesta negativa para plantaciones. La densidad de árboles aislados tuvo un efecto negativo sobre la actividad de\n              T. brasiliensis\n              y\n              Lasiurus\n              spp. en el tipo de paisaje homogéneo.

However, emerging evidence suggests that they are failing to achieve intended conservation outcomes as they only support generalist species. Despite these concerns, the effect of bat boxes on the dynamics of bat communities remains understudied. We assessed the bat community in reserves where bat boxes had been installed in comparison with reserves where they had not using ultrasonic surveys in 16 small bushland reserves throughout Sydney, Australia. Reserves containing bat boxes and those without had comparable species diversity and composition; however, the activity of the dominant species, Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii), was significantly higher at sites with bat boxes. Species that commonly forage in open vegetation, including C. gouldii, were significantly positively associated with sites that had bat boxes. Occupation of boxes by bats was not recorded in the study due to limited information on their locations, so further research is required to understand the direct effects of boxes and the bats that occupy them on the bat community. If bat boxes continue to be recommended as a biodiversity offset, a greater understanding of the potential impact they have on altered competitive relationships and community dynamics is essential.",

            "abstractNote": "Tree declines have been recorded across forests and woodlands on most continents, causing tree mortality over thousands of square kilometres, yet the impact of tree declines upon mammals have only rarely been quantiﬁed. Once the dominant tree over the western parts of the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia, tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) forest has been reduced to less than a third of its former range through clearing for agriculture and urban development. Additionally, over the last 30 years, the remnant population has been heavily impacted by a decline that has an unknown cause, but is likely related to a root pathogen coupled with abiotic factors (reduced rainfall, increased salinity and elevated temperatures). Tuart decline is evident as marked canopy dieback, replacement with epicormic growth and increasing bare branches, while leaf litter is lost from the tree surrounds. We examined the effect of tuart decline and other vegetation measures upon bat activity using auditory monitoring. Vegetation structure was correlated with Vespertilionidae bat activity. Falsistrellus mackenziei were more likely to forage around healthy canopies (activity positively correlated with tuart crown density and negatively correlated with tuart crown dieback). By contrast, the other three taxa were more often encountered in declining rather than healthy tuart sites. Chalinolobus gouldii was positively associated with tuart crown dieback. Activity of Vespadelus regulus and Nyctophilus spp. (species not distinguishable from their calls) were signiﬁcantly positively correlated with an open tall canopy (positively with cover of plants >10 m tall and negatively with overall canopy cover density). There were no vegetation measurements that were strong predictors of activity of two Molossidae species (Ozimops kitcheneri and Austronomus australis), which intercept insects above the forest canopy. This study clearly reveals different factors inﬂuencing the activity of bat taxa, which are likely related to where they feed and their manoeuvrability around tree canopies.",

In this study, we used comparative transcriptomics of cochlea to investigate the sex-related difference in gene expression and alternative splicing in four Rhinolophus taxa. Based on 31 cochlear transcriptomes, we performed differential gene expression (DGE) and alternative splicing (AS) analyses between the sexes in each taxon. Consistent with the degree of difference in the echolocation pulse frequency between the sexes across the four taxa, we identified the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and alternatively spliced genes (ASGs) in R. sinicus. However, we also detected multiple DEGs and ASGs in taxa without sexual differences in echolocation pulse frequency, suggesting that these genes might be related to other parameters of echolocation pulse rather than the frequency component. Some DEGs and ASGs are related to hearing loss or deafness genes in human or mice and they can be considered to be candidates associated with the sexual differences of echolocation pulse in bats. We also detected more than the expected overlap of DEGs and ASGs in two taxa. Overall, our current study supports the important roles of both DGE and AS in generating or maintaining sexual differences in animals.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat groups have a high degree of species diversity, and the taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships among bat species have always been research hotspots. Due to the fact that morphological characteristics do not always reﬂect the evolutionary relationships among species, mitochondrial DNA has been widely used in the study of species relationships due to its maternal inheritance pattern. Myotis aurascens has been suggested as a possible synonym for M. davidii. However, the status of this classiﬁcation has been controversial. In this study, the morphological and molecular characteristics of a M. aurascens captured from Inner Mongolia, China, were analyzed to determine its taxonomic status. In terms of morphological features, the body weight was 6.33 g, the head and body length were 45.10 mm, the forearm length was 35.87 mm, and the tragus length was 7.51 mm. These values all fell within the species signature data range. Nucleotide skew analysis of the protein-coding genes (PCGs) suggested that only ﬁve PCGs (ND1, ND2, COX2, ATP8, and ND4) showed AT-skew value within the mitogenome of M. aurascens. Except for ND6, the GC-skew values of the other PCGs were negative, reﬂecting the preference for C and T bases compared to G and A bases. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial PCGs indicated that M. aurascens was a distinct species from M. davidii and phylogenetically closer to M. ikonnikovi, M. alcathoe, and M. mystacinus. Genetic distance analysis also showed that M. aurascens and M. davidii were distantly related. Therefore, the integrated analysis demonstrated that M. aurascens should be considered a distinct species rather than a synonym of M. davidii. Our study could provide a reference for enriching species diversity and research on conservation in China.",

            "abstractNote": "Chiroptera are one of the most diverse mammal orders. They are considered reservoirs of main human pathogens, where coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) may be highlighted. Moreover, the growing number of publications on CoVs and PMVs in wildlife reinforces the scientific community’s interest in eco-vigilance, especially because of the emergence of important human pathogens such as the SARS-CoV-2 and Nipha viruses. Considering that Brazil presents continental dimensions, is biologically rich containing one of the most diverse continental biotas and presents a rich biodiversity of animals classified in the order Chiroptera, the mapping of CoV and PMV genetics related to human pathogens is important and the aim of the present work. CoVs can be classified into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. Delta- and gammacoronaviruses infect mainly birds, while alpha- and betacoronaviruses contain important animal and human pathogens. Almost 60% of alpha- and betacoronaviruses are related to bats, which are considered natural hosts of these viral genera members. The studies on CoV presence in bats from Brazil have mainly assayed phyllostomid, molossid and vespertilionid bats in the South, Southeast and North territories. Despite Brazil not hosting rhinophilid or pteropodid bats, which are natural reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs and henipaviruses, respectively, CoVs and PMVs reported in Brazilian bats are genetically closely related to some human pathogens. Most works performed with Brazilian bats reported alpha-CoVs that were closely related to other bat-CoVs, despite a few reports of beta-CoVs grouped in the Merbecovirus and Embecovirus subgenera. The family Paramyxoviridae includes four subfamilies (Avulavirinae, Metaparamyxovirinae, Orthoparamyxovirinae and Rubulavirinae), and bats are significant drivers of PMV cross-species viral transmission. Additionally, the studies that have evaluated PMV presence in Brazilian bats have mainly found sequences classified in the Jeilongvirus and Morbillivirus genera that belong to the Orthoparamyxovirinae subfamily. Despite the increasing amount of research on Brazilian bats, studies analyzing these samples are still scarce. When surveying the representativeness of the CoVs and PMVs found and the available genomic sequences, it can be perceived that there may be gaps in the knowledge. The continuous monitoring of viral sequences that are closely related to human pathogens may be helpful in mapping and predicting future hotspots in the emergence of zoonotic agents.",

This raises concern about ongoing expansion of offshore wind-energy development off the Atlantic Coast. Season, atmospheric conditions, and site-level characteristics such as local habitat (e.g., forest coverage) have been shown to inﬂuence wind turbine collision rates by bats onshore, and therefore may be related to risk offshore. Therefore, to assess the factors affecting coastal presence of bats, we continuously gathered tree bat occurrence data using stationary acoustic recorders on ﬁve structures (four lighthouses on barrier islands and one light tower offshore) off the coast of Virginia, USA, across all seasons, 2012–2019. We used generalized additive models to describe tree bat occurrence on a nightly basis. We found that sites either indicated maternity or migratory seasonal occurrence patterns associated with local roosting resources, i.e., presence of trees. Across all sites, nightly occurrence was negatively related to wind speed and positively related to temperature and visibility. Using predictive performance metrics, we concluded that our model was highly predictive for the Virginia coast. Our ﬁndings were consistent with other studies—tree bat occurrence probability and presumed mortality risk to offshore wind-energy collisions is highest on low wind speed nights, high temperature and visibility nights, and during spring and fall. The high predictive model performance we observed provides a basis for which managers, using a similar monitoring and modeling regime, could develop an effective curtailment-based mitigation strategy.",

            "abstractNote": "The hipposideros larvatus (intermediate roundleaf bat) is one of the insectivorous bats which has an agro-ecological role as a controller of the insect population. The reproductive patterns of H. larvatus are intricately linked to its ecological role and survival. An understanding of the testicular morphology can contribute to conservation for this species particularly in areas where its populations might be declining or under threat. However, these bats may also be associated with zoonotic diseases which can have signiﬁcant public health implications. The aims of the study were to examine the morphological data as well as the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in the male reproductive organs of H. larvatus from different areas of Thailand and at different sampling periods. Their testes were processed for histological investigation and immunohistochemistry for AR and AMH. The results showed differences among the various sampling areas and different sampling periods, which suggested seasonal breeding characteristics. The higher testicular morphometric data were observed in H. larvatus from the Dong Phayayen (DY) and Chiang Dao (CD) areas during June, while the size of seminiferous tubules decreased thereafter. High AR immunostaining was noticed when the testicular morphometric data were higher in DY bats during June. On the other hand, low AR was observed in bats during August and September, which was concomitant with the decreases in seminiferous tubule size and germinal epithelial height. The results suggest a potential correlation between AR immunostaining and the active phase of testicular functions in H. larvatus during June which may imply the involvement of AR with the enhancement of testicular activity. Conversely, the low expression of AR may contribute to the upregulation of AMH in the testes and may indicate lower testicular activity in H. larvatus in Thailand.",

            "abstractNote": "Leptonycteris nivalis (the Mexican long-nosed bat) is an endangered nectar-feeding bat species that follows “nectar corridors” as it migrates from Mexico to the southwestern United States. Locating these nectar corridors is key to their conservation and may be possible using environmental DNA (eDNA) from these bats. Hence, we developed and tested DNA metabarcoding and qPCR eDNA assays to determine whether L. nivalis could be detected by sampling the agave ﬂowers on which it feeds. We sampled plants with known bat visitations in the Sierra Madre Oriental in Laguna de Sanchez (LS), Nuevo León, Mexico, and in the Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA (CB). A total of 13 samples included both swabs of agave umbels and cuttings of individual ﬂowers. DNA metabarcoding was performed as a PCR multiplex that targeted bats (SFF-COI), arthropods (ANML-COI), and plants (ITS2 and rbcL). We targeted arthropods and plants in parallel with bats because future metabarcoding studies may wish to examine all the pollinators and plants within the nectar corridor. We developed and tested the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of two qPCR assays. We found that both DNA metabarcoding and qPCR were highly successful at detecting L. nivalis (11 of 13 for DNA metabarcoding and 12 of 13 for qPCR). Swabs and ﬂower cuttings and both qPCR assays detected the species over four replicates. We suggest that L. nivalis leaves substantial DNA behind as it forages for nectar. We also suggest that future studies examine the time since sampling to determine its effect on detection success. The DNA metabarcoding multiplex will be useful for parallel questions regarding pollination ecology, while, with further testing, the qPCR assays will be effective for large-scale sampling for the detection of migration corridors and foraging areas. This work may be relevant to other nectar-feeding bat species, which can likely be detected with similar methodologies.",

Data collection included mist-netting, radiotelemetry, reconstruction of prey items, and monitoring of roosting sites. Body measurements conﬁrm a high degree of phenotypic similarity between the two species. Total activity areas (100% Minimum Convex Polygons, MCPS) of Plecotus austriacus (2828.3 ± 1269.43 ha) were up to ﬁve-fold larger compared to Plecotus auritus (544.54 ± 295.89 ha). The activity areas of Plecotus austriacus contained up to 11 distinct core areas, and their mean total size (149.7 ± 0.07 ha) was approximately three-fold larger compared to core areas of Plecotus auritus (49.2 ± 25.6 ha). The mean distance between consecutive ﬁxes per night was 12.72 ± 3.7 km for Plecotus austriacus and 4.23 ± 2.8 km for Plecotus auritus. While Plecotus austriacus was located most frequently over pastures (>40%) and meadows (>20%), P. auritus was located mostly within deciduous (>50%) and mixed forests (>30%) in close vicinity to its roosts. Roost site monitoring indicates that the activity of P. austriacus is delayed relative to P. auritus in spring and declined earlier in autumn. These phenological differences are probably related to the species’ respective diets. Levins’ measure of trophic niche breadth suggests that the prey spectrum for P. auritus is more diverse during spring (B = 2.86) and autumn (B = 2.82) compared to P. austriacus (spring: B = 1.7; autumn: B = 2.1). Our results give reason to consider these interspeciﬁc ecological variations and species-speciﬁc requirements of P. auritus and P. austriacus to develop adapted and improved conservation measures.",

            "abstractNote": "Relatively high mortality of migratory bats at wind energy facilities has prompted research to understand the underlying spatial and temporal factors, with the goal of developing more effective mitigation approaches. We examined acoustic recordings of echolocation calls at 12 sites and postconstruction carcass survey data collected at 10 wind energy facilities in Ontario, Canada, to quantify the degree to which timing and regional-scale weather predict bat activity and mortality. Rain and low temperatures consistently predicted low mortality and activity of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and three species of migratory tree bats: hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), eastern red bat (L. borealis), and silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Bat activity occurred in waves with distinct peaks through the season; regardless of seasonal timing, most activities occurred in the ﬁrst half of the night. We conclude that wind energy facilities could adopt a novel and more effective curtailment strategy based on weather and seasonal and nocturnal timing that would minimize mortality risks for bats while increasing the opportunities for power generation, relative to the mitigation strategy of increasing cut-in wind speed to 5.5 m/s.",

            "abstractNote": "Grooming patterns among 65 common vampire bats in hollow tree day roosts were studied by behavioural sampling techniques during a 15-month period. Self-grooming occurred more than social grooming in response to ectoparasites since the proportion of time spent self-grooming and the amount of ectoparasite infestation covaried positively among tree roosts, while the time spent grooming others was independent of roost and ectoparasite level. Rates of social grooming were not independent of the sex of participants due to infrequent social grooming by adult males. Two variables, the level of relatedness and a measure of roosting association, which previously were shown to predict food sharing by regurgitation, correlated positively with the rate of social grooming. Since social grooming occurred more often than expected before a regurgitation and correlated with regurgitation frequency, it is suggested that this behaviour facilitates identification of food sharing partners by enabling a grooming bat to monitor other animals' potential for giving or receiving blood.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats have been shown to provide successful pest suppression in different land-use systems globally. Recent research demonstrates high economic values of pest suppression by bats also in macadamia orchards, which is enhanced by natural habitat patches at orchard edges. We investigated the impact of the conversion of natural to agricultural (macadamia-dominated) habitats. Using ~65,000 recorded bat call sequences; we studied bat communities in three land use types: a nature reserve, macadamia orchards with and without adjacent natural habitat patches. All study sites are situated on the southern slopes of the Soutpansberg, northern South Africa. Species richness varied significantly between the nature reserve and the macadamia orchards, but did not be­ tween orchards with and without neighbouring natural habitat. Within the orchards, activity of edge space foraging (dependent on e.g. forest edges) bats was greater at natural edges, whereas open space aerial foraging species (hunting above canopy) were more active at human-modified edges. Although seven narrow space foraging (i.e. dense vegetation dependent) bat species were identified at both orchard and reserve, this foraging guild occurred more frequently in the nature reserve (2.9–4.1% of all call sequences) than in the orchards (0.5–2.9% of all call sequences). Narrow space foraging bats were thus largely excluded from simplified agri­ cultural landscapes, in particular where natural edge habitats are missing, compared to our natural control. The current trend in conversion of natural habitat in favour of macadamia monocultures, especially if remnant natural patches at orchard boundaries are removed, will have widespread detrimental effects on bat diversity. The resulting reduced biological pest suppression by bats and increased reliance on chemical control may further exacerbate biodiversity declines.",
