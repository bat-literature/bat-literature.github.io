Here, we provide the first comprehensive faunal list of caves and other subterranean habitats in the state based on over 40 years of periodic surveys and compilation of literature, biodiversity databases, and museum records. We report 475 occurrences from 127 caves, springs, and wells in 29 counties, representing 5 phyla, 17 classes, 43 orders, 90 families, 124 genera, and at least 164 species. Vertebrate fauna comprised 32 species, including 4 fishes, 9 salamanders, 1 lizard, 4 snakes, 2 birds, and 12 mammals (8 bats). Diverse invertebrate groups included spiders (11 families and 18 genera), springtails (7 families and 9 genera), segmented worms (3 families and 8 genera), and snails (6 families and 9 genera). At least 25 taxa are troglobites/ stygobites (cave obligates), including 5 species of cave flatworms, 5 cave springtails, and 5 cave amphipods. Most troglobitic/stygobitic fauna documented in this study are endemic to North Carolina. Counties with the greatest cave biodiversity include Rutherford, McDowell, Swain, Henderson, Polk, and Avery counties. Over 20 species documented are of conservation concern, including 14 troglobites and 3 federally-listed bats. Although not as diverse as adjacent states, caves and other subterranean habitats in North Carolina support a diverse community of invertebrates and vertebrates. Our review serves as a base line for future cave biological surveys in the state and highlights the importance of subterranean habitats for North Carolina biodiversity.",

Most of the studies on these environments focus on archaeology and animals that occur in caves. However, there are several caves that are threatened by urban development of the surrounding areas. The Bakwena Cave is such a threatened cave with extensive urban development of the surrounding grassland biome it is located in. The cave is located in dolomite and the entrance is a sinkhole. This cave serves as a permanent roost for a large population of Natal clinging bats Miniopterus natalensis. The ecosystem of the cave is driven by the deposition of guano by the bats, as there is no deep penetration of plant debris from the outside. To identify the fungal component of the microbial ecosystem, we sampled guano, soil, and sediment from various areas within the cave over a period of one year. All isolations were performed on low-nutrient medium to restrict the colony growth and to ensure that all culturable fungi were obtained. These isolates were barcoded using the ITS1 gene region to identify them and to establish a baseline of fungi occurring in South African caves. The majority of isolates associated were Aspergillus and Penicillium species identified in previous studies from cave environments. Some opportunistic pathogens were identified that could have an impact as more people visit the cave due to its close proximity to housing developments. However, currently the cave fits a model that indicates it has a low level of human disturbance. Our study is the first on the cave fungal component in South Africa and provides a baseline that can advise developers and environmental impact assessments on fungal species found in caves.",

            "abstractNote": "Fluxes of resource subsidy across ecosystems can affect consumer-community dynamics in recipient systems. Bracken Cave is an unusual ecosystem because of the magnitude of allochthonous input of guano that is produced by the largest bat population in the world—a colony of more than 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). Research on the guano-subsidy ecosystems dynamics of Bracken Cave is limited, but imperative to our understanding and conservation of this extraordinary ecosystem. The objectives of this study are to determine the quantity and quality of guano deposition across seasons and its effect on the macroinvertebrate community and to examine the effect of the cave’s habitat characteristics, such as distance from entrances and depth within the guano substrate, on the macroinvertebrate abundance and taxon richness at Bracken Cave. Core samples of guano and macroinvertebrates were collected at increasing distances within the cave on a monthly basis. Guano from the core samples was analyzed with respect to C, N, and P to determine guano quality variations. In addition, pitfall trap sampling was employed to supplement the macroinvertebrate core sampling. An estimated dry weight total of 50,500 kg of guano was deposited on the 3078 m2 of floor from August 2009 to August 2010, with the highest rate recorded in September 2009 and the lowest in January–March 2010. Variations in guano deposits with respect to seasonality do not have a significant effect on macroinvertebrate abundance and richness. On the other hand, habitat characteristics significantly affected the macroinvertebrate abundance and richness in the cave. Macroinvertebrate abundance decreased with increasing depth within the guano substrate. Carbon concentrations were significantly higher in the top layers of guano, while nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were not significantly different with respect to guano depth. Results from pitfall-trap sampling indicated that macroinvertebrate richness was significantly higher near cave entrances. This study indicates that the invertebrate community at Bracken Cave was relatively stable and experienced few seasonal fluctuations, but was shaped by the micro-habitat characteristics of distance from entrances and depth within the guano substrate. The bats and the nutrients that they contribute play a central role as productivity donors to the bottom-up dynamics of one of the most unusual cave ecosystems in the world.",

Stemming from a putatively insectivorous ancestor, noctilionoid bats diversified to adapt to the widest range of dietary ecologies among mammals. The high concentration of noctilionoid diversity in the Neotropics raises the question as to whether competitive ecological interactions influenced their diversification. However, patterns of morphological diversification along gradients of coexistence in Noctilionoidea are understudied. Here, we assessed the effect of dietary adaptations on patterns of morphological divergence associated with coexistence in noctilionoid bats.",

It states that, towards higher latitudes, greater seasonal climatic variability is the most important pressure that selectively promotes greater general climatic tolerance of species, and therefore also more extensive species ranges. In order to test this hypothesis, we explore the inﬂuence of climate, area and biome diversity on the latitudinal gradient of climatic specialization.",

We hypothesize that this complexity results in a high turnover in species composition among subregions.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat species in Mongolia have received a relatively low conservation priority compared to avian and other mammalian species. This might partially result from their understudied ecologies, distributions, and population sizes in Mongolia. Additionally, Mongolia hosts a relatively small assembly of bat species. In this study, we investigated the genetic characteristics of 14 species of bats (n ¼ 61) from six genera (Myotis, Vespertilio, Eptesicus, Hypsugo, Plecotus, and Murina) using a 598 bp long mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene. We reconstructed Maximum likelihood and Bayesian-inference trees, together with estimated molecular divergence times on nodes of interest using an HKY substitution model. Our ﬁndings clearly showed four distinct clades (IeIV). Through the partial fragment mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene, 26 haplotypes (Hd ¼ 0.94 Æ 0.0001) were identiﬁed overall from 61 individuals. We estimated a divergence time of 31.71e55.84 mya (95% highest posterior density (HPD)) on the node of clade I (genus Myotis) and the other three clades (other genera). Interestingly, in clade II, we no longer considered animals in haplotype 2 (H2) of Hypsugo alaschanicus as H. alaschanicus. Instead, this haplotype was recently described as H. stubbei. Additional molecular genetic studies are required to clarify intraspeciﬁc divergences of some vesper bats in Mongolia, particularly, M. ikonnikovi, M. davidii, H. alaschanicus, and P. ognevi.",

This study is the ﬁrst bat survey in this area. Nineteen species were from Mongolia. Six bat species belonged to three genera. We performed mitochondrial DNA sequencing of Myotis bombinus, Myotis gracilis, and Myotis petax to conﬁrm the morphological identiﬁcation of these species. We also determined the sound frequencies of the six bat species, based on their echolocation calls. The conservation status was determined using World Conservation Union red list categories and criteria. Sixteen bats from three species were ringed during this study and three artiﬁcial boxes were placed on trees in the Kharaa River Valley. Other than the northern bat, all species were eastern Palearctic. The northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii) species is widespread in the northern Palearctic region.",

This study aimed to determine the activity patterns and habitat use by bats in an arid environment in western Algeria (Bechar region). In 2016, six sites were studied using acoustic bat detection. A total of 10 species were reported: Asellia tridens, Rhinopoma cystops, R. microphyllum, Tadarida teniotis, Miniopterus schreibersii, Eptesicus isabellinus, Hypsugo savii, Otonycteris hemprichii, Pipistrellus kuhlii (including P. kuhlii kuhlii and P. kuhlii deserti) and Vansonia rueppellii. Activity varied considerably from month to month and from site to site. Bats were particularly active in the spring and autumn. The ﬁrst activity peak coincides with pregnancy (late April), followed by relatively low activity in August, probably due to summer torpor induced by high temperatures. The second peak in October coincides with mating and storage reserves before winter. Water bodies, oasis and urban lights concentrate bat activity. These results conﬁrm the previously reported major role of water bodies in arid environments for bats. Further surveys should be carried out in the region and conservation measures should be taken to protect known roosts.",

Evidence of wind turbine attraction and repulsion on bats, and underlying collision risks and habitats losses, are increasingly reported. Since bat activity strongly decreases with distance to optimal habitats such as woody edges, we hypothesize that the distance to these habitats could drive attraction and repulsion in the immediate vicinity of wind turbine. Although several studies have demonstrated wind turbine attraction and repulsion on bats separately, none have so far investigated the co‐existence of both in the same landscape context and evaluated the underlying safe siting distance of wind turbines to bat habitats.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We assessed how wind turbines alter bat activity in their immediate vicinity when located at different distances from hedgerows. We acoustically quantified bat activity for two guilds (short‐and long‐range echolocators) and two species/species group (\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    and\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii/nathusii\n                    from the mid‐range echolocators guild) in open areas from 10 to 283 m from hedgerows using a paired sampling design (i.e. recordings conducted simultaneously in areas with and without wind turbines). Sixty‐five pairs were sampled over 23 nights during the migration period (i.e. from late summer to late fall) in France.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Overall, in the absence of wind turbine, we found that bat activity decreased with increasing distance to hedgerows for all guilds, as widely reported in the literature. Yet, this pattern was no longer observed under wind turbine.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    When looking at specific distances to hedgerows, we found the activity of all bat groups and species (except for\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii/nathusii\n                    ) near hedgerows (10–43 m) to be drastically lower under wind turbines than without wind turbine. In contrast, the activity of short‐range echolocators was higher under wind turbines when located at 43–100 m from hedgerows, and it tended to be higher for long‐range echolocators. Lastly, no effect was detected under wind turbines located at 100–283 m from hedgerows for any guild.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . This study provides empirical evidence that wind turbines close to optimal habitats such as hedgerows strongly repel bats, while wind turbines located farther away in open areas could attract them. Increased risks of collisions and habitat losses near edges strengthen the importance of keeping wind turbines at a sufficient distance from woody edges (e.g. 200 m as recommended by EUROBATS guidelines).\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Résumé\n            \n              \n                \n                  Le développement exponentiel du secteur éolien soulève d'importants enjeux concernant ses impacts sur la faune volante. En effet, de plus en plus d'études documentent les effets d'attraction et de répulsion exercés par les éoliennes sur les chiroptères, ainsi que les risques de collision et de perte d'habitats qui en découlent. Etant donné que l'activité des chiroptères diminue fortement lorsque l'on s'éloigne d'habitats favorables tels que les lisières arborées, nous émettons l'hypothèse que l'effet local des éoliennes (attraction ou répulsion) est dépendant de la distance à ces habitats arborés. Bien que certaines études aient mis en avant les effets d'attraction ou de répulsion qu'exercent les éoliennes sur les chiroptères, aucune n'a jusqu'ici étudié la potentielle coexistence de ces effets dans un même contexte paysager ni évalué les distances minimales d'implantation des éoliennes aux habitats des chiroptères qui en résultent.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Nous avons étudié comment la présence d'éoliennes altère l'activité des chiroptères localement (au niveau de l'éolienne) à différentes distances des haies. Nous avons quantifié acoustiquement l'activité des chiroptères pour deux guildes (écholocateurs à courte et longue distance) et deux espèce/groupe d'espèces (\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    et\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii/Pipistrellus nathusii\n                    —guilde des écholocateurs à moyenne distance) en milieux ouverts de 10 à 283 m des haies en utilisant un protocole d'échantillonnage apparié (enregistrements conduits simultanément sous une éolienne et en absence d'éolienne). Soixante‐cinq paires ont été échantillonnées sur 23 nuits pendant la période de migration (entre la fin de l'été et de l'automne) en France.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Globalement, en l'absence d'éolienne, l'activité des chiroptères diminue avec l'éloignement aux haies comme largement documenté dans la littérature et ce pour les trois guildes. Cependant, cette relation disparaît en présence d'éolienne.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    En examinant des distances spécifiques à la haie, nous avons trouvé que l'activité de toutes les espèces/groupes d'espèces (excepté celle du groupe\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii/Pipistrellus nathusii\n                    ) près des haies (10–43 m) était drastiquement plus basse sous éolienne par rapport à un site sans éolienne. Au contraire, l'activité était plus élevée sous éolienne quand celle‐ci était située à 43–100 m des haies pour les écholocateurs à courte distance, et tendait (c'est‐à‐dire proche de la significativité) à l'être également pour les écholocateurs à longue distance. Finalement, aucun n'effet n'a été détecté sous éolienne située entre 100 et 283 m des haies.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Résumé et applications\n                    . Cette étude fournit des preuves empiriques que la présence d’éolienne à proximité immédiate des haies engendre une diminution nette de l’utilisation de cet habitat par les chiroptères, tandis que des éoliennes situées plus loin des haies peuvent les attirer. Les risques accrus de collisions et de perte d'habitats près des haies renforcent l'importance de placer les éoliennes à une distance suffisante des lisières boisées (par exemple, 200 m comme suggéré par les recommandations EUROBATS).",

Insectivorous bats and birds are known to feed on macadamia pest insect species, like the macadamia nut borer or the green vegetable bug. Vervet monkeys move into the orchards during the day to feed on premature macadamia nuts.

Ecosystem services by bats and birds can be promoted by the exposure of artificial roost and nest sites, but research into species‐specific preferences is needed.

However, to develop comprehensive conservation strategies and to understand the impact of forest management on biodiversity, a quantitative understanding of how different trophic groups vary over the course of succession is needed.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We classified mixed mountain forests in Central Europe into nine successional stages using airborne Li\n                    DAR\n                    . We analysed α‐ and β‐diversity of six trophic groups encompassing approximately 3,000 species from three kingdoms. We quantified the effect of successional stage on the number of species with and without controlling for species abundances and tested whether the data fit the\n                    more‐individuals\n                    hypothesis or the\n                    habitat heterogeneity\n                    hypothesis. Furthermore, we analysed the similarity of assemblages along successional development.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  The abundance of producers, first‐order consumers, and saprotrophic species showed a U‐shaped response to forest succession. The number of species of producer and consumer groups generally followed this U‐shaped pattern. In contrast to our expectation, the number of saprotrophic species did not change along succession. When we controlled for the effect of abundance, the number of producer and saproxylic beetle species increased linearly with forest succession, whereas the U‐shaped response of the number of consumer species persisted. The analysis of assemblages indicated a large contribution of succession‐mediated β‐diversity to regional γ‐diversity.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Depending on the species group, our data supported both the\n                    more‐individuals\n                    hypothesis and the\n                    habitat heterogeneity\n                    hypothesis. Our results highlight the strong influence of forest succession on biodiversity and underline the importance of controlling for successional dynamics when assessing biodiversity change in response to external drivers such as climate change. The successional stages with highest diversity (early and late successional stages) are currently strongly underrepresented in the forests of Central Europe. We thus recommend that conservation strategies aim at a more balanced representation of all successional stages.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Foreign Language Abstract\n            \n              \n                \n                  Die Sukzessionsdynamik der Wälder ‐ von der Kronenöffnung bis zur Verjüngung, Reifung und Verfall ‐ beeinflusst die Menge und Heterogenität der Ressourcen, die für Waldorganismen zur Verfügung stehen. Der Naturschutz konzentrierte sich bislang im Wesentlichen auf ausgewählte Sukzessionsstadien (z. B. späte Sukzessionsstadien). Um jedoch umfassende Erhaltungsstrategien zu entwickeln und die Auswirkungen des Waldmanagements auf die Biodiversität zu verstehen, ist ein quantitatives Verständnis darüber erforderlich, wie die Artenzahlen unterschiedlicher trophischer Gruppen im Laufe der Sukzession variieren.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    In dieser Studie wurden Bergmischwälder in Mitteleuropa anhand von luftgestütztem LiDAR in neun Sukzessionsstadien klassifiziert und die α‐ und β‐Diversität von sechs trophischen Gruppen, die etwa 3.000 Arten aus drei Königreichen umfassen, analysiert. Wir haben den Effekt des Sukzessionsstadiums auf die Artenzahlen, die Arthäufigkeiten sowie die Artenzahlen unter Berücksichtigung der Arthäufigkeiten quantifiziert und haben getestet, ob die Daten der\n                    Mehr‐Individuen‐Hypothese\n                    oder der\n                    Habitat‐Heterogenitäts‐Hypothese\n                    entsprechen. Darüber hinaus analysierten wir die Ähnlichkeit der Artengemeinschaften entlang der Sukzessionsstadien.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Die Arthäufigkeiten von Produzenten, Konsumenten erster Ordnung und saprotrophen Arten zeigte eine U‐förmige Entwicklung entlang der Sukzession. Die Artenzahlen der Produzenten‐ und Konsumentengruppen folgten im Allgemeinen diesem U‐förmigen Muster. Entgegen unserer Erwartung zeigten die Artenzahlen der saprotrophen Arten keine Veränderung entlang der Sukzession. Wurde der Effekt der Arthäufigkeiten auf die Artenzahlen berücksichtigt, stiegen die Artenzahlen der Produzenten und xylobionten Käferarten linear mit der Sukzession, während die U‐förmige Reaktion der Artenzahlen der Konsumentenarten unverändert blieb. Die Analyse der Artengemeinschaften zeigte einen großen Beitrag der β‐Diversität zwischen Flächen unterschiedlicher Sukzessionsstadien zur regionalen γ‐Diversität.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthese und Anwendungen\n                    . Abhängig von der Artengruppe unterstützen unsere Daten sowohl die Mehr‐Individuen‐Hypothese als auch die Habitat‐Heterogenitäts‐Hypothese. Unsere Ergebnisse unterstreichen den starken Einfluss der Sukzessionsdynamik von Wäldern auf die biologische Vielfalt. Dementsprechend sollten bei der Bewertung der Veränderung der Artenvielfalt als Reaktion auf externe Faktoren wie den Klimawandel potentielle sukzessionsdynamische Prozesse mit einbezogen werden. Die Sukzessionsstadien mit höchster Diversität (frühe und späte Sukzessionsstadien) sind derzeit in den Wäldern Mitteleuropas stark unterrepräsentiert. Wir empfehlen daher, dass Erhaltungsstrategien auf eine ausgewogenere Verteilung aller Sukzessionsstadien abzielen.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            \n              Depending on the species group, our data supported both the\n              more‐individuals\n              hypothesis and the\n              habitat heterogeneity\n              hypothesis. Our results highlight the strong influence of forest succession on biodiversity and underline the importance of controlling for successional dynamics when assessing biodiversity change in response to external drivers such as climate change. The successional stages with highest diversity (early and late successional stages) are currently strongly underrepresented in the forests of Central Europe.

Wildlife mortality rates, however, are affected by more than just size and spacing of turbines, varying with turbine operation, seasonal and daily weather and habitat, all of which can confound our ability to accurately measure the effect of repowering on wildlife mortality rates.\n                \n                \n                  We investigated the effect of repowering on wildlife mortality rates in a study conducted near Palm Springs, CA. We controlled for confounding effects of weather and habitat by measuring turbine‐caused wildlife mortality rates over a range of turbine sizes and spacing, all within the same time period, habitat and local weather conditions. We controlled for differences in turbine operation by standardizing mortality rate per unit energy produced.\n                \n                \n                  We found that avian and bat mortality rate was constant per unit of energy produced, across all sizes and spacings of turbines.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . In the context of repowering a wind facility, our results suggest that the relative amount of energy produced, rather than simply the size, spacing or nameplate capacity of the replacement turbines, determines the relative rate of mortality prior to and after repowering. Consequently, in a given location, newer turbines would be expected to be less harmful to wildlife only if they produced less energy than the older models they replace. The implications are far‐reaching as 18% of US and 8% of world‐wide wind power capacity will likely be considered for repowering within ~5 years.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Resumen\n            \n              \n                \n                  La reducción en la mortalidad de fauna silvestre es citada a menudo como un posible beneficio de aumentar la potencia de las instalaciones de energía eólica. Estos cambios consisten en reemplazar turbinas pequeñas, de poca capacidad y alta densidad por turbinas de mayor tamaño, potencia y separación. Sin embargo, la tasa de mortalidad de la fauna no solo es afectada par el tamaño y separación de las turbinas, sino también por la forma de operar la turbina, estación, clima diario y hábitat. Todos estos factores pueden confundir nuestra capacidad para aislar el efecto del aumento de potencia.\n                \n                \n                  En este estudio, investigamos el efecto del aumento de potencia en la mortalidad de la fauna en una instalación en Palm Springs, CA. Controlamos por el efecto del clima y hábitat midiendo la mortalidad causada por turbinas de distinto tamaño y espaciamiento siempre durante el mismo periodo de tiempo, hábitat, y condiciones climáticas. Controlamos por diferencias en la operación de las turbinas estandardizando la mortalidad por unidad de energía producida.\n                \n                \n                  La mortalidad de aves y murciélagos por unidad de energía producida fue constante para todos los tamaños y espaciamientos de las turbinas.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Síntesis y aplicación\n                    . Cuando se considera reemplazar una instalación eólica para aumentar su potencia, nuestros resultados sugieren que la cantidad relativa de energía producida, pero no el tamaño, espaciamiento o capacidad nominal de las nuevas turbinas, determina las tasas de mortalidad de la nueva instalación. Por lo tanto, en una instalación determinada, es de esperar que el impacto de las nuevas turbinas será menor solo si producen menos energía que los modelos que reemplazan. Las implicaciones de este estudio son importantes, dado que el 18% de la capacidad de energía eólica en los EEUU, y el 8% en el mundo, puede ser reemplazada por instalaciones de mayor potencia en los próximos 5 años.",

Among the light types used for street lamps, light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) are expected to become globally predominant within the next few years.\n                \n                \n                  In a large‐scale field experiment, we recorded bat activity at 46 street lights for 12 nights each and investigated how the widespread replacement of conventional illuminants by LEDs affects urban bats: we compared bat activity at municipal mercury vapour (MV) street lamps that were replaced by LEDs with control sites that were not changed.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    was the most frequently recorded species; it was 45% less active at LEDs than at MV street lamps, but the activity did not depend on illuminance level. Light type did not affect the activity of\n                    Pipistrellus nathusii\n                    ,\n                    Pipistrellus pygmaeus\n                    or bats in the\n                    Nyctalus/Eptesicus/Vespertilio\n                    (NEV) group, yet the activity of\n                    P. nathusii\n                    increased with illuminance level. Bats of the genus\n                    Myotis\n                    increased activity 4·5‐fold at LEDs compared with MV lights, but illuminance level had no effect.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Decreased activity of\n                    P. pipistrellus\n                    , which are considered light tolerant, probably paralleled insect densities around lights. Further, our results suggest that LEDs may be less repelling for light‐averse\n                    Myotis\n                    spp. than MV lights. Accordingly, the transition from conventional lighting techniques to LEDs may greatly alter the anthropogenic impact of artificial light on urban bats and might eventually affect the resilience of urban bat populations.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . At light‐emitting diodes (LEDs), the competitive advantage – the exclusive ability to forage on insect aggregations at lights – is reduced for light‐tolerant bats. Thus, the global spread of LED street lamps might lead to a more natural level of competition between light‐tolerant and light‐averse bats. This effect could be reinforced if the potential advantages of LEDs over conventional illuminants are applied in practice: choice of spectra with relatively little energy in the short wavelength range; reduced spillover by precisely directing light; dimming during low human activity times; and control by motion sensors. Yet, the potential benefits of LEDs could be negated if low costs foster an overall increase in artificial lighting.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            At light‐emitting diodes (LEDs), the competitive advantage – the exclusive ability to forage on insect aggregations at lights – is reduced for light‐tolerant bats.

Natural succession of abandoned land could counter the loss of biodiversity, but the rate of natural reforestation is slow.\n                \n                \n                  Neotropical frugivorous bats facilitate natural succession because they seem to tolerate habitat disturbance when dispersing seeds of pioneer plants. Under naturally dark conditions, bats produce a copious seed rain even in deforested habitats and connect distant forest fragments. Yet, artificial light at night may compromise bat‐mediated seed dispersal if bats avoid lit areas. This may delay or jeopardize natural forest succession in fragmented tropical landscapes.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We asked whether the foraging behaviour of Sowell's short‐tailed bats\n                    \n                      C\n                      arollia sowelli\n                    \n                    , a specialist on infructescences of pepper plants (\n                    P\n                    iperaceae), is negatively affected by artificial light at night.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  First, in a dual choice experiment with captive bats, we demonstrate that food was less often explored and consumed in the dimly illuminated than in the dark compartment, indicating that artificial light alters the foraging behaviour of fruit‐eating bats. Secondly, using observations in free‐ranging bats, we found that infructescences were less likely to be harvested when plants were illuminated by a street lamp than under natural darkness.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Natural succession of deforested areas and connectivity of remaining forest patches may suffer due to artificial light at night through a reduction in nocturnal seed disperser activity in lit areas. This could have negative impacts on biodiversity and consequent effects on land erosion, particularly in developing countries of the tropics where light pollution increases rapidly with growing economies and human populations. Mitigation requires that the use of artificial light should be limited in space, time and intensity to the minimum necessary. The effectiveness of ‘darkness corridors’ to enhance fragment connectivity and to reduce species loss should be evaluated.
