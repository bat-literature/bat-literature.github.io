To test these hypotheses we examined 44-45 morphological and 11 karyological characters of 10 plecotine species, including Otonycteris hemprichii. Character states for the hypothetical ancestor were inferred by evaluation of selected outgroup taxa: Rhogeessa tumida, Nycticeius humeralis, Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis lucifugus, M. ciliolabrum, and Miniopterus schreibersi. The most parsimonious trees, identical in topology but different in character-state optimization, were congruent with the systematic hierarchy of Plecotini suggested by the first hypothesis. Otonycteris branched off before Corynorhinus. These results strongly support separation of Corynorhinus as an independent genus and limitation of Plecotus to Palaearctic species. The two highly derived taxa, Idionycteris phyllotis and Euderma maculatum, seem to be sufficiently different from each other to be regarded as generically distinct. It is proposed that the tribe Plecotini originated in the eastern hemisphere.",

Both Rhinolophus simulator and its largest African congener, R. hildebrantii, were monotocous and monestrous, and reproduction was highly seasonal. In 3 consecutive years, R. simulator gave birth consistently later (15-20 days) than R. hildebrantii, and early embryonic development was retarded in the smaller R. simulator. Copulations occurred during June and July of the cooldry season, and both species gave birth to single offspring during separate synchronized periods of parturition at the start of the wet season. Lactation in both species coincided with the period of maximal rainfall, but the weaning period of R. hildebrantii was distinctly long.",

We also collected guano monthly from 28 bridges, April 1996–November 1997, to evaluate temporal patterns of use. Eight species of bats were observed using bridges as night roosts. Bats roosted under cast-inplace concrete bridges in larger concentrations than under other types of bridges and roosted more frequently in end chambers than in center chambers of concrete cast-in-place bridges. Greatest use occurred between 0300 and 0430 h and in June–September, although some bridges were used year-round. We observed females of all reproductive stages, males, and volant juveniles night-roosting under bridges. Our data suggest that size and thermal characteristics of bridges inﬂuence use of bridges as night roosts. Further research on use of night roosts by bats would be valuable to more fully understand the ecology of bats.",

Analyses of these data indicate that cross-sectional sampling signiﬁcantly underestimates growth rates for length of forearm, body mass, and length of epiphyseal gap. Equations based on cross-sectional samples signiﬁcantly overestimated ages of young, as compared with equations based on the longitudinal method. These results support the hypothesis that cross-sectional sampling is unreliable for deriving postnatal growth curves for free-ranging bats and emphasize the importance of using longitudinal data to derive growth rates and estimates of age during the postnatal period.",

The 2 systems provided signiﬁcantly different pictures of both numbers and characteristics (highest frequency, lowest frequency, and duration) of echolocation calls, whether recorded from free-ﬂying bats in the ﬁeld or from a stationary bat in the laboratory. Although the AnabatII detector was slightly more sensitive than the QMC S200 detector, the Racal system detected more echolocation calls than the Anabat system; the 19-dB difference in sensitivity was associated with a zero-crossing period meter in the Anabat system. Results suggest 2 recommendations. First, that analysis using zero-crossing period meters should not be used to describe echolocation behavior or calls of bats. Second, that studies of activity and use of habitat based on analysis using zero-crossing period meters should involve calibration against more sensitive bat-detecting systems.",

To determine the amount of variability in the vocal repertoire and how this variation is apportioned among geographic locations and individuals within colonies, we recorded daytime vocalizations of male S. bilineata at 4 colonies on the island of Trinidad. Using visual discrimination, we identiﬁed 21 simple syllables and 62 composite syllables produced by males on the island. Using syllable counts for each colony and a nonlinear regression model, we found that 1 colony had an estimated repertoire size much larger than the others. Using 1st syllable of a common call type, we found several acoustic characteristics that showed signiﬁcant individual variation, and 1 of those features also exhibited differences between colonies that were located in close proximity and colonies that were geographically separated. The vocal repertoire of male S. bilineata is variable, with considerable potential for information transfer.",

Radiotagged bats were used to determine the foraging patterns of both female and male bats and to locate alternate roost sites. The animals showed considerable loyalty to their primary roost sites even though the study was conducted after the nursery period had ended, when the bats would normally be dispersing for the season. Foraging patterns differed between male and female bats, with females traveling greater distances than males. Males consistently stayed close to the maternity colony both during day and night. Both sexes ﬂew in the immediate vicinity of vegetation, both when foraging and when traveling from the roost to foraging areas. Foraging activity was concentrated primarily along the edges of riparian vegetation.",

We tested the hypotheses that richer patches of food, expected in more vegetated areas, have higher bat activity levels, and that fast-ﬂying species beneﬁt most from urbanization. We compared activity of insectivorous species and relative abundance of insects in 5 habitats (large parks, small parks, illuminated open areas, residential areas, and natural forest). Sampling of bat activity and insects was conducted every 2 weeks in 12 sites per habitat during summer 2002. Measures of bat activity were based on 3,600 oneminute sequences of sound that were recorded and analyzed. The average number of taxa per site was signiﬁcantly higher in the natural forest than in urban habitats, but overall bat activity was signiﬁcantly higher in large parks and illuminated open areas than in small parks, residential areas and natural forest. Vespertilionid bats (Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis, and an unidentiﬁed species), along with Eumops perotis, occurred almost exclusively in extensive green areas (large parks or natural forest). The molossid Nyctinomops macrotis made the broadest use of the urban–natural mosaic, whereas Tadarida brasiliensis used urban sites (illuminated areas and large parks) more intensively. Insect abundance was higher in large parks and natural forest, and it was signiﬁcantly correlated with overall bat activity and with the number of taxa recorded per site. The observed patterns of habitat use and foraging can be explained by considering the ﬂight and echolocation performance of species. Although some species successfully exploited highly urbanized sites, large areas with vegetation are needed to maintain the most diverse insectivorous bat fauna in Mexico City.",

From January 2002 to January 2003, we characterized bridge roosts in the Kisatchie National Forest located in north-central Louisiana, United States. Bats, predominately Corynorhinus raﬁnesquii, Pipistrellus subﬂavus, and Eptesicus fuscus, tended to roost in the darkest portions of the bridge and in the narrowest available spaces. They also roosted closer to the abutment, farther from the side edge, and closer to the ground than predicted; however, bats were never found roosting less than 0.4 m off the ground or against the abutments. Roost sites were warmer than other parts of the bridge and this difference was greatest in warm months. The small difference in temperatures between roost sites and other portions of the bridge is not consistent with predictions that day-roosting bats would choose the coolest possible locations. Tendency of actual roost sites to be slightly warmer than potential roost sites is best explained by the correlation of temperature with distance from the edge of the bridge. Our observations are most consistent with the hypothesis that bats roosted in areas that minimized their visibility and accessibility to predators.",

            "abstractNote": "Eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) will move into leaf litter during cold bouts of winter, and because temperatures ﬂuctuate at these roosts, our 1st goal was to quantify winter arousals in response to ambient temperature (Ta). Additionally, we measured changes in metabolism and body temperature (Tb) during hibernation and arousals at various Ta. Using these data, we estimated winter energy budgets. Bats were captured during autumn of 2003 and 2004 in southwestern Missouri and kept in environmental chambers simulating natural conditions. We assessed torpor bout duration using temperature-sensitive data-loggers within environmental chambers at 158C, 108C, 58C, and 28C. Metabolic rate during torpor was assessed within metabolic chambers at 158C, 108C, 58C, 18C, and À58C. Examination of our data suggests that torpor bout duration was not affected by sex and it was inversely related to Ta down to 28C. Metabolic rate during torpor was not affected by sex but it did vary with Ta. Tb of hibernating bats approximated Ta and the difference between these was greatest at 18C. Our studies of thermal physiology provide insight of overwintering behaviors of L. borealis, which are apparently less constrained by thermal parameters than in other temperate bat species.",

Examination of data on epididymal distension in young of the year indicates that some reach sexual maturity by the year of birth, whereas others do so in their 2nd summer. Body mass and epididymal distension were positively correlated in young of the year and adults, suggesting that early sexual maturation and reproductive condition during later life are dependent on body condition. Older males tended to be heavier and in better reproductive condition than younger ones. Examination of our data suggests that physical and reproductive condition of males increase after the initial onset of fertility until 3 years of age. This late physical maturation is in line with other life-history traits characterizing long-lived bats as K-strategists among small mammals.",

We imaged jaws and skulls of 242 specimens from 20 localities within the range of both taxa, emphasizing their southwestern regional area of sympatry. Using traditional morphometric and geometric morphometric methods, values for characters taken from dentaries of both species were analyzed in detail. Both methods detected character displacement and allowed us to detect differences in jaw size and shape within both species. The morphological difference in jaw shape is more emphasized within sympatric populations of M. evotis than in M. auriculus. This may indicate that competitive selection acts more on M. evotis. At sympatric localities, M. evotis displayed a shift to a more specialized trophic state with a trophic architecture (more highly placed articular process and robust molars) likely better at capturing beetles, whereas M. auriculus may have a greater advantage for capturing soft-bodied prey such as moths. On the other hand, the articular process is located lower relative to the toothrow of the dentary in M. auriculus. Also the shape of the jaw in this species suggests a weaker bite, more shearing force, and wider gape. All shape differences in jaw morphology are emphasized in sympatry, conﬁrming active competitive interactions between these 2 species.",

The ontogenetic sample encompasses specimens that correspond to stages 16 through 22 of the phyllostomid Carollia perspicillata (late-embryonic) as well as fetal stages. Although the earlier stages of R. amplexicaudatus show little deviations in relative timing or anatomy from Carollia, later ones are increasingly different. Integumentary structures show different degrees of developmental penetrance. Derived features in embryonic stages are clearly reﬂected in adult structures such as a great enlargement of the handplate in relation to the footplate at the moment in which both are fully differentiated. We propose that patagium morphogenesis includes development of dactylopatagium by initial retention and posterior growth of interdigital tissue, coupled with digit elongation; and development of pro-, plagio-, and uropatagium in association with wing muscles unique to bats. Additionally, allometric trends in wingspan, total wing area, arm-wing area, and hand-wing area were estimated with respect to CRL. Changes in the terminology of some Carollia stages (16 and 18) are proposed to facilitate comparisons across bat species.",

We predicted that vampire bats would have carbon isotope ratios (d13C) similar to those of livestock if they select exclusively cattle. The d13C of vampire bats averaged À10.3 6 2.6& (mean 6 SD) and was almost identical to that of livestock (X\" ¼ À12.9 6 1.6&). Thus, both vampire bats and livestock are clearly members of the C4 food web. Typical rainforest mammals such as the fruit-eating bat Carollia perspicillata had a d13C of À24.4 6 0.6&, which identiﬁed them as members of the C3 food web. The stable carbon isotope signature of local vampire bats implies a high degree of preference for cattle. We suggest that the population expansion of D. rotundus is only indirectly linked to increasing host densities and is more directly related to the bats’ preference for livestock over native mammals, probably because fenced-in cattle are a more predictable resource than free-ranging natural hosts.",

Twelve bat species and 5 acoustic groups (!5 different species) were identiﬁed using bat detectors, 17 species were found during roost inspections, and 13 species were trapped using mist nets. However, mist nets yielded the highest species richness per number of individuals sampled, as demonstrated by rarefaction. Some species were always either over- or undersampled according to the sampling method used. We also evaluated 3 guilds of bats deﬁned by summer roost preferences, documenting a signiﬁcant correlation between guild and detection method; cavity-roosting bats were underrepresented when only bat detectors and mist-net surveys were used, whereas rock crevices or man-made structure and tree guilds were underrepresented when only roosts were surveyed. Different techniques should be used to assess the richness of bat communities and we recommend combining all the methods described above in future bat surveys.",

We modeled seasonal habitat selection using radiotelemetry in relation to prey availability in a heterogeneous landscape, determined seasonal diet and prey selection, and used geographic information system data to characterize the landscape surrounding 10 breeding colonies in order to assess the radiotracking results at the population level. Although R. euryale typically has been associated with woodland, our results suggest that the existence of edge habitat, created by semicluttered structures such as hedgerows and woodland edges, was a signiﬁcant factor in the choice of foraging areas by these bats. Edge habitat was associated with meadows and pastures, creating a landscape highly suited to moths, the preferred prey of R. euryale. In the study area, however, moths were evenly distributed among habitat types; therefore, distribution of moths cannot explain the preference of these bats for semicluttered habitats. The results of our study are consistent with the presumed origin of R. euryale in an edgerich ecosystem (i.e., the savannahs of northern Africa) and establish a new paradigm for how this species uses habitat. This new paradigm, which might also apply to other members of the genus in Europe, should prompt reconsideration of the presumed habitat requirements for this species, and should be incorporated into the conservation policies for the Mediterranean horseshoe bat.",

            "abstractNote": "Little is known regarding the migratory behavior of bats, due in part to their elusive nature. Recently, however, fatalities of migratory bats at some wind energy facilities across North America have provided the opportunity and impetus to study bat migration at the landscape level. Using acoustic monitoring and carcass searches, we examined variation in activity levels and fatality rates of bats across southern Alberta, Canada, to determine if bat activity and fatality are concentrated in certain areas or evenly distributed across the landscape. To investigate geographical variation in bat activity, we acoustically monitored activity from 15 July to 15 September 2006 and 2007 at 7 proposed or existing wind energy installations across southern Alberta (,155 km between the most westerly wind energy facility and the most easterly). Activity of migratory bats varied among sites, suggesting that, rather than migrating in a dispersed way across a broad area, bats concentrate along select routes. To investigate variation in bat fatality rates among wind energy installations, we compiled fatality data collected between 2001 and 2007 from 6 wind energy facilities and conducted carcass searches at 3 wind energy installations in 2006 and 2007. Fatality rates differed among the 9 sites, partly due to differences in turbine height, but also due to differences in migratory-bat activity and the interaction between bat activity and turbine height. Our results indicate that bats migrate in certain areas and that measuring migratory activity may allow wind energy facilities to be placed so as to minimize bat fatalities.",

            "abstractNote": "Biologists routinely punch the flight membranes of bats to collect tissue for molecular analyses, or to mark animals in the field, or both. The current standard is to biopsy the wing membrane (chiropatagium) because it is easy to access and is less vascularized, and thus bleeds less, than the tail membrane (uropatagium). Although flight membrane biopsies are assumed not to affect the bat’s ability to fly or capture prey, almost nothing is known about wound healing times and the optimal punch size or location for tissue excision. We measured wound healing in the wing and tail membrane of 32 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) biopsied with 2 circular punch tool sizes, and quantified the concentration of DNA extracted from the excised tissue. Our results show that tail wounds healed significantly faster than wing wounds for both 4-mm- and 8-mm-diameter biopsy wounds. We also were able to extract significantly more DNA from tail biopsies than from wing biopsies of the same size. The newly healed tissue remains unpigmented for considerable time after wound closure, and this allows identification of individuals for an extended period. We hypothesize that the increased vasculature in the uropatagium contributes to faster healing times compared to the chiropatagium. Examination of our data indicates that tissue biopsy for molecular analyses in bats should be taken from the tail membrane, although biopsies of the wing membrane are useful for marking associated with recapture programs because the wound and scar will persist longer.",

We tested the ‘‘nutrient hot spot’’ hypothesis, which suggests that colonial bats should create nutrient peaks in and around their roosts via guano deposits. We measured the mass and nitrogen content of guano deposited outside of roosts occupied by maternal colonies of 2 tree-roosting species, Myotis septentrionalis and M. sodalis. We assessed whether these measures were related to date, species, and bat abundance using least-squares regression. We then compared the expected amount of nitrogen deposited over a maternity season to the expected annual amount of nitrogen mineralized by a forest. Mass of guano deposited increased with bat abundance and corresponded to periods of parturition and lactation. Nitrogen mineralization near a large roost of bats can be 380% of that due to decay of leaf litter. Such nutrient peaks could influence patterns of forest vegetation by impacting growth of herbaceous plants and development of tree seedlings, and the magnitude of these effects should increase in nutrient-poor areas.

            "abstractNote": "The historical exclusion of fire from the longleaf pine–wiregrass (sandhills) ecosystem has resulted in a tremendous net loss of this important habitat. Prescribed fire is recognized as an essential tool for the maintenance of natural successional dynamics in this system, and its positive effects on native tree, shrub, and ground-layer plant communities are well documented. However, little is known about the influence of fire periodicity on many of the wildlife species occupying these forests. Our goal was to determine the relative degree to which a forest’s structural characteristics and insect abundance and biomass influence the activity of different ecomorphological guilds of insectivorous bats and whether either of these factors was influenced by the periodicity of prescribed fire. We conducted a 2-year echolocation-monitoring study of bats in sandhills forests experiencing 3 categories of fire periodicity: 1–2 years, 3–5 years, and .8 years. We found significant differences in tree, shrub, and ground-layer characteristics among these burn-frequency categories, but few differences in abundance or biomass of most orders of nocturnal insects. However, the biomass of Lepidoptera was greatest at sites with the longest time between burns and was positively associated with fire-dependent deciduous tree and shrub densities. Bat activity below the canopy was significantly lower in the sites with .8year burn frequencies than in either of the other treatments and was positively associated with height of canopy closure (a fire-dependent variable). Species-specific activity patterns confirmed ecomorphological predictions. Small-bodied species with low wing loadings and aspect ratios replaced larger, less-maneuverable species below the canopy at sites with .8-year burn frequencies. We provide support for the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a habitat have primacy over prey availability in habitat choice by large and fastflying species of bats. We suggest that frequency of fire is an important indirect determinant in structuring the communities of bats that forage in forests.",

Rain-forest control sites had the highest bat species diversity and richness, and contributed more to total diversity than did secondary forest. Bat diversity was similar between secondary forest patches largely enclosed by rain forest and their controls, but higher diversity, richness, and contribution to total diversity were recorded in largely enclosed patches compared to partially enclosed patches. Partially enclosed patches were dominated by 2 small, frugivorous understory bat species (Carollia sowelli and Carollia perspicillata), whereas largely enclosed patches were dominated by 2 large-bodied, canopy-dwelling, frugivorous bats (Artibeus lituratus and Artibeus jamaicensis), which primarily feed on ﬁgs, a tree species that is abundant in rain forest. Bat diversity, richness, and contribution to total diversity were positively correlated with the proportion of area with rain forest, and bat abundance was negatively correlated with canopy openness.",

To evaluate how seasonal variation in abiotic characteristics and resources affects reproductive strategies, comparison among reproductive phenologies of species that use different resources and across geographic locations is crucial. To facilitate comparisons, it is essential to employ a rigorous and consistent classiﬁcation scheme. Yet, few studies on the reproductive phenologies of bats, important seed dispersal and pollination agents in the tropics, have employed a clear or consistent classiﬁcation scheme. We employed concise criteria to classify reproductive phenologies of frugivorous (Artibeus jamaicensis, A. watsoni, Carollia castanea, C. perspicillata, and C. sowelli) and nectarivorous (Glossophaga soricina) bat species, as well as 3 feeding ensembles of phyllostomids in northeastern Costa Rica. All 6 species exhibited bimodal phenologies (2 peaks). Each of the 3 ensembles exhibited different phenologies (i.e., frugivores: bimodal; nectarivores: polymodal [3 peaks]; and gleaning animalivores: unimodal [1 peak]). Bat species that consume plant material evinced pregnancy peaks in the late dry season and middle wet season, whereas gleaning animalivores exhibited a single peak in the middle to late dry season. Examination of geographic and temporal variation in phenologies revealed that strategies of frugivorous and nectarivorous species were geographically and temporally invariant, whereas strategies of gleaning animalivores differed among geographic locations.",

Brief periods of arousal from torpor occur at regular intervals throughout hibernation, although energetically costly. Factors that increase arousal frequency, such as the recently discovered white-nose syndrome (WNS), can thereby greatly decrease survival rates of overwintering bats. Evidence increasingly suggests that evaporative water loss (EWL) may be an important driver of arousal behavior in infected bats. We examined the role that EWL could play in torpor arousals and energy expenditures by developing an individual-based energetics model using EWL as the stimulus for arousal in populations of healthy and WNS-affected little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus). Our model also examined how EWL could affect spatial distributions of healthy and infected bats within a cave throughout winter. We calculated mean torpor bout duration and survival of populations that inhabited 2 modeled caves typical of both northern and midrange hibernacula. In a northern cave, the mean torpor bout duration was 19.97 days 6 5.49 SD between arousals for healthy bats and 8.60 6 2.11 days for WNS-affected bats, accompanied by survival rates of 0.80 6 0.07 SD (healthy) and 0.04 6 0.02 (infected). In a midrange cave, the mean torpor bout duration was 20.88 6 6.22 days for healthy bats and 8.88 6 2.47 for infected bats, and survival rates were 0.98 6 0.02 (healthy) and 0.55 6 0.05 (infected). When bats clustered, survival rates increased in both healthy and diseased populations; however, slight changes in relative humidity or the rate of EWL from infected skin counteracted these advantages. We show that, by causing an increase in arousal rates, EWL could play an important role in the pathology of WNS. Additionally, populations experiencing shorter southern winters could persist longer than their northern counterparts when faced with WNS, a fact that could be critical in maintaining viable populations for WNS-vulnerable species.",

However, exceptions do occur, with documented cases of female-biased dispersal, dispersal by both sexes, and philopatry of both sexes. In this study, we examined levels of dispersal and relatedness based on analyses of the mitochondrial D-loop and 12 nuclear microsatellite markers in the woodland specialist Ussuri tube-nosed bat ( Murina ussuriensis ), a relatively widespread, yet locally rare species that is thought to be threatened by loss of its forest habitats across its range. A total of 85 individuals were captured in lowland temperate forest on the island of Yakushima and 28 individuals in montane forest in Hokkaido, Japan. In the former, haplotypes showed extreme spatial clustering among females consistent with strong philopatry, but spatial mixing among males suggesting dispersal over short distances. These findings were broadly supported by microsatellite analyses, which indicated considerable genealogical structure within sampling locations but a lack of spatial structure, again indicating that some gene flow does occur in one or both sexes. The Hokkaido data, although limited, did not show these patterns and instead suggest that differences in environmental and behavioral variables may influence movement ecology of individuals at these 2 sites and consequently fine-scale genetic structure within this species.",

When flying in the presence of other bats, some species adjust their echolocation to avoid frequency overlap with the calls of nearby conspecifics, known as a jamming avoidance response (JAR). One aspect of JAR that has not been thoroughly examined is how the spectral structure of the jamming signal impacts the jamming response. Our objective was to examine how the structural characteristics of an echolocation broadcast impact JAR in free-flying Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis . We created 4 echolocation playbacks that differed only in call shape and frequency modulation. We examined the response of bats when flying in the presence of an unchanging broadcast (static stimulus) and when the playback signal was abruptly switched as the bat approached the speaker (dynamic stimulus). Results revealed that the bandwidth of the interfering signal impacted the strength of the observed JAR, while the presence and/or length of a terminal quasi-constant frequency section in the interfering signal did not. Our results agree with laboratory studies documenting JAR in the presence of white noise, as well as field studies demonstrating extensive variability in the echolocation calls of Brazilian free-tailed bats. We relate these results to previous findings on JAR, including a recent study documenting no JAR in a bat species and suggest further experiments to tease apart the physiological limitations of JAR. Overall, this study provides additional insight into the signal processing capabilities of bats and improves our understanding of how bats are able to orient using sound in a noisy world.",

We evaluated the responses of tropical aerial-insectivorous bats to temperature, rainfall, and moonlight intensity within and among nights. Temperature positively affected the activity of two species (Cormura brevirostris and Saccopteryx bilineata). Moonlight reduced Myotis riparius activity and increased the activity of Pteronotus rubiginosus and S. leptura. Rainfall can promote an irregular activity peak during the night compared to nights without rainfall, but the bats in our study were not active for a longer time after a rainfall event. Our findings indicate that moonlight and temperature are the variables with the highest impact on the activity of tropical insectivorous bat species and that some species are sensitive to small variations in rainfall among and within nights.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            The endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) congregates in large hibernation groups in winter and travels after spring emergence to form summer maternity colonies, but information on migration behavior in this species remains limited to mostly band recovery observations. We tracked female Indiana bats in spring migration toward summer grounds using aerial radiotelemetry. Adult female Indiana bats were radiotagged in spring from 2009 through 2017, with 15 individuals successfully tracked to summer grounds and an additional 11 bats located in summer grounds via aerial telemetry after migration was complete. This resulted in the location of 17 previously unknown summer grounds for female Indiana bats, including adding Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the summer maternity range. Two of the colonies identified in this study were south of the previously known southernmost colony in Tennessee, expanding the summer maternity range for the species by 178 km. Time-stamped location fixes along the migration path provided information about nightly and overall distances traveled, duration of travel, migration speed, and weather-related influences on bat behavior. Bats traveled 164.6 ± 26.2 km (± SE) on average from hibernacula to summer grounds and were migrating for an average of 7.3 ± 1.4 calendar nights. Bats alternated between foraging and traveling throughout each night of their migration route. Nightly migration rate was 9.9 ± 0.8 km/h and bats were active on the landscape for an average of 6.1 ± 0.4 h/night. Lower nighttime temperatures and lower barometric pressure correlated with use of layover areas during a migration night. Understanding bat behavior during migration can provide pertinent information for land managers to consider in efforts to conserve potential migration corridors, foraging areas, and roosting habitats of species in decline.",
