This bat species feeds preferentially on bird blood, and there is limited information on the viruses infecting D. youngi. Hence, this study aimed to expand the knowledge about the viral diversity associated with D. youngi by sampling and pooling the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, and intestines of all animals using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of three complete and 10 nearly complete circular virus genomes were closely related to gemykrogvirus (Genomoviridae family), smacovirus (Smacoviridae family), and torque teno viruses (TTVs) (Anelloviridae family). In addition, three sequences of bat paramyxovirus were detected and found to be closely related to viruses reported in Pomona roundleaf bats and rodents. The present study provides a snapshot of the viral diversity associated with white-winged vampire bats and provides a baseline for comparison to viruses detected in future outbreaks.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: In recent years, novel hepadnaviruses, hepeviruses, hepatoviruses, and hepaciviruses have been discovered in various species of bat around the world, indicating that bats may act as natural reservoirs for these hepatitis viruses. In order to further assess the distribution of hepatitis viruses in bat populations in China, we tested the presence of these hepatitis viruses in our archived bat liver samples that originated from several bat species and various geographical regions in China.\nMethods: A total of 78 bat liver samples (involving two families, five genera, and 17 species of bat) were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers. Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses.\nResults: Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels.\nConclusions: This is the first study to report that the Chinese horseshoe bat and the Chinese whiskered bat have been found to carry novel hepadnaviruses and a novel hepevirus, respectively. The discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses. According to the latest criterion of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we hypothesize that BtHEVMd2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.",

Virus studies in Australian bats usually target the families Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae and Rhabdoviridae, with little known about their overall virome composition. We used metatranscriptomic sequencing to characterise the faecal virome of greyheaded flying foxes from three colonies in urban/suburban locations from two Australian states. We identified viruses from three mammalian-infecting (Coronaviridae, Caliciviridae, Retroviridae) and one possible mammalianinfecting (Birnaviridae) family. Of particular interest were a novel bat betacoronavirus (subgenus Nobecovirus) and a novel bat sapovirus (Caliciviridae), the first identified in Australian bats, as well as a potentially exogenous retrovirus. The novel betacoronavirus was detected in two sampling locations 1375 km apart and falls in a viral lineage likely with a long association with bats. This study highlights the utility of unbiased sequencing of faecal samples for identifying novel viruses and revealing broad-scale patterns of virus ecology and evolution.",

Based on the novel discoveries over the past several decades, the family Paramyxoviridae infecting various hosts across the world includes 4 subfamilies, 17 classiﬁed genera and 78 species now. However, no systematic surveys of bat paramyxoviruses are available from the Chinese mainland. In this study, 13,064 samples from 54 bat species were collected and a comprehensive paramyxovirus survey was conducted. We obtained 94 new genome sequences distributed across paramyxoviruses from 22 bat species in seven provinces. Bayesian phylodynamic and phylogenetic analyses showed that there were four different lineages in the Jeilongvirus genus. Based on available data, results of host and region switches showed that the bat colony was partial to interior, whereas the rodent colony was exported, and the felines and hedgehogs were most likely the intermediate hosts from Scotophilus spp. rather than rodents. Based on the evolutionary trend, genus Jeilongvirus may have originated from Mus spp. in Australia, then transmitted to bats and rodents in Africa, Asia and Europe, and ﬁnally to bats and rodents in America.",

In this report, we describe a 2-year-old female wild Cape serotine bat (Laephotis capensis) that had been caught by a domestic cat and presented with a skin mass over the chest area. Histopathological analysis of a subsequent biopsy revealed proliferating sheets of neoplastic round cells, occasionally appearing to form packets, supported by a fine, fibrovascular stroma. Marked nuclear pleomorphism was seen, as well as a high mitotic count. Immunohistochemistry displayed positive labelling for MUM1 in the neoplastic cells. The diagnosis was extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP); a neoplasm consisting of plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes. Due to a deteriorating condition, the bat was anaesthetised, and the mass was surgically removed two weeks later. However, the bat succumbed under the anaesthetic. Histopathological examination of the mass showed the same neoplastic cell population as observed in the biopsy; in addition, there was a locally extensive infiltration of neoplastic cells in the spleen and a mild presence of neoplastic cells in circulation. This is the first report of an EMP in a bat, and we compare the findings with that seen in dogs and cats.",

Our goal was to describe the diversity of bat-associated circoviruses and cirliviruses, thus, 424 bat samples from more than 80 species were collected on four continents. The samples were screened for circoviruses using PCR and the resulting amino acid sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The majority of bat strains were classified in the genus Circovirus and some strains in the genus Cyclovirus and the clades CRESS1 and CRESS3. Some strains, however, could only be classified at the taxonomic level of the order and were not classified in any of the accepted or proposed clades. In the family Circoviridae, 71 new species have been predicted. This screening of bat samples revealed a great diversity of circoviruses and cirliviruses. These studies underline the importance of the discovery and description of new cirliviruses and the need to establish new species and families in the order Cirlivirales.",

The predominant species involved were dogs (299; 91.2%) and cats (12; 3.7%). Other species included pigs (4; 1.2%), goats (4; 1.2%), monkeys (4; 1.2%), sheep (2; 0.6%), bats (2; 0.6%) and cattle (1; 0.3%). The numbers of reported cases in animals were markedly higher than those in humans except in 2013 and 2017. There was a positive but weak correlation between cases in animals and humans which could be due to lack of reporting collaboration between institutions responsible for these. Greater Accra and Ashanti Regions were identified as hotspots in the period under review, while January and August were the months with the highest peaks for cases reported. Cases reported in rainy season were significantly higher than those in dry season. Poisson regression for spatio-temporal analyses showed no statistical significance in predicting number of rabies cases (response variable) from year, month, season, region and affected species (predictor variables).\nConclusion: Rabies remained endemic in Ghana during 2010–2017 with cases reported in nearly every month of the year during this period. There was a significant seasonal pattern with higher proportion of cases reported in the rainy/wet season compared to the dry season.",

            "abstractNote": "The Erňa cave, a mass winter hibernaculum and important swarming site of the common pipistrelle, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, is located in the Slovak Karst, near the Košice urban agglomeration in eastern Slovakia. Over the past two decades, the so-called invasions of this species have been observed in buildings in Košice. This unusual behaviour occurs in late summer or autumn and it is characterized by numerous accidental or unforeseen occurrences of bats in various spaces of these houses. It has been hypothesised that these events are related to bats swarming and hibernating in the Erňa cave; however, causality has not been confirmed. We measured the relative activity of bats from the end of the breeding season through the invasions and autumn swarming prior to the onset of hibernation by recording their echolocation calls on car-based transects in order to find any spatial and temporal linkage between activity in the urban area and the swarming site. Over two years we recorded 6,253 sequences with echolocation calls of P. pipistrellus and 5,239 records of other bats along four transects totalling 7,121 km in length. Spatial pattern analysis found that the city agglomeration presented a local hotspot of the species’ activity, especially during the invasion season. Multivariate generalised additive modelling confirmed an increased density of records of P. pipistrellus between the urban area and the hibernaculum in the pre-hibernation season, whereas this pattern was not found to be consistent on the control transects near the city. Contrary to that, other bat species showed little variation in their activity between transects and seasons. The obtained results suggest that the relatively short geographical distance between the urban agglomeration and the large swarming site is likely a clue to the frequent city invasions of the species, although the role of the city as a hibernation area cannot be completely omitted.",

            "abstractNote": "A positive correlation between cave size and bat diversity has been recorded by some authors for different cave areas in South America. We analyzed published and otherwise available data from three Brazilian karst areas and phytogeography domains, including NE and SE Atlantic Forest and Cerrado (savannah-like vegetation), encompassing a wide range of cave sizes. We found no such correlation, as expected in view of previous observations by researchers and speleologists. We discuss the ecological implications of different ways to measure bat diversity, i.e. the accumulative number of species (sequential use of caves) vs. the number of species at a given occasion (species in actual cohabitation) vs. bat abundance (numbers of individuals), as well as speleological topics related to the concept of caves (based on an anthropomorphic definition, not applicable to other species), the problems of estimating topographic variables such as cave area and volume, and the value of including cave temperatures in the analyses. Multiple interacting variables may influence the composition of cave bat communities and bat species richness and abundance. The most important ones would be the density of caves in a given area (related to lithology – calcareous vs. siliciclastic caves), regional climates, and degree of preservation of epigean habitat. Cave morphology, number and size of entrances, and presence of water bodies, as well as interactions with other species, must also be considered. In conclusion, as a general statement for tropical and subtropical bats, cave size (in the human sense) by itself does not matter, except perhaps for one-off situations. Finally, a brief overview of the diversity of cave bats in Brazil is presented.",

            "abstractNote": "A study of the mammals in the riverine forests along the Jubba River in southern Somalia, was conducted between July and September 1986. Thirty-two species of mammals were recorded, although some of the mammals only use the forests seasonally. Several species were hunted in the forest, the most important being waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus Ogilby 1833, bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus Pallas 1766 and red forest duiker Cephalophus natalensis A. Smith 1834. Several species that are rare or restricted in distribution within Somalia occur in these forests, notably the bats Pipistrellus eisentrauti Hill 1968 and Nycteris parisii De Beaux 1923, leopard Panthera pardus Linnaeus 1758 and blue monkey Cercopithecus mitis Wolf 1822, as well as others whose numbers are declining, such as waterbuck and red forest duiker. The Jubba forests are therefore of considerable conservation value, particularly since they represent the largest areas of riverine forest left in Somalia. In view of the small size and rapid rate of disappearence of these forests urgent action is needed to conserve the remaining mammal populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Rapid urbanisation in Malaysia has led to an increase in anthropogenic activities, inducing degradation of the natural environment. This advocates the necessity of wildlife and resource inventories be conducted at available forested areas, promoting steady improvement in the existing conservation and management plans, especially for threatened taxa such as the small mammals. Small mammals surveys was conducted at Tasik Bera, Ulu Gombak Forest Reserve, Sungkai Wildlife Conservation Centre, Penang Island, and Wang Kelian State Park. Harp traps, mist-nets, cage traps and pitfall traps were set during the surveys. Rhinolophus affinis was the most abundant (N = 61) volant small mammal, followed by Rhinolophus lepidus (N = 27). Meanwhile, the most abundant non-volant small mammal are Leopoldamys sabanus (N = 33), followed by Maxomys rajah (N = 25), and Tupaia glis (N = 22). Two species of shrews, Suncus etruscus and Crocidura monticola were caught as singletons. The results indicated that Ulu Gombak Forest Reserve has the highest species diversity (H’ = 2.754), whereas Penang Island recorded the lowest (H’ = 2.245). The species lists of small mammals generated from the survey will be significant for various stakeholders’ conservation and monitoring plans.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are known as potential carriers of different pathogens; these animals have been identified worldwide as an important reservoir of different species of Leptospira. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in studying leptospirosis in neotropical bats in the Amazon. This region is a fertile ground for zoonotic diseases, given the intense process of deforestation, urbanization, opening of new agricultural frontiers, predatory hunting, effects of climate change, and loss of biodiversity. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of infection associated with the genetic characterization of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in bats inhabiting diverse landscapes in the southwestern region of the Amazon. To conduct the study, mist nets were installed to capture bats. Kidney samples were submitted to LipL32-polymerase chain reaction and secY gene sequencing. Our results showed that 21% of neotropical evaluated bats in Southwestern Amazon were infected with Leptospira spp. Positive animals were found in rural, urban, periurban, and control areas. Sanguinivores had the highest frequency of positives, followed by insectivores and frugivorous bats. The species of L. interrogans and a potential new Leptospira species were identified. The frequency of Leptospira in bats was not influenced by landscape type, suggesting these pathogens may not be affected by landscape changes. The findings suggest that bats may serve as potential reservoirs of Leptospira in diverse landscapes. The presence of Leptospira in bats appears to be independent of the type of land use, implying that these pathogens may not be affected by small-scale changes in the environment.",

            "abstractNote": "Climate change is one of the drivers of wildlife-borne disease emergence, as it can affect species abundance and fitness, host immunocompetence, and interactions with pathogens. To detect emerging wildlife-borne diseases, countries may implement general wildlife-disease surveillance systems. Such surveillance exists in the Netherlands. However, it is unclear how well it covers host species vulnerable to climate change and consequently disease emergence in these species. Therefore, we performed a trait-based vulnerability assessment (TVA) to quantify species vulnerability to climate change for 59 Dutch terrestrial mammals. Species’ vulnerability was estimated based on the magnitude of climatic change within the species’ distribution (exposure), the species’ potential to persist in situ (sensitivity), and the species’ ability to adjust (adaptive capacity). Using these vulnerability categories, we identified priority species at risk for disease emergence due to climate change. Subsequently, we assessed the frequency of occurrence of these priority species compared to other mammal species examined in general wildlife disease surveillance during 2008–2022. We identified 25% of the mammal species to be highly exposed, 24% to be highly sensitive, and 22% to have a low adaptive capacity. The whiskered myotis and the garden dormouse were highly vulnerable (i.e., highly exposed, highly sensitive, and low adaptive capacity), but they are rare in the Netherlands. The Western barbastelle, the pond bat, and the Daubenton’s myotis were potential adapters (highly exposed, highly sensitive, and high adaptive capacity). Species vulnerable to climate change were relatively poorly represented in current general surveillance. Our research shows a comprehensive approach that considers both exposures to climate change and ecological factors to assess vulnerability. TVAs, as presented in this study, can easily be adapted to include extra drivers and species, and we would therefore recommend surveillance institutes to consider integrating these types of assessments for evaluating and improving surveillance for wildlife-borne disease emergence.",

Since the landmark date of European settlement of Australia (1788), at least 28 of the ca. 272 Australian endemic land mammal species have been rendered extinct. Results and Discussion: Extinctions have occurred at a more or less consistent rate of one to two species per decade since the 1840s, with that rate continuing unabated. A further 55 species from that original fauna are now threatened, and an additional 42 are Near Threatened. Although many factors have contributed to these declines and extinctions, and the array of threats varies amongst individual species, the threat that has had (and is continuing to have) most detrimental impact upon terrestrial mammal species is predation by the introduced cat Felis catus and European red fox Vulpes vulpes. There has been some successful broad-scale management of the fox, but the threat posed by feral cats remains largely unabated. For the 55 species occurring in Australian marine waters, the information base is mostly too meagre to assess conservation status other than as Data Deficient. For the Australian mammal fauna generally, the current conservation management effort is insufficient, with ongoing trends for decline in many species – for example, of 49 species whose conservation status changed over the period 1992-2012, 38 had deteriorating conservation status whereas only 11 had improving status.",

            "abstractNote": "In 2021, the authors, with the assistance of speleological clubs, conducted winter surveys of bats in underground cavities of in the Ternopil part of the Middle Dnister Region. Twenty wintering shelters of different origin and size were inspected, of which ten are described for the first time. A total of 2573 individuals of 6 species were recorded. The most abundant species (92.84%) was Rhinolophus hipposideros. The most noticeable accumulations of this species were found in the caves Kryshtaleva, Vitrova, Verteba, Yuvileyna, and Ozerna. The second most abundant species was Myotis myotis. A total of 134 individuals of this species were found, which is 5.2% of the total number of recorded bats. On the third place were Myotis daubentonii (1.1%) and Plecotus auritus (0.7%), which were found in five shelters each, albeit in small numbers. The largest number of bats was found in Kryshtaleva Cave—1188 individuals belonging to 2 species. Several hundred individuals were found during the winter in the caves Verteba and Vitrova, and more than a hundred in the caves Khomach, Juvyleyna, and Ozerna. The highest species richness was recorded in the caves Ugryn, Teklivska, and Mlynky (four species in each). There have been no noticeable changes in the abundance and species composition of bats during the winter in the underground cavities of the studied region since 2019 (at the time of preliminary surveys). It is possible to trace an increase in the abundance of Rhinolophus hipposideros in Kryshtaleva Cave, of Myotis daubentonii in Ugryn Cave, and of Plecotus auritus in several shelters. This indicates that the mode of use of caves (for scientific and recreational purposes) does not prevent them from fulfilling the role of wintering shelters for this group of animals. The Ternopil part of the Middle Dnister Region is characterized by the absolute dominance of Rhinolophus hipposideros, whereas in the neighbouring Kamenets part of the region this species ranks second in abundance after Myotis myotis. Cold-tolerant species are much more common in the Kamianets-Podilskyi area. These differences are related to the different types of the most common wintering shelters in the region.",

In September 2013, the major foods were moths, ﬂies (particularly crane ﬂies), true bugs (particularly leafhoppers), and beetles (particularly leaf beetles). In 1991 few bats remained under this bridge in winter, but by 2012–2013, many of the bats remained all winter. In winter, ﬂies and moths were the dominant foods.",

            "abstractNote": "The article presents the results of regional surveys of bats in 2010–2020 in places planned for the construction of wind farms. With the use of modern ultrasonic detectors, computer programs and an electronic library of voices, 15 species were found in the Ukrainian Azov Region. Their highest diversity (11–13 species) was revealed in places of intensive migration. First of all, these are the sites Armyansk, Chaplynka, and Askania-Nova, which are located between the Dnieper valley and the Crimean Peninsula. Probably, in this area, bats migrating from the northern and north-eastern regions cross the land and join those moving along the Azov coast. The movement of a significant number of animals is noticeable in the west of the Molochna River. A relatively large variety of bats occurs near the sites Botiyevo, Orlivka, and Primorsk, located directly on the northern shore of the Sea of Azov, along which the migratory movements of bats are particularly strong. During winter, with limited research in this period, 8 species were found, whereas 13 species during spring and autumn migrations and 11 species in summer. The almost complete transformation of the steppe into agrocoenoses bordered by forest belts and irrigation canals undoubtedly affected bats in addition to global warming. In recent years, in all places of the Ukrainian Azov Region, there has been a decline in the number of the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus), and an increase in the abundance of the noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula), Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), Nathusius' pipistrelle (Pipistrellus nathusii), and parti-coloured bat (Vespertilio murinus). In all seasons, the least common species were the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii), greater noctule (Nyctalus lasiopterus), lesser noctule (Nyctalus leisleri), Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii), and western barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus).",

            "abstractNote": "Fatalities of migratory bats, many of which use low frequency (<35 kHz; LowF) echolocation calls, have become a primary environmental concern associated with wind energy development. Accordingly, strategies to improve compatibility between wind energy development and conservation of bat populations are needed. We combined results of continuous echolocation and meteorological monitoring at multiple stations to model conditions that explained presence of LowF bats at a wind energy facility in southern California. We used a site occupancy approach to model nightly LowF bat presence while accounting for variation in detection probability among echolocation detectors and heights. However, we transposed the spatial and temporal axes of the conventional detection history matrix such that occupancy represented proportion of nights, rather than monitoring points, on which LowF bats were detected. Detectors at 22 m and 52 m above ground had greater detection probabilities for LowF bats than detectors at 2 m above ground. Occupancy of LowF bats was associated with lower nightly wind speeds and higher nightly temperatures, mirroring results from other wind energy facilities. Nevertheless, we found that building separate models for each season and considering solutions with multiple covariates resulted in better ﬁtting models. We suggest that use of multiple environmental variables to predict bat presence could improve efﬁciency of turbine operational mitigations (e.g., changes to cut-in speeds) over those based solely on wind speed. Increased mitigation efﬁciencies could lead to greater use of mitigations at wind energy facilities with beneﬁts to bat populations. ß 2011 The Wildlife Society.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Reliable estimates of population trends are important for prioritizing and implementing wildlife management actions. Abundance estimates are the most informative metric of population status but are difficult and costly to achieve for rare or elusive species. For bat species that are highly mobile and nocturnal, abundance estimates are usually only possible at their roosts. Although they are relatively easy to census in individual roosts, it is often unclear whether observed trends are representative of broader populations trends. Dual‐frame sampling is useful for monitoring wildlife populations that exhibit site fidelity and are highly visible but where the proportion of the population in known sites is unknown. We adapted a dual‐frame sampling approach to estimate abundance of Townsend's big‐eared bats (\n              Corynorhinus townsendii\n              ) hibernating in a system of >800 caves at Lava Beds National Monument (LBNM) in northern California, USA, in 2013–2022. Beginning with a list of opportunistically discovered hibernacula, we expanded inference to the entire system by randomly selecting sites and stratifying survey effort according to number of bats observed during previous counts. Following 4 years of surveys, we began substituting survey‐informed estimates for some site types to improve efficiency of the monitoring effort. We estimated that a mean of 2,216 ± 112 (SE) bats hibernated at the study site annually and observed fluctuations of up to 22% around the mean population estimate and as much as 21% from the previous year. Despite annual fluctuations, we did not detect a trend in the number of hibernating bats at LBNM over the study period, underlining the challenges of detecting population trends in long‐lived species not exposed to pronounced stressors. Because our analytical approach generates reliable estimates of trend while accommodating annual variability in survey effort among years, it should be attractive to wildlife managers faced with shifting priorities and resources.",

Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags (or microchips) generally have high retention rates; however, tag loss rates for small mammals such as insectivorous bats are poorly understood. We double‐marked a population of Gould's wattled bats (Chalinolobus gouldii) with forearm bands and PIT tags (with the injection site sealed with surgical adhesive) in January and February 2020 to determine rates of subsequent tag loss over the short‐ (1–2 months) and medium‐ (13–14 months) term. Loss of PIT tags occurred in 4 (2.7%) of 146 recaptured individuals, all within 2 months of microchipping. We also recorded 1 occurrence of band loss 11 months after banding. Our study supports assertions that PIT‐tag retention rates in small mammals are high, and suggests that rates of tag loss in small bat species are low when surgical adhesive is applied. Quantifying the rate of tag loss enables this variable to be incorporated into mark‐recapture models. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.",

We used a bootstrap resampling algorithm to estimate the number of mist net surveys required to capture individuals from 9 species at both study area and site levels using data collected in a forested watershed in northwestern California, USA, during 1996–2000. The mean number of simulated surveys required to capture individual species varied with species' rarity and ranged from 1.5 to 44.9. We retrospectively evaluated strategies to reduce required survey effort by subsampling data from 1996 to 1998 and tested the strategies in the field during 1999 and 2000. Using data from 1996 to 1998, the mean number of simulated surveys required to capture 8 out of 9 species was 26.3, but a 95% probability of capture required >61 surveys. Inventory efficiency, defined as the cumulative proportion of species detected per survey effort, improved for both the study area and individual sites by conducting surveys later in summer. We realized further improvements in study area inventory efficiency by focusing on productive sites. We found that 3 surveys conducted between 1 July and 10 September at each of 4 productive sites in this 10‐km\n              2\n              study area resulted in the capture of 8 species annually. Quantitative estimation of the survey effort required to assess bat species occurrence improves the ability to plan and execute reliable, efficient inventories. Results from our study should be useful for planning inventories in nearby geographical areas and similar habitat types; further, the analytical methods we used to assess effort are broadly applicable to other survey methods and taxa.",

Although highly pathogenic to their spillover hosts, bats harbor these viruses, and a large number of other viruses, with little or no clinical signs of disease. How bats asymptomatically coexist with these viruses is unknown. In particular, little is known about bat adaptive immunity, and the presence of functional MHC molecules is mostly inferred from recently described genomes. In this study, we used an affinity purification/mass spectrometry approach to demonstrate that a bat MHC class I molecule, Ptal-N*01:01, binds antigenic peptides and associates with peptide-loading complex components. We identified several bat MHC class I–binding partners, including calnexin, calreticulin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, tapasin, TAP1, and TAP2. Additionally, endogenous peptide ligands isolated from Ptal-N*01:01 displayed a relatively broad length distribution and an unusual preference for a C-terminal proline residue. Finally, we demonstrate that this preference for C-terminal proline residues was observed in Hendra virus–derived peptides presented by Ptal-N*01:01 on the surface of infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify endogenous and viral MHC class I ligands for any bat species and, as such, provides an important avenue for monitoring and development of vaccines against major bat-borne viruses both in the reservoir and spillover hosts. Additionally, it will provide a foundation to understand the role of adaptive immunity in bat antiviral responses.",

The objective of this study was to produce MAbs from RABV isolates from insectivorous bats with an antigenic profile incompatible with the pre-established one.\nMethodology: An isolate of RABV from the species Eptesicus furinalis that showed an antigenic profile incompatible with the panel utilized was selected. Hybridomas were produced utilizing the popliteal lymph nodes of mice immunized with ribonucleoproteins purified from the isolate.\nResults: Two MAbs-producing clones were obtained, BR/IP1-3A7 and BR/IP2-4E10. Fifty-seven isolates of RABV from different species of animals and different regions of Brazil were analyzed utilizing the MAbs obtained. In the analysis of 23 RABV isolates from nonhematophagous bats, the MAbs cross-reacted with ten isolates, of which four were of the species Nyctinomops laticaudatus, one of the species Eptesicus furinalis, and five of the genus Artibeus. Of the nine isolates of non-hematophagous isolates that displayed an incompatible profile analyzed, characteristic of insectivorous bats, BR/IP1-3A7 reacted with five (55.55%) and BR/IP2-4E10 with four (44.44%).\nConclusions: The MAbs obtained were able to recognize epitopes common between the three genera, Artibeus, Eptesicus, and Nyctinomops, thereby allowing the antigenic characterization of RABV isolates in Brazil.",

In the present note, we document for the ﬁrst time a necrophagic behavior in the whip spider Paraphrynus raptator (Pocock, 1902) which was observed feeding on Otonyctomys hatti Anthony, 1932 (Rodentia: Cricetidae) and a yucatan poorwill, Nyctiphrynus yucatanicus Hartert, 1892 (Caprimulgiformes: Caprimulgidae) carrion. We made the observations inside a small chamber in an ancient Mayan temple inhabited by a group of woolly false vampire bats (Chrotopterus auritus Peters, 1856) in southeastern Mexico. Carrion consumption in P. raptator is directly related with the carnivorous feeding behavior of the C. auritus group with which they coexist.",

Understanding how this diversity evolved and developing hypotheses as to why particular patterns exist require a phylogenetic perspective, which was first outlined in the work of anatomist Kunwar Bhatnagar. With the onset of genetics and genomics, it might be assumed that the puzzling patterns observed in the morphological data have been clarified. However, there is still a widespread mismatch of genetic and morphological correlations among bat chemosensory systems. Novel genomic evidence has set up new avenues to explore that demand more evidence from anatomical structures. Here, we outline the progress that has been made in both morphological and molecular studies on the olfactory and vomeronasal systems in bats since the work of Bhatnagar. Genomic data of olfactory and vomeronasal receptors demonstrate the strong need for further morphological sampling, with a particular focus on receiving brain regions, glands, and ducts.",
