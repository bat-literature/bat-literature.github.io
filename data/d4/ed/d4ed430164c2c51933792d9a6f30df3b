Comparison between these two biogeographic systems provides an opportunity to investigate the relative role of isolation in phylogeographic patterns and to elucidate the importance of evolution and demographic history in population structure. Herein, we use a genotypeby-sequencing approach (GBS) to explore population structure within three species of mastiff bats (Molossus molossus, M. coibensis, and M. milleri), which represent different ecological histories and geographical distributions in the genus. We tested the hypotheses that oceanic straits serve as barriers to dispersal in Caribbean bats and that isolated island populations are more likely to experience genetic drift and bottlenecks in comparison with highly connected ones, thus leading to different phylogeographic patterns. We show that population structures vary according to general habitat preferences, levels of population isolation, and historical fluctuations in climate. In our dataset, mainland geographic barriers played only a small role in isolation of lineages. However, oceanic straits posed a partial barrier to the dispersal for some populations within some species (M. milleri), but do not seem to disrupt gene flow in others (M. molossus). Lineages on distant islands undergo genetic bottlenecks more frequently than island lineages closer to the mainland, which have a greater exchange of haplotypes.",

Like other bats, all genes were located on H-strand except for eight tRNA and ND6 genes. Most protein-coding genes started with an ATG codon except for ND2, ND3, and ND5, which initiated with ATA or ATT instead, and terminated with the typical stop codon (TAA/TAG) or a single T or an unexpected codon of AGG. Within the control region, 6 bp repeat (TACGCA) was appeared only nine times, much lower than other published Pteropus species. These results provided basic information for researching Pteropus vampyrus on genetics, phylogeny, and adaptive evolution.",

We examined roost use and selection by Rafinesque’s big-eared bat at the tree, stand, and landscape scales during the maternity season in pristine old-growth habitat in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina. We located 43 roosts (14 maternity, 29 solitary) through cavity searches and radio-telemetry. Maternity colonies and solitary individuals selected roosts based on similar characteristics. The best model explaining roost selection by all bats included tree and stand characteristics; landscape factors had little influence on roost use. Bats selected large diameter trees in areas with a high density of trees with cavities in the surrounding area. Most roosts (67.4%) were in water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) in semi-permanently flooded and saturated areas. Half of maternity roost cavities had upper bole openings whereas only 25.8% of solitary roosts had upper bole openings. Bats that roosted with maternity groups stayed in roosts for significantly shorter periods of time (1.3 ± 0.1 days) and used significantly more roost trees (5.0 ± 0.6 roosts) than adult males (3.8 ± 1.10 days, 2.3 ± 0.4 roosts, respectively). Maternity colony use of cavities with upper bole openings and shorter residency times suggest that predator avoidance may have been an important factor governing roosting behavior of maternity colonies in this area. Our results suggest that retention of large diameter, hollow trees in wetland areas will benefit Rafinesque’s big-eared bat individuals and maternity colonies in this area.",

Measurements were analysed by Chi-square, ANOVA, t-tests and regression to identify any relationship between the body mass index and the condition of canine and molar teeth, as well as in relation to sex and season.\nResults There was no statistically signiﬁcant relationship between a bat’s dentition state and the body mass index being used.\nConclusions In Townsville, the black ﬂying-fox appears to experience a rapid decline in dental condition over time. Despite this, there is little indication that loss of teeth results in a decline in body condition. We attribute this to the dominance of ﬂoral foods in the bats’ diet in Townsville and a lesser importance of hard fruit that requires intact dentition for consumption. Edentulousness on its own is not suﬃcient reason to euthanase black ﬂying-foxes in either Townsville or similar relatively dry localities where blossom dominates the ﬂying-fox diet.",

They have been used to investigate the physiological state and the adaptation of individuals to their habitat, changes in nutritional state of birds, body condition, the level of parasite infestation, male quality, the physical condition of nestlings, etc. In the present study we tested the role of haematological and plasma biochemistry values in burrowing parrots\n              Cyanoliseus patagonus\n              (Aves, Psittaciformes) for determining individual quality and condition. We measured triglyceride levels, plasma protein levels, plasma hue and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of nestlings and breeding adults in a colony in the north of Patagonia, Argentina. We found that plasma triglyceride levels strongly relate to changes in individual condition. Plasma levels of triglycerides were found to be strongly related to mass change, hatching order and brood size in nestlings. Levels of triglycerides were found to reflect reproductive effort in adults: males fledging larger broods had decreased levels of triglycerides. Adults with lower body condition had increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Plasma hue showed a strong relationship with an ornamental trait, the red abdominal patch of male adults, and with parameters of structural body size. Thus, we have shown that haematological and plasma biochemistry values, especially plasma levels of triglycerides, are good indicators of individual quality and condition in nestlings and breeding birds.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats of the genus Myotis cannot be identified reliably using conventional acoustic analyses. Here we use morphology of echolocation calls to discriminate between Myotis spp. This method may be used to identify unknown roosts to species level. Echolocation calls of M. daubentonii, M. mystacinus and M. nattereri, were recorded in emergence flights from roosts. Images of echolocation calls were extracted for morphological analysis performed in SHAPE, a program that transforms two-dimensional outline data into Elliptic Fourier Descriptors. Species typical call shapes were described with Mahalanobis models. Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) were applied with Mahalanobis scores of typical shape alone and with a spectral call parameter, maximum frequency. DFA achieved an overall correct classification rate of 88.9% using typical outline shapes alone. Correct classification of 100% of both M. daubentonii and M. mystacinus was achieved by both typical call outlines. For M. nattereri, 79.6% of calls were correctly classified by call morphology, but the addition of maximum frequency improved this to 96.3%. Shape analyses provide a quick and easy method of distinguishing Myotis species under field conditions and could be extended to include other species of bats that share conventional acoustic parameters.",

In this paper, the evaluation of habitat suitability of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) in the Wuling Mountains was studied. The global positioning system (GPS), remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) were used to obtain ground survey data and analyse the habitat factors driving the distribution of R. sinicus. The binary logistic regression model and the Maximum Entropy Model (MAXENT model) were used to analyse the habitat suitability of R. sinicus, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the models. The results showed that both models had high prediction accuracy, but the results of the MAXENT model were more stable than those of the binary logistic regression model when the sample size changed, indicating that the MAXENT model was the optimal method. Thena jack-knife test was used to determine the importance of the influencing factors. The results showed that the main factors influencing habitat selection were annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, the nearest distance from a settlement and vegetation fractional coverage (VFC). The suitable habitat was mainly distributed in the middle region of the study area. Marginally suitable habitat was located on the edge of suitable habitat, and unsuitable habitats were mainly distributed in the southern and northwestern regions.",

The Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus) and Yuma Myotis (Myotis yumanensis) are sympatric in parts of their range in western North America, and they overlap in morphology, making them difficult to tell apart in the hand in some areas, such as the Pacific Northwest. We compared various methods of distinguishing between M. lucifugus and M. yumanensis to genetic results, using a blind test approach to remove observer bias. Using multiple independent observers, we used external morphology and echolocation-call structure to classify bats from a maternity colony consisting of both species. Genetic analysis confirmed 13 M. lucifugus and 40 M. yumanensis. Minimum echolocation-call frequency separated 100% of M. lucifugus from M. yumanensis using a cut-off of 43 kHz. All M. lucifugus had a minimum echolocation-call frequency #42.8 kHz, whereas M. yumanensis had a minimum frequency $44.55 kHz. There was some overlap in forearm length; a cut-off of 36 mm would have correctly identified 77% of M. lucifugus and 100% of M. yumanensis to species. Criteria based on subjective assessment of fur sheen and length as well as ear color were moderately successful (90.5 and 77% success by 2 separate observers) in distinguishing between the 2 species. The use of Munsell soil color charts and multivariate statistics to classify fur and membrane color and confirm species identification was not successful. Our results suggest that mean minimum call frequency alone is sufficient for distinguishing between M. lucifugus and M. yumanensis. Use of quantitative rather than qualitative criteria eliminates observer bias and appears to be better for identifying these 2 species.",

Whilst low severity fire has positive benefits for increased insectivorous bat activity and diversity, little information is available on the impact on rainforest specialised clutter dependant species such as the Golden-tipped Bat Phoniscus papuensis. Our aims were to assess the effects of fire on occupancy of habitat across the geographic range of P. papuensis in NSW, to determine the smaller scale effects of fire on use of diurnal roosts in rainforest through radio tracking and to trial the use of artificial structures to temporarily increase roost availability in burnt habitat. We observed that widespread fire encroaching on rainforest has a negative association with occupancy by P. papuensis, with this metric ~78% lower than in unburnt forest. In burnt areas, P. papuensis preferentially used unburnt refugia for their roosting sites in suspended bird nests and the loss of these habitat structures likely contributes to the disappearance of P. papuensis from the landscape. Artificial roosts were not used in the short-term (&lt; 2 years post fire) and do not appear to be a feasible management tool. With the increasing frequency and extent of wildfires the most important factor for P. papuensis to persist in the landscape into the future is the protection of its habitat through ensuring sensitive management of large tracts of connected rainforest to help buffer against the encroachment of future mega-fires.",

In certain areas of its distribution, it is likely the only bat pollinator and seed disperser of plants, and it is currently highly endangered. However, some aspects of its ecology, diet, and pollinator role remain unknown, especially in the unique and endangered lomas ecosystem. We conducted monthly evaluations of bats and plants over 15 months in the lomas of the National Reserve of Lachay (Peru) by sampling in three different plant communities along the Guayabito gorge. We collected fecal and pollen fur samples from 16 individuals of P. genovensium and recorded the phenology of its potential plant food resources. We differentiated fecal sample components and then identified and counted all pollen morphotypes in order to estimate their frequency and abundance in the samples. We also analyzed the niche breadth. Our results showed that the dietary components of P. genovensium included nectar, pollen, fruits, and insects, and that it utilized the cacti community for feeding. Pollen of the genus Haageocereus (Cactaceae) was the most frequent and abundant resource recorded, which was available all year long; moreover, the niche breadth analysis revealed that P. genovensium has a specialized diet on the Haageocereus cactus in Lachay. Finally, we suggest that P. genovensium could serve as a pollinator for Haageocereus acranthus, Haageocereus pseudomelanostele, and Puya ferruginea (Bromeliaceae) due to the large pollen loads it carries and the specific placement of pollen on different body zones.",

            "abstractNote": "Genetic and morphometric variation was examined in eleven island populations of the horse-shoe bat, Rhinolophus afﬁnis, at the easterly end of this widespread species’ range and encompassing the Australian–Oriental biogeographic interface. Allozyme variation revealed mean heterozygosity levels within islands of 0.047, which is near the mammalian average. However, heterozygosity tended to decline from west to east as populations approached the periphery of the species’ distribution, and was lowest in those islands that were separated by the greatest sea-crossing from source populations. There is extensive between-island genetic differentiation (mean FST = 0.40) and relationships between islands are associated with their arrangement in geographical space; genetic distance is correlated with geographical distance and the genetic arrangement of islands is associated with longitude. The arrangement of islands as indicated by variation in body and skull metrics is also associated with their geographical positions, and the metric and genetic measures are themselves associated. While other taxa in the region have shown genetic-geographical concordances, R. afﬁnis is the only one that displays concordant patterns in metrical features. These patterns in biological diversity are interpreted as arising from the sequential island population structure and clines in key biogeographic gradients.",

We identified various roosts used by R. ferrumequinum within the park and investigated their microclimatic parameters (temperature, relative humidity and daily temperature excursion). We monitored roost use for one year and found it not only to be influenced by season and the microclimatic conditions of different roosts, but also by occasional stress conditions such as disturbance by predators. We also studied nightly emergence behavior, specifically we considered how this is influenced by climatic (temperature, relative humidity and evening light intensity) and demographic (presence of pups, subadults and colony size) parameters. The colony always performed a pre-emergence behavior and we found that its onset occurred earlier at higher temperatures, lower evening light intensity, in larger colonies and in the presence of pups. High temperature and low evening light intensity also resulted in a longer nightly emergence, which was also identified in larger colonies and when subadults were present. This study highlights the importance of the conservation of multiple roosts within the distribution range of R. ferrumequinum nurseries. Additionally, we demonstrated how certain climatic and demographic factors influence both pre-emergence and emergence behavior.",

The mitochondrial genome is composed 22 tRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, and two rRNA genes. Molecular phylogeny of the order Chiroptera based on the maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference trees supports the classification of R. amplexicaudatus to genus Rousettus and family Pteropodidae. Furthermore, both trees support the modern division of order Chiroptera into the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera clades.",

Radio telemetry was used to ﬁnd roosts in summer during late pregnancy and through the lactation period by tagging two common species; Daubenton’s bats Myotis daubentonii (Kuhl 1817) and soprano pipistrelles Pipistrellus pygmaeus (Leach 1825). In addition, tree roosts were searched using ultrasound detectors at three sites. A total of 35 roosts in natural crevices were found using radio telemetry and through searches with ultrasound detectors and 31 of these roosts were in hollow trees, the majority in aspens Populus tremula L. (n = 30). Some tree roosts were even used by the northern bat Eptesicus nilssonii (Keyserling & Blasius 1839) which is considered a house-dwelling species in Norway. Aspens have some qualities preferred by bats and were both warmer and safer than other hollow tree species in this study area. Bat boxes are used as maternity roosts mainly by soprano pipistrelles at these latitudes, thus at present, there is no suitable alternative to hollow trees that would satisfy all tree-dwelling bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Many mammals hibernate during winter, reducing energy expenditure via bouts of torpor. The majority of a hibernator’s energy reserves are used to fuel brief, but costly, arousals from torpor. Although arousals likely serve multiple functions, an important one is to restore water stores depleted during torpor. Many hibernating bat species require high humidity, presumably to reduce torpid water loss, but big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) appear tolerant of a wide humidity range. We tested the hypothesis that hibernating female E. fuscus use behavioural flexibility during torpor and arousals to maintain water balance and reduce energy expenditure. We predicted: (1) E. fuscus hibernating in dry conditions would exhibit more compact huddles during torpor and drink more frequently than bats in high humidity conditions; and (2) the frequency and duration of torpor bouts and arousals, and thus total loss of body mass would not differ between bats in the two environments. We housed hibernating E. fuscus in temperature- and humidity-controlled incubators at 50% or 98% relative humidity (8°C, 110 days). Bats in the dry environment maintained a more compact huddle during torpor and drank more frequently during arousals. Bats in the two environments had a similar number of arousals, but arousal duration was shorter in the dry environment. However, total loss of body mass over hibernation did not differ between treatments, indicating that the two groups used similar amounts of energy. Our results suggest that behavioural flexibility allows hibernating E. fuscus to maintain water balance and reduce energy costs across a wide range of hibernation humidities.",

            "abstractNote": "The relationship between cranial morphology and diet has long been investigated in bats. Bats of the genus Myotis include insectivorous, facultatively piscivorous, and piscivorous species. We tested the hypothesis that facultatively piscivorous (five Myotis species) and piscivorous species (M. vivesi) present cranial morphological and functional changes with respect to insectivorous taxa (16 Myotis species). Cranial shapes in skull and mandible modules were described with four geometric landmark configurations in these dietary groups. Gape capacity was measured with the stretch factors for temporal and masseter muscles. Geometric configurations from two skull and two mandible shapes were analyzed to detect differences in cranial morphology in relation to diet. Differences in cranial morphology were found between piscivorous and insectivorous species involving the mandibular process where masticatory muscles are attached. Linear regression analysis of Procrustes distances and gape capacity showed that the shape of the mandibular process region was highly correlated with the stretch factor of the masseter muscle in piscivorous and facultatively piscivorous species. These results suggest differences in cranial morphology and performance among diets but the hypothesis of gradual changes in cranial shape among diets was only accepted for the mandible and not for the skull. Myotis vivesi appears to improve mechanical advantage of masticatory muscles at lower gapes, presumably allowing more efficient chewing of slippery prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Introduction: Bats are a diverse group of mammals that have unique features allowing them to act as reservoir hosts for several zoonotic pathogens such as Leptospira. Leptospires have been classified into pathogenic, intermediate, and saprophytic groups and more recently into clades P1, P2, S1, and S2, being all the most important pathogenic species related to leptospirosis included within the P1/pathogenic clade. Leptospira has been detected from bats in several regions worldwide; however, the diversity of leptospires harboured by bats is still unknown. Aim: The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity of Leptospira spp. harboured by bats worldwide.\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted on four databases to retrieve studies in which Leptospira was detected from bats. All studies were screened to retrieve all available Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA sequences from the GenBank database and data regarding their origin. Sequences obtained were compared with each other and reference sequences of Leptospira species and analysed through phylogenetic analysis.\nResults: A total of 418 Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA sequences isolated from 55 bat species from 14 countries were retrieved from 15 selected manuscripts. From these, 417 sequences clustered within the P1/pathogenic group, and only one sequence clustered within the P2/intermediate group. Six major clades of P1/pathogenic Leptospira spp. were identified, three of them composed exclusively of sequences obtained from bats.\nConclusion: We identified that bats harbour a great genetic diversity of Leptospira spp. that form part of the P1/pathogenic clade, some of which are closely related to leptospirosis-­associated species. This finding contributes to the knowledge of the diversity of leptospires hosted by bats worldwide and reinforces the role of bats as reservoirs of P1/pathogenic Leptospira spp.",

Using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), we provide molecular evidence for Pd on four big brown bats overwintering in heated buildings in New Brunswick, Canada. Two of the affected individuals also had very mild, focal, pustular, fungal dermatitis identified microscopically. A third bat, which was qPCR Pd-negative, had similar fungal lesions. Despite determining that these fungal lesions were caused by a suspected ascomycete, the intralesional fungi were not confirmed to be Pd. These findings demonstrate that bats overwintering in heated buildings and other above-ground sites may have subclinical or preclinical WNS, or be contaminated with Pd, and could play a role in local dispersal of Pd. Our inability to determine if the ascomycetes causing pustular lesions were Pd highlights the need for ancillary diagnostic tests, such as in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry, so that Pd can be detected directly within a lesion. As the host–pathogen relationship for Pd evolves, and where bat species are exposed to the fungus under varying temperature regimes, lesions may become less stereotypic and such tests could help define these changes.",

            "abstractNote": "The Gomantong cave system, Kinabatangan, Sabah (Malaysia) hosts one of the largest bat colonies known from north Borneo. The nightly exodus of Chaerophon plicatus from this site is an economically valuable tourist attraction, and must impose significant controls on the regional ecology. Monitoring ecosystem health requires monitoring bat population size, but no quantitative assessments for the Gomantong colony are available in the literature. Traditional censusing techniques (based on packing density and roost area or on roost exodus counts) yield notoriously unreliable results. Here we have applied innovative image analysis and counting techniques to videographic, photographic and terrestrial laser scanning data obtained in July 2012. The colony exits in a consistent stream along a narrow exit trajectory. The laser scanning of the large cave entrance allowed precise measurement of bat position. Video data provided 0.02-second time resolution. Average flight speed was calculated (10.38 ± 0.85 m/sec), bat exit rate was estimated at three minute intervals (peaking at 14,000 bats/minute) and then summed over the 40 minutes of bat flight. The resultant colony size estimate of 275,625–276,939 (95% confidence interval) individuals of C. plicatus in Gomantong Caves in 2012 demonstrates that the technique is viable, provides a realistic basis for ecosystem management, and can be repeated to monitor ecosystem change. The estimated insect consumption by the colony of this size is 927 ± 191 metric tons of insects per year over an estimated 270 km2 area, a very important component in maintaining ecosystem stability in the Gomantong Forest Reserve and the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as pest control over the large agricultural tracts of the region.",

Populations at high latitudes face four challenges: a shorter active season and shorter nights during the active season (less time to accumulate fat), a longer hibernation period (larger fat store needed), and colder nights (reduced prey availability). Mating also occurs during the prehibernation period, placing time constraints for mating and fattening on northern populations. We tested the hypothesis that these factors constrain prehibernation foraging in northern populations of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831)). We measured plasma triglyceride concentration to study prehibernation fueling rates of a population near the northern range limit of the species and compared our results with previously published results from a more southern population. In contrast to bats at the lower latitude, we found consistently low concentrations of plasma triglycerides, indicating a low fuelling rate throughout the prehibernation p...",

The need for migratory stopover sites to rest and refuel, such as used by birds, has been repeatedly suggested, but not previously tested empirically in bats.\n            \n            \n              2.\n               We studied migrating silver‐haired bats (\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              ) at Long Point, ON, Canada. We used digital radio‐transmitters to track 30 bats using an array of five towers that effectively covered the entire region (\n              c.\n              20 × 40 km). We measured stopover duration and departure direction, and documented movement patterns, foraging activity and roost sites. We measured body composition on arrival using quantitative magnetic resonance and simulated long‐distance migration using observed body composition to predict migration range and rate.\n            \n            \n              3.\n               Migration occurred in two waves (late August and mid‐September). Most bats stayed 1–2 days, although two remained >2 weeks. One third of the bats foraged while at the site, many foraging opportunistically on nights when rain precluded continued migration. Bats roosted in a variety of tree species and manmade structures in natural and developed areas. Half of the bats departed across Lake Erie (minimum crossing distance\n              c.\n              38 km) while half departed along the shoreline.\n            \n            \n              4.\n               Simulations predicted a migration rate of\n              c.\n              250–275 km per day and suggest that all but one of the bats in our study carried sufficient fuel stores to reach the putative wintering area (estimated distance 1500 km) without further refuelling.\n            \n            \n              5.\n               Our results suggest that migrating bats stopover for sanctuary or short‐term rest as opposed to extended rest and refuelling as in many songbirds. Daily torpor could reduce energy costs when not in flight, minimizing the need for extended stopovers and allowing bats to potentially complete their migration at a fraction of the time and energy cost of similar sized birds.",

Stromal cells stained positively for muscle actin. No staining for vimentin was noted in either neoplastic or normal internal control tissues.

We characterized levels of genetic diversity and population structure of the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831)) in eastern Canada to infer the extent to which oceanic straits may be barriers to movement. To quantify metrics of gene ﬂow and infer movement dynamics, we genotyped 679 M. lucifugus at nine nuclear microsatellites (nDNA) and sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We found high levels of genetic diversity and little population structure, with ≈13-fold higher differentiation of mtDNA than nDNA markers, suggesting that structuring patterns largely result from female philopatry. Discriminant analysis of principle components suggested that the subtle underlying structure was not concordant with sampling site. Regional differentiation (FST, Dest, Mantel test residuals) is mostly consistent with genetic isolation by distance. However, samples from Newfoundland showed genetic differentiation over and above the effects of distance, lower levels of genetic diversity, and less genetic connectivity with other sampled regions. Despite this, oceanic straits in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence do not appear to create an impenetrable barrier to movement, therefore it may be possible for white-nose syndrome to spread to Newfoundland.",

The total haplotype and nucleotide diversity are 0.63 ± 0.055 and 0.0021 ± 0.00017, respectively which suggest that R. ferrumequinum exhibits low genetic diversity. AMOVA analysis shows that more variation of genetic differentiation is present among populations of phylogenetic groupings than within populations. Our phylogenetic results support the monophyly of R. ferrumequinum and suggest this taxon comprises three allopatric/parapatric phylogroups that are distributed in Europe-western Turkey, eastern Turkeynorthern Iran, and southern Iran. The Europe-western Turkey lineage (clade 2) split from the eastern Turkey-Iran lineage (clade 1) during the middle Pleistocene (0.8534 (ca.I)À0.6454 (ca.II) Ma). The divergence time among subclades A and B occurred during the mid-Pleistocene (0.4849 (ca.I)À0.369 (ca.II) Ma). All phylogenetic analyses also indicate that the Iranian and eastern Turkey R. ferrumequinum diverged from Europe and western Turkey R. ferrumequinum, with the mean percentage sequence differences ranging from 0.92%À0.75% between them. We infer that long-term isolation of R. ferrumequinum in spatially distinct refugia in parts of southwestern and northeastern Iran has promoted distinct phylogeographic lineages during the Pleistocene.",

Therefore, the application of geometric morphometric (GM) techniques could yield more refined and robust analyses of inter- and intraspecific variations. In this study, we generated two datasets: one with molecular delimitation data based on the barcode region (COI) and the other with cranial size and shape data using GM methods. Our aims were to investigate variations between large and small species within the genus Artibeus, as well as to explore potential factors influencing such variations. The results from species delimitation revealed molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) supporting the morphological identification. Analyses using GM techniques demonstrated significant inter- and intraspecific variations in cranial size and shape among Artibeus species. The combined outcomes suggest the absence of a significant phylogenetic signal influencing skull variation. This scenario indicates that potential historical ecological factors may have directly influenced the cranial morphology of these species, acting as significant selection forces in geographical space and generating intraspecific variations in Artibeus planirostris.",

            "abstractNote": "Microsatellites are often the marker of choice for population genetic studies at intermediate spatial and temporal scales. Developing large numbers of markers has traditionally been technically difﬁcult, and this has limited our ability to investigate evolutionary phenomena that emerge across short temporal scales. Moreover, few markers tend to successfully amplify across species boundaries. As rapid advancements in high-throughput sequencing make microsatellite development cost- and time-effective, new avenues for evolutionary, population genetic and chromosome linkage mapping research are emerging. We used a published PERL script and second-generation sequencing to rapidly and affordably develop microsatellite loci for a widespread phyllostomid bat, Artibeus lituratus, for which no markers were previously available. We used Roche FLX (Titanium) Genome Sequencing to randomly sequence  101 Mb (255 065 unique reads) of genomic DNA for A. lituratus, within which we discovered 30 100 microsatellite loci. We designed primers for 19 395 loci that contained suitable ﬂanking regions. We ordered primers for 96 loci, 90 of which produced a single PCR product in A. lituratus. We genotyped 52 loci, and 45 were polymorphic in A. lituratus. We tested cross-species ampliﬁcation for 96 loci in six additional phyllostomid species: A. planirostris, A. ﬁmbriatus, A. phaeotis, Enchisthenes hartii, Sturnira lilium, and Carollia perspicillata. Cross-species ampliﬁcation was successful for at least one species for 87 loci (A. ﬁmbriatus), and in all species, at least 66 loci were ampliﬁed. These markers will not only facilitate future work on these seven species, but also illustrate the utility of this high-throughput method for development of primers across many species simultaneously.",

            "abstractNote": "Factors affecting the foraging of mobile native fauna in highly fragmented urban landscapes have seldom been quantiﬁed at large spatial scales. We investigated factors affecting foraging by Grey-headed Flyingfoxes (Pteropus poliocephalus; ‘ﬂying-foxes’) in the greater Melbourne metropolitan area. Flying-foxes established a continuously occupied colony site in the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne in 1986, and the size of the colony has subsequently increased greatly. We used a stratiﬁed-random sampling design to examine the importance of six variables on the detection of foraging ﬂying-foxes: (i) distance from the colony site (0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 km); (ii) distance from the Yarra River (0–5 and 5–20 km); (iii) the relative tree density of the municipality; (iv) whether the site was a park or street; (v) whether there was a relatively high or low density of trees at the site; and (vi) whether food was or was not detected at the site. We surveyed 240 sites within a 30-km radius of the colony site for foraging ﬂying-foxes in both May and October 2002. The probability of detecting a foraging ﬂying-fox declined with increasing distance from the colony site, but increased with increasing tree cover, and was higher for parks compared with streets and when food was present. Flying-foxes were observed foraging in a number of plant genera that have no species that naturally occur in the Melbourne area. Flying-foxes in Melbourne thus forage on planted resources that are widely distributed within a fragmented landscape, and are an example of a positive response by a native species to the process of urbanization.",

Domestic animals are commonly implicated as reservoirs of\n              S. enterica\n              and\n              C. jejuni\n              , but both are also detected in wild animals.\n              Salmonella enterica\n              serovar Typhimurium is the most common cause of human salmonellosis in Australia; however,\n              Salmonella enterica\n              serovar Wangata is associated with sporadic human outbreaks in New South Wales and wild animals may be a potential reservoir. To determine if wild grey‐headed flying foxes (GHFF;\n              Pteropus poliocephalus\n              ) are reservoirs of\n              Salmonella\n              and\n              Campylobacter\n              , faecal samples were collected from three GHFF colonies in New South Wales and cultured for the presence of\n              Salmonella\n              and\n              Campylobacter\n              . One\n              Salmonella\n              isolate was cultured from 254 GHFF faecal samples (0.39%). Whole genome sequencing was used to genetically characterise the\n              Salmonella\n              isolate and perform phylogenetic analysis. The GHFF isolate was determined to be\n              Salmonella\n              Typhimurium ST19. The GHFF isolate carried a virulence plasmid and other virulence factors, but did not exhibit antimicrobial resistance. Phylogenetic analysis determined that the GHFF isolate was most closely related to a cluster of six isolates: four from human salmonellosis cases in Queensland and two from Australian livestock. Neither\n              Campylobacter\n              nor\n              Salmonella\n              Wangata were cultured from the 254 GHFF faecal samples. This study concluded that wild GHFF in New South Wales are not major reservoirs for\n              Salmonella\n              , and the zoonotic risks associated with\n              S. enterica\n              carriage by urban GHFF are low for the general public.",

            "abstractNote": "Mammalian sperm capacitation involves biochemical and physiological changes, such as an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i), hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane potential and sperm hyperactivation, among others. These changes provide sperm with the ability to fertilize. In the bat Corynorhinus mexicanus, there is an asynchrony between spermatogenesis and sperm storage in the male with the receptivity of the female. For instance, in C. mexicanus, spermatogenesis occurs before the reproductive season. During the reproductive period, sperm are stored in the epididymis for a few months and the testis undergoes a regression, indicating low or almost null sperm production. Therefore, it is unclear whether the elements necessary for sperm fertilization success undergo maturation or preparation during epididymis storage. Here, we characterized pH-sensitive motility hyperactivation and Ca2+ influx in sperm, regulated by alkalinization and progesterone. In addition, by electrophysiological recordings, we registered currents that were stimulated by alkalinization and inhibited by RU1968 (a CatSperspecific inhibitor), strongly suggesting that these currents were evoked via CatSper, a sperm Ca2+-specific channel indispensable for mammalian fertilization. We also found hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, such as in other mammalian species, which increased according to the month of capture, reaching the biggest hyperpolarization during the mating season. In conclusion, our results suggest that C. mexicanus sperm have functional CatSper and undergo a capacitation-like process such as in other mammals, particularly Ca2+ influx and membrane potential hyperpolarization.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Increased cattle ranching in Neotropical landscapes has led to human–wildlife conflicts that complicate the relationship between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation. We review the literature related to conflicts between livestock production and the common vampire bat\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              , specifically, the factors that influence the incidence of problems caused by bites to cattle. We summarise the strategies proposed to reduce these problems and propose actions from the perspectives of cattle management, landscape ecology and the biology of the common vampire bat. The literature shows that free‐range extensive management systems, where cattle graze in areas with forest cover, near riparian zones, caves, secondary vegetation (generally shrublands and immature trees), and vegetation fragments and edges, increase the implications and the severity of the conflict. As a result of different selection forces, the wing morphology and echolocation characteristics of the common vampire bat facilitate its movement under these landscape conditions, thus favouring a scenario of greater interaction with cattle. We propose the establishment of a ‘buffer zone’ to separate the cattle as far as possible (at least 1 km) from the elements of the landscape that are key for the movement patterns of common vampire bats in cattle ranching areas. The feeding events of this species are positively associated with host availability and landscape elements that provide habitat and connectivity, which shows that the cause of this conflict originates from the process of cattle production and the invasion of the habitat of the common vampire bat. Anti‐rabies vaccination programmes in cattle and forest–cattle separation are the most important strategies to minimise conflict and prevent rabies outbreaks.\n            \n          , \n            RESUMEN EN ESPAÑOL\n            \n              El aumento de la ganadería en paisajes neotropicales ha llevado a conflictos entre humanos y vida silvestre, que complican la relación entre la producción agropecuaria y la conservación de la biodiversidad. Revisamos la literatura relacionada con los conflictos entre la producción ganadera y el murciélago vampiro común\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              , específicamente, los factores que influyen en la incidencia de los problemas causados por las mordeduras al ganado. Resumimos las estrategias propuestas para reducir estos problemas y proponemos acciones desde las perspectivas del manejo del ganado, la ecología del paisaje y la biología del murciélago vampiro común. La literatura muestra que los sistemas de manejo extensivo, donde el ganado pasta en áreas con cobertura forestal, cerca de zonas ribereñas, cuevas, vegetación secundaria, fragmentos y bordes de vegetación, aumentan las implicaciones y la severidad del conflicto. Como resultado de diferentes fuerzas de selección, la morfología alar y las características de ecolocalización del murciélago vampiro común facilitan su movimiento en estas condiciones del paisaje, favoreciendo así un escenario de mayor interacción con el ganado. Proponemos el establecimiento de una ‘zona de amortiguamiento’ para separar el ganado lo más lejos posible (al menos 1 km) de los elementos del paisaje que son clave para el patrón de movimiento del murciélago vampiro común en áreas ganaderas. Los eventos de alimentación de esta especie se asocian positivamente con la disponibilidad de hospederos y elementos del paisaje que brindan hábitat y conectividad, lo que demuestra que la causa de este conflicto se origina en el proceso de producción ganadera y la invasión del hábitat del murciélago vampiro común. Los programas de vacunación antirrábica en el ganado bovino y la separación entre el bosque y el ganado son las estrategias más importantes para minimizar los conflictos y prevenir los brotes de rabia.",

We hypothesized that tooth wear reduces the ability to consume hard-bodied insects, such as beetles, and that older E. fuscus (those with worn canines) would thus include fewer beetles in their diet than younger individuals (those with less-worn canines) do. We examined 600 fecal pellets collected from 60 female bats captured at a single maternity colony in southeastern Alberta, Canada. The diets of two groups were similar in composition, despite considerable differences in canine wear. Diets were dominated by beetles (Coleoptera), which accounted for 30 to 40% of the identifiable food items. Younger bats included more beetles in their diet, although the difference was not statistically significant. The results suggest that older bats are still able to use their worn canines to effectively puncture hard exoskeleton, perhaps because of the angular shape of the worn teeth.",

To test the hypothesis that postemergent WNS-infected bats recover from infection with G. destructans, 30 little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) were collected in May 2009 from a WNS-affected hibernation site in New Jersey. All bats were confirmed to be infected with G. destructans using a noninvasive fungal tape method to identify the conidia of G. destructans and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The bats were then held in captivity and given supportive care for 70 days. Of the 26 bats that survived and were humanely killed after 70 days, 25 showed significant improvement in the external appearance of wing membranes, had no microscopic evidence of infection by G. destructans, and had wing tissue samples that were negative for G. destructans by PCR. A subset of the bats was treated topically at the beginning of the rehabilitation study with a dilute vinegar solution, but treatment with vinegar provided no added advantage to recovery. Provision of supportive care to homeothermic bats was sufficient for full recovery from WNS. One bat at day 70 still had both gross pathology and microscopic evidence of WNS in wing membranes and was PCR-positive for G. destructans. Dense aggregates of neutrophils surrounded the hyphae that remained in the wing membrane of this bat.",

Antibodies to arenaviruses were found in northern pygmy mice (Baiomys taylori), woodrats (Neotoma spp.), northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster), oryzomys (Oryzomys spp.), deermice (Megadontomys nelsoni and Peromyscus spp.), harvest mice (Reithrodontomys spp.), and cotton rats (Sigmodon spp.) captured in New Mexico, Texas, or Mexico. Comparison of endpoint antibody titers to Whitewater Arroyo virus and Amapar´ı virus in individual blood samples indicated that the Tacaribe complex viruses enzootic in Texas and Mexico are antigenically diverse.",

However, little is known about how these viruses interact with their natural hosts. We demonstrate a Betacoronavirus (subgenus Merbecovirus), PN-bCoV, in the intestine of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat (Pipistrellus nathusii), by combining molecular and microscopy techniques. Eighty-eight P. nathusii bat carcasses were tested for PN-bCoV RNA by RT-qPCR, of which 25 bats (28%) tested positive. PN-bCoV RNA was more often detected in samples of the intestinal tract than in other sample types. In addition, viral RNA loads were higher in intestinal samples compared to other sample types, both on average and in each individual bat. In one bat, we demonstrated Merbecovirus antigen and PN-bCoV RNA expression in intestinal epithelium and the underlying connective tissue using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. These results indicate that PN-bCoV has a tropism for the intestinal epithelium of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat, and imply that the fecal-oral route is a possible route of transmission.",

            "abstractNote": "Knowledge of the stages that compose the seminiferous epithelium cycle (SEC) and determination of the duration of spermatogenic processes are fundamental for the accurate quantiﬁcation of the dynamics of spermatogenesis. The aim of this study was to characterize the stages that compose the SEC of the bat Sturnira lilium, including evaluation of the average frequency of each of these stages throughout the year and calculation of the duration of the spermatogenic process. An ultrastructural characterization of the formation of the acrosomal cap was also performed. Testicular fragments were processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analysis as well as ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy. According to the tubular morphology method, the SEC in S. lilium is divided into eight stages, following the pattern found in other mammals. Primary spermatocytes were found at zygotene in stage 1 of the cycle. There was no variation in frequency of each of the stages over the seasons, with stage 1 being the most frequent, and stage 7 the least frequent. The duration of one seminiferous epithelium cycle was 3.45 days, and approximately 15.52 days were required for the development of sperm from spermatogonia. Ultrastructural characterization allowed the formation of the acrosomal cap in round spermatids to be monitored. In conclusion, the stages that compose the SEC in S. lilium are generally similar to those described for other mammals, but the duration of the spermatogenic process is shorter than previously recorded for mammals. The presence of primary spermatocytes at zygotene in stage 1 of the cycle is probably due to the longer duration of this stage.",

            "abstractNote": "Environmental factors can inﬂuence the reproductive rates in bats, and since morphometric information of bats testis is scarce, we aimed to compare the organization and quantiﬁcation of the intertubular components in the testes of the bat Molossus molossus, collected in different seasons. Testicular histological sections were evaluated using light and electron microscopy. The intertubular compartment occupied an average 10% of the testes, being predominately constituted of Leydig cells (LC). The percentages of the testes occupied by the intertubular compartment and by LC were signiﬁcantly higher in summer, while the other intertubular components did not vary signiﬁcantly among the seasons. As suspected under light microscopy, the ultrastructural analysis conﬁrmed the existence of multinucleated LC during winter. The increase in the nuclear percentage of LC in winter seems to have caused the decrease of the cytoplasmatic measurements in that season, as well as in the volume of LC. The highest cytoplasmatic values and volume of LC registered in the spring, summer, and fall can be related to greater activity of this cell in these seasons. The higher investment in intertubular tissue and in LC observed in summer, compared to winter; suggest an increase in the steroidogenic capacity of this bat during summer. The analyses correlating testicular morphometry and abiotic environmental factors in this study conﬁrm the inﬂuence of climatic factors on the reproduction of M. molossus. Microsc. Res.

            "abstractNote": "Recent ecological theories propose that species reach their highest abundance and genetic diversity in the center of their ecological niche and decline toward the edges. We assessed whether Lyle's ﬂying fox, Pteropus lylei, abundance and genetic diversity were correlated with niche centroid distance using an ecological niche model as a proxy for fundamental niche (NF). Alternatively, we assessed whether P. lylei abundance and genetic diversity were correlated with ﬁne-scale environmental factors as a proxy of the species’ realized niche (NR). We examined relationships between abundance and environmental factors at coarse and ﬁne scales as proxies of NF and NR, respectively. For coarse scale, ecological niche of P. lylei was modeled using all available occurrence records in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, coupled with climatic data. We conducted ﬁeld measurements of P. lylei abundance and used genetic structure data across a large portion of the species’ range. We measured Euclidean distances between abundance and genetic data and the niche centroid in environmental dimensions. Spearman’s correlation was estimated between abundance and genetic diversity vs. distance to the niche centroid. Complementarily, for the ﬁne-scale test, we measured multiple regression models between abundance and genetic diversity versus the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), local temperature, percent area of waterbodies, human density, and number of Buddhist temples. We failed to detect relationships between abundance and genetic diversity with the distance to the niche centroid in the coarse-scale model. When using the ﬁne-scale, landscape-level data, we found negative correlation between genetic diversity and number of temples. The data available were unable to support niche centroid hypothesis for the current distribution and abundances of P. lylei. We note that our failure to ﬁnd an association does not support nor reject the niche centroid hypothesis. Instead, our capacity to test the niche centroid hypothesis may be limited by our ability to use empirical data to accurately reconstruct NF from ﬁeld observations only. Future research may require physiology-based experimental approaches to explore relationships between species abundances and the niche structure.",

Furthermore, outdoor access has not been quantified in domestic animals as a risk factor with respect to latitude or parasite transmission pathway. Cats are an ideal model to test parasitic infection risk in outdoor animals because there have been many studies analysing this risk factor in this species; and there is a useful dichotomy in cat ownership between indoor-only cats and those with outdoor access. Thus, we used meta-analysis to determine whether outdoor access is a significant risk factor for parasitic infection in domestic pet cats across 19 different pathogens including many relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health, such as\n              Toxoplasma gondii\n              and\n              Toxocara cati\n              . Cats with outdoor access were 2.77 times more likely to be infected with parasites than indoor-only cats. Furthermore, absolute latitude trended towards significance such that each degree increase in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood by 4%. Thus, restricting outdoor access can reduce the risk of parasitic infection in cats and reduce the risk of zoonotic parasite transmission, spillover to sympatric wildlife and negative impacts on feline health.",

However, the effects of bats on seed germination have been scarcely addressed. Here, we evaluate effects of passage of seeds through guts of Artibeus lituratus bats on the germination of the pioneer tree Cecropia pachystachya, accounting for seed storage time and fruit maturity as covariates. To control for seed sources, we collected infructescences and offered them partially to captive bats in order to obtain seeds passed through bats and seeds unpassed from the same infructescences. We then stored in glycerol subsets of seeds of both treatments through time until the beginning of the germination experiment. Germination success responded to storage time and fruit maturation stage. Among seeds from unripe fruits, those passed through the bat guts showed higher percentage of germination than seeds unpassed, but no difference occurred between treatments for seeds from mature fruits. In addition, passage through bats positively affected germination speed, irrespective of fruit maturity. Overall results support that bats can promote germination of C. pachystachya seeds, in addition to seed dispersal.",

The new species is included in Torrestrongylus because it features a bursa of the type 3 – 2, a divided cephalic vesicle with an anterior half in the shape of an umbrella, and a posterior widened half. The new species can be distinguished from the only other congener T. torrei Pérez-Vigueras, 1935 by four key features: ﬁrst, by the absence of cervical alae in both males and females; second, by the relatively longer second half of the cephalic cap; third, by the conﬁguration of the dorsal ray, that does not have a medial terminal ray, and ﬁnally, by the structure of the spicules. This is the second species in the genus, previously known from bats of the families Phyllostomidae and Molossidae in Cuba, and now in Mexico.",

Echolocating bats have retinae dominated by rod photoreceptors and use dim light vision for navigation, and in rare cases for hunting. However, the visual detection threshold of insectivorous echolocating bats remains unknown. Here, we determined this threshold for the vespertilionid bat Myotis daubentonii. We show that for a green luminous target, M. daubentonii has a visual luminance threshold of 3.2(±0.9)×10−4 cd m−2, an intensity corresponding to the luminance of an open cloudless terrestrial habitat on a starlit night. Our results show that echolocating bats have good visual sensitivity, allowing them to see during their active periods. Together with previous results showing that M. daubentonii has poor visual acuity (∼0.6 cycles deg−1), this suggests that echolocating bats do not use vision to hunt but rather to orient themselves.",

Flowers open fully at 16h00–16h30 and most androecia drop around 01h00. Anthers dehisce at 19h30–20h00 when the stigmata are already receptive. In a series of pollination experiments, fruit was set in all treatments within 10 d. The greatest pollination success occurred after hand-crossed (76.6%), open (54.4%) and emasculation pollination (53.3%). Consistently, hand-crossed (12.2%), emasculation (8.7%) and open pollination (5.1%) yielded a substantial fruit set 2 mo after the pollination experiments. Very low pollination success in facilitated autogamy suggests that most durian trees are highly self incompatible. No mature fruit was found after insect pollination and automatic autogamy. Fruit bats, especially Eonycteris spelaea, are the major pollinators of this durian although the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) was the most frequent visitor to the ﬂowers. Bats visited durian ﬂowers at the rate of 26.1 (SD = 20.7) visits per inﬂorescence per night. Since this semi-wild durian depends on fruit bats as its pollinator, protecting fruit bat populations and their roosts is vital for the production of the durian fruit crop.",

This single observation adheres to the 3 requirements of teaching outlined by Caro and Hauser (1992). A female bat experienced with a hunting task modified her behavior in the presence of a naïve observing male, resulting in a cost of reduced food availability to the female when she was hungry, while directing the male to food resources and accelerating his learning of a foraging task. The experienced female bat altered her behavior in the presence of a naïve male by nonaggressively approaching the perched male several times before flying to a bowl of live mealworms. Within minutes, her behavior led to the initiation of the foraging task by the naïve male. In sharp contrast, 5 other bats took 4–12 nights to learn this foraging task. Audio recordings of contact calls made during the interaction show possible information transfer via acoustic signals. We hope this lone observation will stimulate research on teaching in bats.",

Road networks and energy extraction infrastructure are both spatially extensive and rapidly expanding sources of noise. We predict that predators reliant on acoustic cues for hunting are particularly sensitive to louder environments. Here we examined the foraging efﬁciency of pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) when exposed to played-back trafﬁc and gas compressor station noise in the laboratory. We show that both types of noise at each of ﬁve exposure levels (58–76 dBA, 10–640 m from source) and low-level ampliﬁer noise (35 dBA) increase the time required for bats to locate prey-generated sounds by twofold to threefold. The mechanism underlying these ﬁndings is unclear and, given the potential landscape-level habitat degradation indicated by our data, we recommend continued research into the effects of noise exposure on acoustically specialized predators.",

The intervals between element onsets were used to fit the rhythm for each individual. For echolocation call sequences, we expected rhythm frequencies around 6–24 Hz, corresponding to the wingbeat in\n              S. bilineata\n              which is strongly coupled to echolocation calls during flight. Surprisingly, we found rhythm frequencies between 6 and 24 Hz not only for echolocation sequences but also for social vocalizations, e.g. male territorial songs and pup isolation calls, which were emitted while bats were stationary. Fourier analysis of element onsets confirmed an isochronous rhythm across individuals and vocalization types. We speculate that attentional tuning to the rhythms of echolocation calls on the receivers' side might make the production of equally steady rhythmic social vocalizations beneficial.",

This concerns particularly the specific attribution of marginal populations from the Mediterranean islands and from adjacent areas of North Africa and Asia, which are morphologically intermediate between continental\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              from Europe. This study attempts to clarify this question by using four different approaches: cranial morphology, external morphology, genetics and trophic ecology. The three latter methods show unambiguously that North Africa, Malta, Sardinia and Corsica are presently inhabited by monospecific populations of\n              M. myotis\n              . In contrast, cranial morphometrics do not yield conclusive results. These results contradict all recent studies, which attribute North African and Maltese mouse‐eared bats to\n              M. blythii\n              and consider that Sardinia and Corsica harbour sympatric populations of the two species. As concerns south‐eastem populations, doubts are also expressed about the attribution of the subspecific taxon\n              omari\n              which may actually refer to\n              M. myotis\n              instead of\n              M. blythii.\n              Protein electrophoresis is presently the only absolute method available for determining\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              throughout their distribution ranges. However, species identification may be approached by relying on less sophisticated morphometrical methods as presented in this study. Species‐specific habitat specializations are probably responsible for the differences observed between the geographic distributions of\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              , as they provide a logical groundwork for a coherent model of speciation for these two bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "In active sensing, animals make motor adjustments to match sensory inputs to specialized neural circuitry. Here, we describe an active sensing system for sound level processing. The pallid bat uses downward frequencymodulated (FM) sweeps as echolocation calls for general orientation and obstacle avoidance. The bat’s auditory cortex contains a region selective for these FM sweeps (FM sweep-selective region, FMSR). We show that the vast majority of FMSR neurons are sensitive and strongly selective for relatively low levels (30-60 dB SPL). Behavioral testing shows that when a flying bat approaches a target, it reduces output call levels to keep echo levels between ϳ30 and 55 dB SPL. Thus, the pallid bat behaviorally matches echo levels to an optimized neural representation of sound levels. FMSR neurons are more selective for sound levels of FM sweeps than tones, suggesting that across-frequency integration enhances level tuning. Level-dependent timing of high-frequency sideband inhibition in the receptive field shapes increased level selectivity for FM sweeps. Together with previous studies, these data indicate that the same receptive field properties shape multiple filters (sweep direction, rate, and level) for FM sweeps, a sound common in multiple vocalizations, including human speech. The matched behavioral and neural adaptations for low-intensity echolocation in the pallid bat will facilitate foraging with reduced probability of acoustic detection by prey.",

            "abstractNote": "For a better understanding of the complex coevolutionary processes between hosts and parasites, accurate identification of the actors involved in the interaction is of fundamental importance. Blood parasites of the Order Haemosporidia, responsible for malaria, have become the focus of a broad range of studies in evolutionary biology. Interestingly, molecular-based studies on avian malaria have revealed much higher species diversity than previously inferred with morphology. Meanwhile, studies on bat haemosporidian have been largely neglected. In Europe, only one genus (Polychromophilus) and two species have been morphologically described. To evaluate the presence of potential cryptic species and parasite prevalence, we undertook a molecular characterization of Polychromophilus in temperate zone bats. We used a nested-PCR approach on the cytochrome b mitochondrial gene to detect the presence of parasites in 237 bats belonging to four different species and in the dipteran bat fly Nycteribia kolenatii, previously described as being the vector of Polychromophilus. Polychromophilus murinus was found in the four bat species and in the insect vector with prevalence ranging from 4% for Myotis myotis to 51% for M. daubentoni. By sequencing 682 bp, we then investigated the phylogenetic relationships of Polychromophilus to other published malarial lineages. Seven haplotypes were found, all very closely related, suggesting the presence of a single species in our samples. These haplotypes formed a well-defined clade together with Haemosporidia of tropical bats, revealing a worldwide distribution of this parasite mostly neglected by malarial studies since the 1980s.",

We examined variation patterns in the resting frequency (RF) of echolocation calls emitted by the intermediate leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros larvatus, on a broad geographical scale. Data mining technology and Kruskal–Wallis test both showed substantial variation with a longitudinal pattern in RF in H. larvatus among colonies, and this variation was associated with geographical distance and not body size. In addition, we found that a high degree of variability between individuals was hidden under the geographical variation. The results support an effect of random cultural drift, and challenge the prey detection hypothesis. Moreover, an acoustic difference among local island colonies may be indicative of a vocal dialect. We found that each colony of H. larvatus seems to maintain a ‘private bandwidth’, which could be used for colony identity and individual communication thus helping individuals and colonies to get a number of ﬁtness beneﬁts.",

The genome is found to be 17,470 bp in length and has a base composition of A (33.1%), G (13.6%), C (24.6%), and T (28.6%). Similar to other bats, it contains a typically conserved structure including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 1 control region (D-loop). Most of the genes are encoded on H-strand, except for the eight tRNA and ND6 genes. All protein-coding genes start with an ATG codon except for ND2, ND3 and ND5, which initiate with ATC or ATA instead, and terminate with the typical stop codon (TAA/TAG) or a single T (T– –) or an unexpected codon of AGA. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence provided here would be useful for further phylogenetic analysis and population genetic studies in M. brandtii.",

Significant differences in RF were observed among populations throughout the species range in Mainland China, and this variation was positively and significantly related to climate conditions, especially environmental humidity, but the variability was only weakly associated with geographical distance. Sex dimorphism in the RF of R. pusillus may imply that female and male might keep their frequencies within a narrow range for sex recognition. Moreover, bats adjusted resting frequency to humidity, which may imply partitioning diet by prey size or the influence of rainfall noise. The results indicate that bats adjust echolocation call frequency to adapt to environmental conditions. Therefore, environmental selection shape the diversity of echolocation call structure of R. pusillus in geographically separated populations, and conservation efforts should focus on changes in local climate and effects of environmental noise.",

Bartonella and hemotropic mycoplasmas are bacteria that parasite different mammals’ species, including humans, causing different clinical manifestations. The present work aimed investigating the occurrence and assessing the phylogenetic positioning of Bartonella spp. and Mycoplasma spp. in neotropical bats sampled from Brazil. Between December 2015 and April 2016, 325 blood and/or tissues samples were collected from 162 bats comprising 19 different species sampled in ﬁve states of Brazil. Out of 322 bat samples collected, while 17 (5·28%) were positive to quantitative PCR for Bartonella spp. based on nuoG gene, 45 samples (13·97%) were positive to cPCR assays for hemoplasmas based on 16S rRNA gene. While seven sequences were obtained for Bartonella (nuoG) (n = 3), gltA (n = 2), rpoB (n = 1), ftsZ (n = 1), ﬁve 16S rRNA sequences were obtained for hemoplasmas. In the phylogenetic analysis, the Bartonella sequences clustered with Bartonella genotypes detected in bats sampled in Latin America countries. All ﬁve hemoplasmas sequences clustered together as a monophyletic group by Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses. The present work showed the ﬁrst evidence of circulation of Bartonella spp. and hemoplasmas among bats in Brazil.",

Sixty bats of both sexes were used for this study. The tongue was excised, and the weight and various linear measurements were determined. Linear measurements were also determined on the hard palate. The gross distribution of the lingual papillae was observed to be the same in both sexes; values obtained for the weight and length of the tongue were higher in the females, although no statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed (P > 0.05). The number of ridges on the hard palate displayed sexual dimorphism. Results obtained from this study may ﬁnd application in the ﬁeld of comparative and clinical anatomy of wildlife and also in feeding physiology.",

Free association and flight were permitted, and mother‐infant pairs were identified and marked on the day of birth (day 0). Suckling associations were identified daily (n = 195) and females were never found suckling young other than their own. A series of choice experiments using young aged 0–10 days and 15–25 days indicated that females would permit only their own offspring to suckle during both early and late lactation. During early lactation, mothers actively selected their young and encouraged suckling but did not do so during late lactation. Mothers were most often indifferent to approaches by alien young but occasionally aggressively rejected them. Mothers never aggressively rejected their own young but frequently were indifferent to them. Young attempted to suckle from any mother without discrimination.",

The taxonomic status of the taxon in the Sundaic subregion remains uncertain however as the limited studies to date have been largely based on morphology. The aim of the present study was to determine the taxonomic status of subspecific forms recognized in the subregion and to evaluate phylogeographic distinctiveness between those occurring in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula using genetic, morphological and acoustic datasets. Two forms were confirmed: R. a. nesites from Borneo and R. a. superans from the peninsula. The previous recognition of a population from southernmost Sumatra as R. a. superans was not supported, however, as this form is likely R. a. affinis. Genetic divergence between these three forms is rather deep and is estimated to have occurred during the arid climatic period of the Pleistocene when suitable habitats were reduced to isolated pockets. Our results support the phylogeographic distinctiveness hypothesis as R. affinis sensu lato shows discrete affinities between Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. Discovery of new forms of R. affinis is likely with greater sampling effort throughout the region. Our study also demonstrates the importance of employing multiple datasets in taxonomic evaluations, as the use of morphological and/or acoustic datasets alone could lead to erroneous conclusions.",

The two species were sympatric only at Batang Duri, a village near rainforest.\n              \n              \n                The climate of the study area is characterized by uniformly high temperatures and rainfall, but relatively there are two seasons of more rain and two of less rain. Reproduction of both species is seasonal with continuous bimodal polyoestry. Within each species, the females are in reproductive synchrony, with young born in two distinct seasons (3–4 months each) of parturition 5–7 months apart. Each parturition is followed by postpartum oestrus. For each species, gestation spans about 5–6 or 5–7 months, with embryonic development delayed in the early stages. Births of neither species were timed to the seasons of greater rainfall or to the general season of flowering/fruiting of trees. Instead, births were centred about the two seasons of less rainfall and probably timed to the fruiting of certain species of trees, including mangoes for\n                C. brachyotis.\n              \n              \n                The weight data for\n                C. brachyotis\n                indicated a difference in diet between adult males and females. The bimodal pattern of weight increase/decrease for adult males corresponded to the bimodal cycle of ripened mangoes in Brunei. Although weight increase/decrease for adult females did not correspond to the bimodal cycle of ripened mangoes, none the less the two birthing seasons did, following shortly after or beginning at the two times of abundant ripened mangoes. Similarly, adult males and females of\n                C. minutus\n                appeared to have different diets and/or different foraging patterns.\n              \n              \n                Both sexes of\n                C. minutus\n                (and probably also of\n                C. brachyotis)\n                attain maturity at about 7 months, with females giving birth for the first time at about 12 months. Females conceive shortly upon attaining sexual maturity and are thereafter in states of essentially continuous reproduction with two young born annually (2 litters/yr, 1 neonate/birth). Relative to other fruit bats (Mickleburgh, Hutson & Racey, 1992),\n                C. minutus\n                and\n                C. brachyotis\n                have high rates of reproduction.\n              \n            \n            \n              Summary\n              \n                In summary, the reproductive cycles of\n                C. minutas\n                and\n                C. brachyotis\n                are shown in Fig. 12. Reproduction of both species is seasonal and continuous bimodal polyoestry, however, reproduction of neither species is linked to rains nor the general season of flowering/fruiting of trees.\n              \n              \n                Adult females of both species produce 2 litters/yr, 1 neonate/birth. Within each species, the females are in reproductive synchrony, with young born in two distinct seasons (3–4 months each) of parturition 5–7 months apart, centring about the two seasons of less rain, which may correspond to the fruiting of certain species of trees (e.g. mangoes for\n                C. brachyotis\n                ). Each parturition is followed by postpartum oestrus. Gestation spans about 5–6 months, with embryonic development delayed or arrested in early stages. Both sexes of\n                C. minutas\n                (and probably also\n                C. brachyotis\n                ) attain sexual maturity at about 7 months, with females giving birth the first time at about 12 months.",

The overall base composition was 31.5% A, 26.2% T, 28.3% C, and 14.0% G. A maximum-likelihood tree revealed that H. pendleburyi was grouped with Hipposideros armiger within the Hipposideridae clade, which has Rhinolophidae as a sister clade.",

            "abstractNote": "We examined feeding performance of the flea Xenopsylla ramesis on three different hosts: its natural, granivorous, rodent host, Sundevallʼs jird (Meriones crassus); the frugivorous Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus); and an insectivorous bat, Kuhlʼs pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii). Because these fleas are not known to occur on bats, we hypothesized that the fleasʼ feeding performance (i.e. feeding and digestion rates) would be higher when feeding on their natural host than on either of the bats that they do not naturally parasitize. We found that mass-specific blood-meal size of both male and female fleas was significantly lower when feeding on Kuhlʼs pipistrelles than on the other two species, but was not different in female fleas feeding on fruit bats or on jirds at all stages of digestion. However, more male fleas achieved higher levels of engorgement if they fed on Sundevallʼs jirds than if they fed on Egyptian fruit bats. The fleas digested blood of fruit bats and jirds significantly faster than blood of Kuhlʼs pipistrelle. In addition, after a single blood meal, the survival time of fleas fed on normothermic Kuhlʼs pipistrelles was significantly shorter than that of fleas fed on Sundevallʼs jirds and even lower when male fleas fed on Egyptian fruit bats. Thus, our prediction was partially supported: normothermic Kuhlʼs pipistrelles were inferior hosts for fleas compared with Sandevallʼs jirds and Egyptian fruit bats. Interestingly, the proportion of engorged fleas that fed on torpid Kuhlʼs pipistrelles was significantly higher than the proportion of the fleas that fed on normothermic individuals, indicating that becoming torpid might be a liability, rather than an effective defense against parasites.",

The mitogenome shows conserved gene content and order similar with other mammalian mitogenomes, being composed of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one control region. The majority of genes are encoded on the H-Strand except for ND6 and 8 tRNAs as found in other bat species. The field identification of Myotis bechsteinii was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using datasets comprising whole mitogenomes and COXI. This mitogenome is a resource for future studies of Myotis bats and other mammals.",

However, a wide range of other species has been implicated as reservoirs or dead-end hosts. We conducted a survey for Leptospira spp. in bats and rodents from Papua New Guinea. Kidney samples were collected from 97 pteropodid bats (five species), 37 insectivorous bats from four different families (six species) and 188 rodents (two species). Leptospires were detected in a high proportion of pteropodid bats, including Nyctimene cf. albiventer (35%), Macroglossus minimus (34%) and Rousettus amplexicaudatus (36%). Partial sequencing of the secY gene from rodent and bat leptospires showed host species clustering, with Leptospira interrogans and L. weilii detected in rodents and L. kirschneri and a potential novel species of Leptospira detected in bats. Further research is needed in Papua New Guinea and other locales in the Pacific region to gain a better understanding of the circulation dynamics of leptospires in reservoir species and the risks to public and veterinary health.",

This is the first study to assess variation in size and shape from strictly geometric terms. Both factors are assessed by statistical perspectives of distribution, overlap and relative distances. Despite its overlap, the size of the skull seems to be the most influential character for the discrimination of species, with shape playing a much smaller role. The smallest species seems to be the most distinct in shape, not only in terms of distance among centroids in morphometric space, but also in the overall trend and direction of variation. Contrary to previous studies, sexual dimorphism is not given by size but by distinct shapes of the skull. Characters such as the shape of the maxilla, previously described qualitatively as discrete with sharp boundaries, appear to be truly continuous with fuzzy borders among species. Because morphometric space is a gamut of continuous variation and overlap, the taxonomic error rate for size characters seems to be substantial for the medium-sized species (Carollia brevicauda Schinz, 1821), with approximately 30–40% of individuals erroneously assigned to a different species after a jackknifed discriminant function. This taxonomic error is higher for shape characters. Morphological, systematic and ecological consequences of the observed patterns of shape and size variation are commented within the context of previously proposed arguments and hypotheses.",

This trophic strategy has been documented in two families of bats, Pteropodidae (Old World fruit bats) and Phyllostomidae (New World leaf-nosed bats). Existing folivory hypotheses for bats suggest this behavior provides a dietary supplement of protein and other essential minerals due to a deficiency of these in a frugivorous diet. The Caatinga is a seasonally deciduous tropical dry forest where most of the vegetation is leafless and dormant during the extended dry season. Here we present the first evidence of folivory in bats from the Brazilian Caatinga, with evidence for the phyllostomid Artibeus planirostris ingesting the leaves of at least 16 species of plants. We include a bibliographic review of bat folivory in the tropics. Additionally, we propose a new hypothesis on folivory in bats for this semiarid environment.",

Here, using arrays of calibrated infrared cameras and ultrasonic microphones, we demonstrate that hoary bats (\n              Lasiurus cinereus\n              ) use previously unknown echolocation behaviours that challenge our current understanding of echolocation. We describe a novel call type (‘micro’ calls) that has three orders of magnitude less sound energy than other bat calls used in open habitats. We also document bats flying close to microphones (less than 3 m) without producing detectable echolocation calls. Acoustic modelling indicates that bats are not producing calls that exceed 70–75 dB at 0.1 m, a level that would have little or no known use for a bat flying in the open at speeds exceeding 7 m s\n              −1\n              . This indicates that hoary bats sometimes fly without echolocation. We speculate that bats reduce echolocation output to avoid eavesdropping by conspecifics during the mating season. These findings might partly explain why tens of thousands of hoary bats are killed by wind turbines each year. They also challenge the long-standing assumption that bats—model organisms for sensory specialization—are reliant on sonar for nocturnal navigation.",

Although the effect of self fertilization on seed ﬁtness in hermaphrodites has been considered theoretically, this effect is far from intuitive, because it can either increase the relative seed ﬁtness of the females (if it leads hermaphrodites to produce inbred, low quality offspring) or decrease it (if it provides reproductive assurance to hermaphrodites). Hence, empirical investigation is needed to document whether relative seed ﬁtness varies with whether pollen is or is not limiting to seed production. In the current study, we measured fruit set and seed production in both females and hermaphrodites and the selﬁng rate in hermaphrodites in two experimental patches that differed in sex ratios in the gynodioecious plant Silene nutans. We found an impact of plant gender, patch, and their interaction, with females suffering from stronger pollen limitation when locally frequent. In the most pollen-limited situation, the selﬁng rate of hermaphrodites increased and provided hermaphrodites with a type of reproductive assurance that is not available to females. By integrating both the beneﬁcial (reproductive assurance) and costly effects (through inbreeding depression) of self-pollination, we showed that whether females did or did not exhibit higher seed ﬁtness depended on the degree of pollen limitation on seed production.",

Therefore, the primary aim of this prospective, exploratory study was to examine whether a systematic cardiac ultrasound protocol is feasible in this critically endangered species and to report basic measures of cardiac structure and function from a cohort of apparently healthy bats. A secondary aim was to test the effect posture (dorsal recumbency vs. roosting) has upon cardiac function in this species. Transthoracic echocardiograms, including 2D, Doppler, and tissue Doppler measures of cardiac structure and function were completed as part of routine health examinations for bats at a single center (n = 19). Bats were then grouped by age and disease status and the mean and range data reported for each group. In healthy adult bats, with the exception of a reduction in heart rate (P ≤ 0.05), right atrial systolic area (P ≤ 0.05), and right ventricular velocity during atrial contraction, there were no signiﬁcant changes in cardiac structure or function in response to the roosting position. However, in the bats presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy the current data suggest that left ventricular ejection fraction is improved while roosting. Further work is required to conﬁrm our initial ﬁndings, generate diagnostic reference intervals, and explore the causes of dilated cardiomyopathy in this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasitic protozoan that infects a diversity of hosts constituting the cycle of enzootic transmission in wild environments and causing disease in humans (Chagas disease) and domestic animals. Wild mammals constitute natural reservoirs of this parasite, which is transmitted by hematophagous kissing bugs of the family Reduviidae. T. cruzi is genetically subdivided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), T. cruzi (Tc)I to TcVI. In Brazil, especially in the state of Parana´, TcI and TcII are widely distributed. However, TcII is less frequently found in wild reservoirs and triatomine, and more frequently found in patients. The goal of this study was to investigate the natural occurrence of T. cruzi in wild synanthropic mammals captured in urban forest fragments of the Atlantic Forest of Parana´, southern Brazil. In this way, 12 opossums and 35 bats belonging to ﬁve species were captured in urban forest parks of the city of Maringa´, Parana´, an area considered endemic for Chagas disease. PCR-kinetoplast DNA molecular diagnostic reveals Trypanosoma sp. infection in 12 (100%) Didelphis albiventris and 10 (40%) Artibeus lituratus. In addition to demonstrating the presence of Trypanosoma in the two groups of mammals studied, we obtained an isolate of the parasite genotyped as TcII by ampliﬁcation of the cytochrome oxidase II gene by PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism with AluI, and conﬁrmed by PCR of rDNA 24Sa. This is the ﬁrst record of the encounter in wild mammals of Trypanosoma DNA (in A. lituratus) and T. cruzi DTU TcII (in D. albiventris) in the state of Parana´.",

Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Methods:\n              Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of\n              Cayaponia\n              and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Key results:\n              The phylogeny shows that\n              Cayaponia\n              is monophyletic as long as\n              Selysia\n              (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of\n              C. africana\n              form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2–5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that\n              Cayaponia\n              originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Conclusions: Cayaponia\n              provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa.",

            "abstractNote": "Variations in environmental conditions along gradients play an important role in species distribution through environmental filtering of morphological and physiological traits; however, their effects on bat diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of the distance to the nearest watercourse, terrain elevation, vegetation clutter, basal area and canopy height on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and on the predominance of some functional traits (body mass, wing morphology and trophic level) of bat assemblages (phyllostomid and mormoopid bats) in a terra firme forest, in the northeastern Brazilian Amazon. We captured bats using mist nets in 15 permanent plots over a 25 km2 area of continuous forest. We captured 279 individuals belonging to 28 species with a total of 77.760 m2.h of sampling effort. Our results showed that bat richness increases as a function of distance to the nearest watercourse and that the assemblage also changes, with more diverse taxonomic and functional groups in areas further from the watercourse. Furthermore, elevation positively affects species richness, and the basal area of the forest positively influences the average body mass of bats. Taken together, our results demonstrate that subtle variations in the environmental conditions along a local scale gradient impact on the main dimensions of bat diversity in primary forests.",

Such descriptions usually lack observations on social behaviour including interactions between bats with aberrant pigmentation and other individuals. Here, we report the ﬁrst observation of leucism in the greater sac-winged bat Saccopteryx bilineata. Over the course of six weeks, we were able to follow the development of a wild pup with a conspicuous aberrant pigmentation, by observing it in its day roost. Our observations indicate that the vocal and behavioural development of the pup was entirely normal, as well as the integration into its social group. After six weeks, when the pup was already foraging individually, it did not return to its colony in the morning, indicating that it may have been preyed on.",

We report the occurrence of Nyctinomops aurispinosus in Central America based on a recently dead male found in southern Honduras. The nearest localities where it has been reported are western Sonora and eastern Tamaulipas, México. The specimen was found at 1,239 masl on December 5th, 2014 in a disturbed oak-pine forest used for cattle ranching with some human infrastructure recently built in the site. We have registered several other species of bats in this study site, including N. laticaudatus, Eumops underwoodi, four vespertilionids and three mormoopids, most of them difficult to catch by mist nets. We add a new bat species to the Honduras list which now stands at 108 species.",

Here, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of evidence of Leptospira sp. infection in bats by examining studies published between 1964 and 2021. We reported the frequencies of various species and serogroups on all continents, several species and feeding habits of bats, and different diagnostic tools. Together, 33 papers from all continents with seven to 2077 individuals from one to 31 species were included. Molecular detection was conducted in most studies, followed by MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test) and isolation and identification. Molecular characterization of Leptospira sp. revealed L. borgpetersenii as the most frequent species. Moreover, 179 positive samples for MAT contained the most likely infecting serogroups described, particularly the Australis serogroup. The percentage of positive tests in isolation and identification ranged between 0% and 0.5%. The highest frequency of Leptospira infection among the continents was observed in Asia, whereas South America had the lowest percentage. Finally, Nycteridae and Rhinonycteridae were the most frequently infected bat families. Our study provides valuable information about the epidemiology of Leptospira sp. infection in bats.",

In an attempt to address some of the conservation challenges faced by this species, we studied the genetic structure and dispersal of intra‐ and interisland populations using six species‐specific microsatellite markers. In particular, we sought to establish the relationship between island populations and to define effective management units for conservation. Pairwise co‐ancestry index (\n              F\n              ST\n              ) analysis, analysis of molecular variance, and Bayesian clustering suggested the presence of significant genetic differentiation between islands but little differentiation within them. The small Yonaguni Island population appeared to be not only geographically isolated, but also genetically isolated. This population is at the greatest risk of extinction, considering its size and low genetic variation. The larger populations on Iriomote and Ishigaki Islands are genetically related to each other to a greater degree and exhibit higher genetic variation than the Yonaguni Island population. This suggests that these two island populations should be included in a single management unit, while bats from Yonaguni Island should be managed independently and given higher priority for conservation. Actions such as defining vegetation corridors between colonies, as well as building gates at the entrance of the largest known colony, should be included in the conservation agenda of this still poorly known species.",

Because bats often occupy perennial day-roosts, they might adapt their responsiveness according to the social relevance in which distress calls are broadcast. Specifically, we hypothesized that conspecific distress calls broadcast within or in proximity to the day-roost would elicit a stronger responsiveness than distress calls broadcast at a foraging site. We analysed the distress calls and conducted playback experiments with the greater sac-winged bat,\n              Saccopteryx bilineata\n              , which occupies perennial day-roosts with a stable social group composition.\n              S. bilineata\n              reacted significantly differently depending on the playback's location. Bats were attracted to distress call playbacks within the day-roost and in proximity to it, but showed no obvious response to distress call playbacks at a foraging site. Hence, the bats adapted their responsiveness towards distress calls depending on the social relevance in which distress calls were broadcast. Distress calls within or in proximity to the day-roost are probably perceived as a greater threat and thus have a higher behavioural relevance than distress calls at foraging sites, either because bats want to assess the predation risk or because they engage in mobbing behaviour.",

The signal transduction pathways and transcription factors involved in regulating hibernation‐responsive gene expression are of great interest. The present study suggests an important role for the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (p38\n              MAPK\n              ) and selected downstream transcription factors under its control (CREB, ATF‐2, Elk‐1) in the metabolic response by skeletal muscle during hibernation of little brown bats,\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              . Western blotting was used to quantify both total protein and levels of the phosphorylated, active forms of p38\n              MAPK\n              , CREB, ATF‐2 and Elk‐1 in both skeletal muscle and heart of euthermic and hibernating bats. The p38\n              MAPK\n              pathway was not apparently activated in heart during torpor but skeletal muscle showed strong increases (2.2–11‐fold) in the amounts of phosphorylated p38\n              T180/Y182\n              , CREB\n              S133\n              , ATF‐\n              2T69/71\n              and Elk‐1\n              S383\n              in the torpid versus aroused state. By contrast both total and phosphorylated levels of Elk‐1 in heart were reduced during hibernation to just 30% of the euthermic values. These data implicate p38\n              MAPK\n              and its transcription factor targets, CREB, ATF‐2 and Elk‐1 in skeletal muscle maintenance during hibernation.

Evidence-based approaches are critical to determining whether ex situ approaches will be effective, but in many cases biological and ecological data from threatened populations are scarce. We generated a structured set of general biological and social/logistical criteria required for captive management to beneﬁt threatened, free-ranging populations. We illustrate how these criteria can be applied using a case study where populations are severely threatened, but demographic data are scarce (white-nose syndrome in Canadian bats). Using (1) population viability modelling (PVA), (2) a survey of Canadian zoos and wildlife rehabilitators, and (3) literature reviews, we identiﬁed two of our ﬁve initial target species as potential candidates for captive management. PVA revealed that sustainable captive colonies require high adult survivorship relative to free-ranging populations. Our survey and literature reviews showed that Canadian zoos and wildlife rehabilitators are enthusiastic about bat conservation. However, none could currently maintain the target species, due to limited infrastructure and/ or knowledge gaps related to husbandry and reintroduction of captive bats to the wild. Captive management is unlikely to stabilize target populations because released bats risk re-infection. We conclude that ex situ management is not an appropriate tool in our case study, and would represent ineffective use of available conservation resources. However, development of captive husbandry and re-introduction methods for hibernating, insectivorous bats would contribute to our global capacity to conserve similar species.",
