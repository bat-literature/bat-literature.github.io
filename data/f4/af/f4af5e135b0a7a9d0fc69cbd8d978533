These include instances when a bat is discovered in a room where a person awakens from sleep, is a child without an adult witness, has a mental disability or is intoxicated. The current ACIP guidelines, however, do not address PEP in the setting of multiple persons exposed to a bat or a bat colony, otherwise known as mass bat exposure (MBE) events. Due to a dearth of recommendations for response to these events, the reported reactions by public health agencies have varied widely. To address this perceived limitation, a survey of 45 state public health agencies was conducted to characterize prior experiences with MBE and practices to mitigate the public health risks. In general, most states (69% of the respondents) felt current ACIP guidelines were unclear in MBE scenarios. Thirty-three of the 45 states reported prior experience with MBE, receiving an average of 16.9 MBE calls per year and an investment of 106.7 person-hours annually on MBE investigations. PEP criteria, investigation methods and the experts recruited in MBE investigations varied between states. These dissimilarities could reﬂect differences in experience, scenario and resources. The lack of consistency in state responses to potential mass exposures to a highly fatal disease along with the large contingent of states dissatisﬁed with current ACIP guidance warrants the development of national guidelines in MBE settings.",

Faecal samples and dead individuals available from rehabilitation centres or collected from known roost sites were virologically tested. In total, 112 carcasses of bats found dead, and 44 faecal samples were analysed. Nineteen viral strains were isolated by in vitro cell culture from faecal and tissue samples of different bat species (Pipistrellus khulii, Tadarida teniotis, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Vespertilio murinus), and they were morphologically identiﬁed as reoviruses by negative staining electron microscopy observation. The deﬁnitive assignment of all isolates to MRV was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR assays targeting the L1 gene. Through a multiplex RTPCR assay targeting the S1 gene, we typed 15 of 19 isolates as MRV type 3. Partial L1 (416 bp) and complete S1 (1416 bp) sequences of the isolates were analysed and compared with those of reference strains obtained from GenBank, belonging to the three serotypes. Molecular analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the amino acid residues associated with neurotropism (198-204NLAIRLP, 249I, 350D and 419E) were highly conserved among the Italian bat strains. These results suggest that potentially neurotropic MRV type 3 strains are widespread among Italian bats. Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of MRV type 3 in bat species such as Pipistrellus Khulii, which is common in urban areas and known for its close contact with humans, underlines the need for vigilance.",

            "abstractNote": "Guaraquec¸aba city is a rain forest environmental protected area located on the southern coast of Brazil. Recently, the local Animal Health Service has noticed haematophagous bats feeding from humans and domestic animals, as well as bat colonies located in houses and public schools. In 2007, two non-haematophagous bats were tested positive by direct immunoﬂuorescence for rabies in a nearby city. Native fauna and environmental laws protect non-haematophagous bats in Brazilian preserved areas such as Guaraquec¸aba, making non-haematophagous bat population control almost impossible. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate a simple and feasible educational protocol applied by a multi-institutional task force in local elementary schools to prevent rabies transmitted by bats. Information was transmitted to children by video, lectures and oral question–answer section; evaluation was made by written questionnaires to teachers and students. Interinstitutional task force included public and animal health public services, a federal university and the city secretary of environment, of education, of agriculture and of animal health, and also participation of local community. Information was effectively absorbed by children when evaluated just after being given. As important, questionnaires showed that handling and playing with bats at day time was common in several elementary school students, exposing themselves to what may represent higher risk of rabies transmission than haematophagous bat feeding directly from humans. Training of teachers and students may effectively prevent rabies by bats in such communities. Insertion of this subject into science content of local elementary school educational programme was proposed in order to establish a continuing education programme on rabies transmitted by bats in environmental preserved areas.",

Vaginal plug formation begins by part of semen first jetted from cervical region and secretions of vaginal epithelium immediately after mating (at the end of August). These secretions are gradually solidified, accumulated, and moved toward the vaginal introitus while filling the vaginal lumen. This formation process continues through the copulation period and the hibernation period (from end of October to middle of March), maintaining vaginal plug throughout the next pregnancy period (from end of March to end of May). Finally, vaginal plug is discharged to the outside of vagina immediately before giving birth. Normal vaginal structures are taken from the nurturing period (from the beginning of June to the middle of August) and before mating period. Therefore, vaginal plug generated immediately after mating is important as a protective barrier to prevent re-mating with male. In addition, vaginal plug during pregnancy can protect fetus in the uterus from physical stimulation by preventing re-mating with male as a kind of defense mechanism to maintain healthy development of fetus in uterus.",

A collaborative study was established involving environmental biologists and veterinarians for rabies epidemiological research in a speciﬁc ecological area located at the Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The wild animals’ brains are required to be collected without skull damage because the skull’s measurements are important in the identiﬁcation of the captured animal species. For this purpose, samples from bats and small mammals were collected using an aspiration method by inserting a plastic pipette into the brain through the magnum foramen. While there is a progressive increase in the use of the plastic pipette technique in various studies undertaken, it is also appreciated that this method could foster collaborative research between wildlife scientists and rabies epidemiologists thus improving rabies surveillance.",

Flight experiments showed that pups began to ﬂutter with a short horizontal displacement at 10 days and ﬁrst took ﬂight at 19 days, with most achieving sustained ﬂight at 1 month old. Analysis of covariance on wingspan, wing area, and the other seven wing characteristics between ‘pre-ﬂight’ and ‘post-volancy’ periods supports the hypothesis that growth had one ‘pre-ﬂight’ trajectory and a different ‘post-volancy’ trajectory in bats. Wingspan, handwing length and area, armwing length and area, and total wing area increased linearly until the age of ﬁrst ﬂight, after which the growth rates decreased (all P < 0.001). Wing loading declined linearly until day 19 before ultimately decreasing to adult levels (P < 0.001). Additionally, the relationship of different pairwise combinations of bony components composing span-wise length and chord-wise length was evaluated to test the hypothesis that compensatory growth of wing bones in H. pomona occurred in both ‘pre-ﬂight’ and ‘post-volancy’ periods. The frequency of short–long and long–short pairs was signiﬁcantly greater than that of short–short, long–long pairs in most pairs of bone elements in adults. The results indicate that a bone ‘shorter than expected’ would be compensated by a bone or bones ‘longer than expected’, suggesting compensatory growth in H. pomona. The pairwise comparisons conducted in adults were also performed in young bats during ‘pre-ﬂight’ and ‘post-volancy’ periods, demonstrating that compensatory growth occurred throughout postnatal ontogeny.",

The results suggest that the hair characteristics such as scale cuticle, divergence from the shaft and degree of hastateness varied among different species of bats. The coronal divergent scale was found in P. coromandra, P. ceylonicus, H. fulvus, and H. lankadiva while coronal divaricate scale was found in R. micorphyllum and R. hardwickii. However, imbricate type of scale was found in S. kuhlii, S. heathii and M. lyra with different degree of hastateness among them. The different types of hastateness found among these insectivorous bats include unequal hastate, equal hastate, alternate, elongate, rounded, simple, denticulate, acuminate and cusped. The hair characteristics such as hair length, scale length, scale width, scale index and width index differed among different species. However, there was no difference in the structure of scales among dorsal, ventral and neck hairs. The ultrastructural diverseness in the hair morphology of different insectivorous species suggests that the structural features of hairs could be used for species recognition.",

Kaznadzey (2018) Despite huge progress in the systematics of bats and, in particular, of the Vespertilionidae family in latest years, the taxonomic position of a number of remarkable bat species has been uncertain until now, partly because of limits in acceptable comparative material. Researchers have previously placed the Malayan noctule, Pipistrellus stenopterus, into Nyctalus, because of similar body shape and proportions, or into Pipistrellus, based on karyological analysis. This study reassesses Pipistrellus stenopterus using available collection material and compares it to various members of Nyctalus and Pipistrellus, as well as with some other related and similar genera, based on respective morphological and molecular genetic features. This species demonstrates vast morphological peculiarities compared to other Pipistrellus-like bats. Nonetheless, both mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers unequivocally place it close to other Asian pipistrelles, most probably in a sister position to the “javanicus” species group. We propose establishing P. stenopterus as a separate subgenus, Alionoctula. Our results also confirm that Pipistrellus is paraphyletic in its current state, and we suggest that further studies explore its internal taxonomy and limits.",

The timing, duration and patterns of reproduction in bats vary considerably among species and different localities. Though much is known about the reproductive phenomena and associated endocrine characteristics of various species, the central mechanism regulating the peculiar delay and asynchrony in reproductive activity remains to be elucidated. The current understanding on the endocrine characteristics and possible mechanism of regulation of the hypothalamo-adenohypophysial-gonadal axis of bats will be reviewed, based mainly on our own studies in hibernating rhinolophid bats.",

The cross-context variation in these behavioral tendencies, however, is rarely explored with animals in contexts associated with different locomotion modes. This study assessed the variation and repeatability in behavioral traits of bent-wing bats Miniopterus fuliginosus in southern Taiwan, and the effects of contextual settings associated with locomotion mode. The bats were sampled in the dry winter season, and their behaviors were measured in hole-board box (HB) and tunnel box (TB) tests, both suited for quadrupedal movements of the bats, and flight-tent (FT) tests that allowed for flying behaviors. The bats in the FT tests showed more interindividual and between-trial behavioral variation than those in the HB and TB tests. Nearly all of the behaviors in the TB and FT tests, but only half of those in the HB tests, showed medium to high repeatability. These repeatable behaviors were grouped into distinct behavioral traits of boldness, activity, and exploration, which were correlated to one another across contexts. In addition, we observed a consistently higher correlation between behavioral categories across the HB and TB contexts than between either of these contexts and the FT context. The results indicate consistent among-individual behavioral differences across time and contexts in wildly caught bent-wing bats. The findings of behavioral repeatability and cross-context correlations also indicate context-dependent variation and suggest that test devices which allow for flight behaviors, such as flight tents or cages, may provide a more suitable setting for measuring the behaviors and animal personalities of bats, particularly for those species that display less or little quadrupedal movements.",

Structural characteristics, microclimates, and disturbance levels of 17 roosts used by H. a. terasensis and 15 roosts either used by other bat species (2) or not occupied by any bat species were compared. Roosts used by these bats were signiﬁcantly larger in size and had greater areas covered by water compared to unused roosts. Entrances of active roosts were more likely to be east-west oriented. Hibernacula had lower entrances and ceilings than did roosts used only in summer. Higher temperatures were recorded in non-breeding roosts than in breeding roosts, but temperature gradients in these two types of roosts did not differ. In winter, hibernacula were warmer, and the temperature ﬂuctuated less than in non-hibernacula. The relative humidities in summer roosts and hibernacula were nearly 100%. Disturbance levels were signiﬁcantly higher in non-breeding roosts than in breeding roosts, and in non-hibernacula than in hibernacula.",

The present study was undertaken to examine sex differences and seasonal changes in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-immunoreactive (ir) neuronal system of Japanese bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. GnRH-ir neurons were preferentially distributed in the medial preoptic area (POA) and medial basal hypothalamus (MBH). The number and immunoreactivity of GnRH-ir neurons decreased in summer (lactation period in females and spermatogenic period in males), whereas both increased dramatically in winter (hibernation period). The number and immunoreactivity of GnRH-ir neurons varied more in the MBH than in the POA throughout the annual reproductive cycle of both sexes. The changes in GnRH neurons in the MBH closely paralleled those of GnRH-ir fibers in the median eminence (ME), which is the release site for GnRH. In contrast, there was no sex difference in the number and immunoreactivity of GnRH-ir neuronal perikarya in either region except for the number of GnRH-ir neurons in the POA in spring and summer. These findings suggest that GnRH neurons in the MBH supply the major GnRH innervation to the ME and play a central role in seasonal regulation of gonadotropin secretion in this bat.",

The aim of this study was to ascertain the differences among bat assemblages of three riparian forest areas of the Tinguá region, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. These areas were: I) an agricultural area (Takume); II) a reforested area in primary succession (Canavarro); and III) an area with late secondary vegetation (Tinguá Biological Reserve). Assessments of bat species composition in these areas may shed light on how anthropogenic modifications in riparian forests can influence local bat assemblages. Bats were captured with mist nets during 72 sampling nights. Total bat abundance was 1,511 individuals in 26 species. The three areas differed in their species composition. The Tinguá Biological Reserve was the richest area, Canavarro presented the lowest diversity and the highest abundance of individuals, and the evenness index was highest in Takume. The differences found in the composition and ecological indices indicate that bat assemblages have distinct characteristics in the three areas studied, with varied degrees of transformation and anthropization.

Here, we statistically compared 12 external characters of 169 specimens collected in three Brazilian biomes: 82 in the Pantanal (Mato Grosso), 45 in the Atlantic Forest (Ilhéus, Bahia) and 42 in the Caatinga (Chapada Diamantina, Bahia). Each character was analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. The t-test didn’t detect any differences between males and females of each population. The ANOVA with a posteriori Tukey test showed significant results for all traits (Forearm length, Calcar length, Body length, Tail length, Hindfoot length, Ear length, Tragus length, Thumb length, Noseleaf length, Noseleaf width and Horseshoe width) except for Tibia length. The discriminant analysis showed distinct clusters representing the populations of each biome. The tests demonstrated that the three populations are significantly different from one another and that the specimens of the population from the Caatinga, on average, are larger than those from the Pantanal, which are larger than those from the Atlantic Forest, confirming the possible existence of intra-specific geographic variation.",

Species of Carollia appear to have differentiated recently in the late Cenozoic, and present overlapping morphological characters that may not be useful to distinguish among species. Carollia has recently been revised, but only a few specimens representing the Brazilian distribution of Carollia within Brazil were studied. We reviewed specimens of Carollia distributed in several localities of Brazil revisiting previously described morphological characters for species identification, and taxonomic problems within the genus. We found a large degree of overlap between characters previously used to distinguish among species of Carollia, and some of them constitute variation within a same species. We also report new records extending the known distribution of C. benkeithi to farther east of its previously known distribution (Parauapebas, southeastern Pará, and Vitória do Xingu, Pará, eastern Amazonian Brazil) and one record extending the distribution of C. brevicauda south to Corumbá, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.

The phenomenon of bat-turbine interaction appears widespread and is not well understood. This paper proposes the use of some fundamental analytical methods that estimate a bat’s ability to detect and potentially avoid the moving blades of an operational turbine rotor. These equations are applied to selected models of existing turbines and microturbines. A ‘rotor rating’ system is proposed that could assist the evaluation of current and future turbine designs in terms of maximising the bat’s chance of blade detection. It is shown that features such as rotor angular velocity, number of blades, blade width and bat species influence the likelihood of rotor detection.",

An onboard, integrated multisensor system capable of providing detection of turbine collision events, including taxonomic information, was developed. The conceptual design of a multisensor system including a vibration sensing node, an optics node, and an bioacoustic node with an event-driven trigger architecture was field-tested on utility-scale wind turbines. A pixel density computational model was built to estimate the spatial coverage and target resolution to the optimized configuration for camera placement. Field test results of the vibration node showed that nearly half of the recorded impact events were successfully identified by visual inspection and running short-time Fourier transform on recorded vibration signals. The remaining undetected impact events were masked under background noise due to low impact energy and high background noise of the operating turbine, which result in subsequent low signal-to-noise ratio. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of triggering the system through single impact event sensed by vibration sensors.",

Bats were captured from different locations in Slovenia and blood samples, mouth and brain swabs were collected from live and dead bats. 260 samples of oral swabs and 38 brain samples were tested by specific RT-PCR assay to detect lyssavirus genome.\nResults: 216 blood samples, collected from the same bats, were tested by FAVN (Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization) test to detect the prevalence of lyssavirus antibodies among bats. Virus RNA was not detected in any of the samples, all blood samples werealso negative for specific antibodies.\nConclusions: Despite the data from this study, EBL viruses can cause fatal infections in humans and all bats involved in contact incidents with humans should be tested to determine whether the victim was exposed to EBL virus. In order to prevent lyssavirus transmission from bats to humans, all bat handlers and laboratory personnel should be informed about the possible risk of lyssavirus exposure via bats and their vaccination against rabies is strongly recommended .",

We found 151 bat casualties, most of which were hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). We recorded 3,718 bat passes at bat foraging and roosting areas within 3.6 km of the wind plant (x=48/detector-night) and 452 bat passes at wind turbines (x-=1.9/detector-night). Peak bat activity at turbines followed the same trend as bat mortality and occurred from mid-July through the end of August. Based on the timing of fall bat migration, we believe that most bat mortality involved migrating bats. There was no significant relationship between bat activity at turbines or the number of fatalities and presence of lights on turbines. We captured 103 bats comprised of 5 species in mist nets. Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) comprised most of the captures. Our study indicated that there were relatively large breeding populations of bats near the wind plant when collision mortality was low to nonexistent. Future research should concentrate on determining causes of bat collisions and methods to reduce or mitigate the mortality.",

The average number of species detected per site did not differ between the 2 techniques, but neither technique identified all of the bat species present at all sites. Because both mist-netting and ultrasonic detection may incompletely sample bat communities, we advise using both techniques when conducting surveys for bat species presence.",

            "abstractNote": "Context. Globally, insectivorous bats are important moderators of insect populations, including agricultural pests. However, in human-modified environments, changes to insect diversity and abundance may have detrimental impacts on bat populations. The southern bent-wing bat (SBWB; Miniopterus orianae bassanii), is a critically endangered, cave-dwelling bat with a restricted distribution across south-eastern Australia, an area now dominated by agricultural land uses. Understanding SBWB diet may highlight the role of bats in influencing insect populations in surrounding agricultural land, while simultaneously providing crucial data for conservation management of this critically endangered species. Aim. To investigate the SBWB’s diet using arthropod DNA metabarcoding of scats and guano collected from seven caves across the species’ range. Methods. We collected scats from bat roosts and from guano piles on cave floors during late summer and early autumn of 2019. We used PCR to amplify two short, overlapping arthropod mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 barcodes and sequenced these using the Illumina MiSeq to identify arthropod diet species. Key results. Moths (order Lepidoptera) were the most prevalent insect identified in all samples and from all sites. Many of the 67 moth species identified were associated with agricultural land use (e.g. pasture webworm (Hednota pedionoma) and armyworm (Persectania dyscrita)), and several, including the bogong moth (Agrotis infusa), are migratory, suggesting the SBWB’s diet changes seasonally. Conclusion. By describing the diet of the SBWB, we have fulfilled one recommendation of the national recovery plan for the species. The SBWB preys predominantly on moths, and its diet has likely been impacted by the increase in agricultural land use across its range. Further research is required to understand its foraging habitat requirements. Implications. Our findings suggest the SBWB may play a role in controlling populations of moth species considered to be agricultural pests. The wide variety of moths consumed by SBWBs could afford the species some resilience to landscape changes affecting moth assemblages. The methodological framework developed here could be applied to investigate how land-use changes may contribute to bat population declines, but also how insectivorous bats may provide important ecosystem services by controlling pest insect species in modified landscapes.",

Pseudogymnoascus destructans is the fungus responsible for white-nose syndrome (WNS), which has killed millions of hibernating bats in North America, but also occurs in bats in Europe and China without causing large-scale population effects. This is likely to be due to differences in species susceptibility and behaviour, and environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity. Pseudogymnoascus destructans is currently believed to be absent from Australia.",

Undertaking surveys to conﬁrm species presence or to estimate population sizes can be difﬁcult, particularly for elusive species. Bats are able to detect and avoid traps, making it difﬁcult to quantify abundance. Although acoustic surveys using bat detectors are often used as a surrogate for relative abundance, the implicit assumption that there is a positive correlation between activity levels and abundance is rarely tested.",

It starts with a short overview of common methods used to estimate mortality based on carcass searches. Then, it guides step by step through a simple example. First, the proportion of animals that fall into the search area is estimated. Second, carcass persistence time is estimated based on experimental data. Third, searcher efficiency is estimated. Fourth, these three estimated parameters are combined to obtain the probability that an animal killed is found by an observer. Finally, this probability is used together with the observed number of carcasses found to obtain an estimate for the total number of killed animals together with a credible interval.",

At the same time, concerns about the number of birds and bats being killed at wind turbines have been growing. In this situation, methods for a reliable estimation of bird and bat fatality numbers are needed. To obtain an unbiased estimate of the number of fatalities from fatality searches, the probability to detect the carcass of an animal being killed at a turbine has to be assessed by considering carcass persistence rate, searcher eﬃciency and the probability that a killed animal falls into a searched area. Here, we describe a new formula to determine the detection probability of birds or bats that are killed at wind turbines and which can estimate the number of fatalities from the number of carcasses found. The formula was developed to analyse a large data set of bats killed at wind turbines in Germany. In simulations, we compared it to three other formulas used in this context. Our new formula seems to have unbiased results when searcher eﬃciency and carcass removal rate are constant over time. When searcher eﬃciency or carcass removal rate varied with time, all four formulas showed a similar bias. These comparative results can be used to choose between methods depending on the quality of information available. Our estimator can, for instance, be adapted to diﬀerent situations including temporal changes of searcher eﬃciency or carcass removal rate because it is based on an explicit process model.",

Using 2 approaches (roosting and foraging) to categorize forest habitat for bats, we evaluated how restoration treatments may affect habitat use. We hypothesized that more foraging activity would occur in thinned stands because more species are adapted to open forest, but that more roosts would occur in unthinned stands where snags were unaffected by mechanical treatments and prescribed fire. During the summers of 2006 and 2007, we used acoustic detectors to record call rates of bats as a measure of activity level and compared activity levels among stands that had undergone 3 thinning treatments (light, moderate, and heavy, with 245, 172, or 142 trees per hectare postthinning, respectively) and an unthinned stand as a control (1201 trees per hectare). With radiotelemetry, we located roosts used by reproductive females of 2 common species of forest-associated bats (long-eared myotis, Myotis evotis, and Arizona myotis, Myotis occultus) during summer 2007. We measured roost characteristics at 3 spatial scales (roost, microplot, and surrounding landscape) to contrast between roosts used by Myotis species and randomly selected comparison snags, microplots, and study area landscape. Among thinned and unthinned stands we did not detect a difference in activity levels for all bats (P = 0.2), nor a difference in call rates for Myotis spp. (P = 0.1). However, there was lower activity (P = 0.01) for non-Myotis bats in unthinned compared to thinned stands. This is probably because most non-Myotis species are better adapted to foraging in open forests. Of 24 roosts for long-eared myotis and Arizona myotis, only 31% and 25%, respectively, occurred in thinned stands. Bats selected large-diameter (>68 cm diameter at breast height) ponderosa pine snags with exfoliating bark. Roosts for Arizona myotis were in areas with elements of old-growth structure, whereas roosts for long-eared myotis occurred in areas similar to stratified, midsuccessional, even-aged forest. Managing for large-diameter ponderosa pine snags and a variety of tree densities and age classes will provide roosting and foraging habitat for bats. We found no distinct “best” treatment to recommend overall, likely because of species differences, with some bats better adapted to opencanopy and some to closed-canopy forest. Maintaining diverse habitat will support a diverse bat assemblage.",

Because of its biological importance, the basin is considered a terrestrial priority region (RTP-059) by CONABIO, the institution responsible for inventorying Mexican biodiversity. Several vegetation types occur in this relatively small area (cloud and tropical forests, conifer forests, subtropical scrub). However, the area has been undersampled because of its difficult access and topographic complexity. Based on our own collections, review of museum specimens, and literature records, we recorded 92 species at 10 major sites throughout the basin. Twenty-three species are endemic to Mexico, 9 of which are endemic to the SMO. Six species were recorded for the first time in the state of Nayarit, and 2 in the state of Jalisco. These findings increased the species count for the SMO of Nayarit by 17 species. Turnover rate was high throughout the region. The number of endemisms of RTP-059 equals or surpasses that of most megadiverse protected areas in Mexico, and this area is likely to be a center of origin for several taxa. No protected areas exist within RTP-059 because its social and natural complexity makes it difficult to establish effective conservation strategies.",

Although we did not know the true identity of these bats, we could still compare the pairwise agreement between software packages when identifying the same call sequences. If accuracy is high in these software packages, there should be high agreement in identification. Agreement in identification by species averaged approximately 40% and varied by software package, species, and data set. Our results are not consistent with the high accuracy often claimed by some software packages and may be a warning about the importance of understanding accuracy of acoustical identification in designing ecological experiments and interpreting results.",

The eastern race, E. f. fuscus, is reportedly bigger and darker than its western counterpart E. f. pallidus. Where these 2 subspecies come in contact is the subject of debate. We used external, cranial, and colorimetric data to investigate geographic variation among populations of E. fuscus in Nebraska to determine the location of the zone of contact between E. f. fuscus and E. f. pallidus. We discovered significant variation in external, cranial, and colorimetric data, suggesting that E. fuscus is represented by 2 subspecies in Nebraska. Our results showed that E. f. pallidus is smaller, possesses lighter pelage, and is restricted to the northern and western parts of Nebraska, whereas E. f. fuscus is larger, possesses darker pelage, and occurs in southern and southeastern parts of the state. Populations located between these regions represent intergrades of the 2 subspecies. We suggest that the subspecific boundary represents a broad zone of integration running in a northeast to southwest direction and may reflect the position of temperature and precipitation clines.",

Estimates of amino acid identities of the hexon protein have shown that potentially novel Bat mastadenovirus BatAdV-KZ01 shared higher similarity with monkey Rhesus adenovirus 59 (74.29%) than with Bat AdVs E and H (74.00%). Phylogenetically, BatAdV-KZ01 formed a separate clade, distant from Bat AdVs and other mammalian AdVs. Since adenoviruses are essential pathogens for many mammals, including humans and bats, this ﬁnding is of interest from both scientiﬁc and epidemiological points of view.",

            "abstractNote": "Co-infection is an underappreciated phenomenon in contemporary disease ecology despite its ubiquity and importance in nature. Viruses, and other co-infecting agents, can interact in ways that shape host and agent communities, inﬂuence infection dynamics, and drive evolutionary selective pressures. Bats are host to many viruses of zoonotic potential and have drawn increasing attention in their role as wildlife reservoirs for human spillover. However, the role of co-infection in driving viral transmission dynamics within bats is unknown. Here, we systematically review peer-reviewed literature reporting viral co-infections in bats. We show that viral co-infection is common in bats but is often only reported as an incidental ﬁnding. Biases identiﬁed in our study database related to virus and host species were pre-existing in virus studies of bats generally. Studies largely speculated on the role co-infection plays in viral recombination and few investigated potential drivers or impacts of co-infection. Our results demonstrate that current knowledge of co-infection in bats is an ad hoc by-product of viral discovery efforts, and that future targeted co-infection studies will improve our understanding of the role it plays. Adding to the broader context of co-infection studies in other wildlife species, we anticipate our review will inform future co-infection study design and reporting in bats. Consideration of detection strategy, including potential viral targets, and appropriate analysis methodology will provide more robust results and facilitate further investigation of the role of viral co-infection in bat reservoirs.",
