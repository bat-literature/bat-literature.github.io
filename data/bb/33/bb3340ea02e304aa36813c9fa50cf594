            "abstractNote": "Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island, B.C. is an area of high-profile land-use conflict. In 1995, local scientific and management groups recognized bats as an important component of forest ecosystems. With almost no existing bat information for this area, we began studies of the bat community, with the goal of inventorying the bat community and identifying critical bat habitat at both landscape and stand levels. Identification of the important habitat will provide forest managers with guidelines that may minimize impacts of forest harvesting on bat populations. Over the 3 summers of field study we captured 6 species of bat: Myotis lucifugus, M. yumanensis, M. californicus, M. evotis, M. keenii, and Lasionycteris noctivagans. In addition, we confirmed the presence of Eptesicus fuscus through ultrasonic bat detection. From 1996 to 1998, Anabat II bat detectors were used to survey the relative flight and feeding activities of bat species in a variety of forest stands. Significantly higher bat activity was recorded in tall, open forests at lower elevations. In addition, more bat activity was recorded in stands dominated by amabilis fir compared to stands dominated by yellow-cedar. To evaluate the usefulness to bats of buffers around riparian areas, we placed bat detectors 10, 30, and 100 m away from creeks and lakes. There was significantly more foraging activity up to 30 m away from the water’s edge, as compared to forest interior sites (>100 m). To assess roost sites as an element of critical habitat, we radio-tracked male and female bats to their roosts. We found 9 bat roosts. Although there are 6 main tree species in Clayoquot Sound, all 5 tree roosts were in large-diameter western redcedar trees, suggesting this is an important species for roosting bats. The remaining 4 roosts were found in cliffs.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Massive die-offs of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) have been occurring since 2006 in hibernation sites around Albany, New York, and this problem has spread to other States in the Northeastern United States. White cottony fungal growth is seen on the snouts of affected animals, a prominent sign of White Nose Syndrome (WNS). A previous report described the involvement of the fungus Geomyces destructans in WNS, but an identical fungus was recently isolated in France from a bat that was evidently healthy. The fungus has been recovered sparsely despite plentiful availability of afflicted animals.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We have investigated 100 bat and environmental samples from eight affected sites in 2008. Our findings provide strong evidence for an etiologic role of G. destructans in bat WNS. (i) Direct smears from bat snouts, Periodic Acid Schiff-stained tissue sections from infected tissues, and scanning electron micrographs of bat tissues all showed fungal structures similar to those of G. destructans. (ii) G. destructans DNA was directly amplified from infected bat tissues, (iii) Isolations of G. destructans in cultures from infected bat tissues showed 100% DNA match with the fungus present in positive tissue samples. (iv) RAPD patterns for all G. destructans cultures isolated from two sites were indistinguishable. (v) The fungal isolates showed psychrophilic growth. (vi) We identified in vitro proteolytic activities suggestive of known fungal pathogenic traits in G. destructans.\nConclusions/Significance: Further studies are needed to understand whether G. destructans WNS is a symptom or a trigger for bat mass mortality. The availability of well-characterized G. destructans strains should promote an understanding of bat–fungus relationships, and should aid in the screening of biological and chemical control agents.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats in the northeastern U.S. are affected by geomycosis caused by the fungus Geomyces destructans (Gd). This infection is commonly referred to as White Nose Syndrome (WNS). Over a million hibernating bats have died since the fungus was first discovered in 2006 in a cave near Albany, New York. A population viability analysis conducted on little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), one of six bat species infected with Gd, suggests regional extinction of this species within 20 years. The fungus Gd is a psychrophile (‘‘cold loving’’), but nothing is known about how it thrives at low temperatures and what pathogenic attributes allow it to infect bats. This study aimed to determine if currently available antifungal drugs and biocides are effective against Gd. We tested five Gd strains for their susceptibility to antifungal drugs and high-throughput screened (HTS) one representative strain with SpectrumPlus compound library containing 1,920 compounds. The results indicated that Gd is susceptible to a number of antifungal drugs at concentrations similar to the susceptibility range of human pathogenic fungi. Strains of Gd were susceptible to amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole. In contrast, very high MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of flucytosine and echinocandins were needed for growth inhibition, which were suggestive of fungal resistance to these drugs. Of the1,920 compounds in the library, a few caused 50% - to greater than 90% inhibition of Gd growth. A number of azole antifungals, a fungicide, and some biocides caused prominent growth inhibition. Our results could provide a theoretical basis for future strategies aimed at the rehabilitation of most affected bat species and for decontamination of Gd in the cave environment.",

            "abstractNote": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus that can pose a serious threat to human and livestock health. Old-world fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) are the natural reservoir hosts for NiV, and Pteropus lylei, Lyle’s ﬂying fox, is an important host of NiV in mainland Southeast Asia. NiV can be transmitted from bats to humans directly via bat-contaminated foods (i.e., date palm sap or fruit) or indirectly via livestock or other intermediate animal hosts. Here we construct risk maps for NiV spillover and transmission by combining ecological niche models for the P. lylei bat reservoir with other spatial data related to direct or indirect NiV transmission (livestock density, foodborne sources including fruit production, and human population). We predict the current and future (2050 and 2070) distribution of P. lylei across Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Our best-ﬁt model predicted that central and western regions of Thailand and small areas in Cambodia are currently the most suitable habitats for P. lylei. However, due to climate change, the species range is predicted to expand to include lower northern, northeastern, eastern, and upper southern Thailand and almost all of Cambodia and lower southern Vietnam. This expansion will create additional risk areas for human infection from P. lylei in Thailand. Our combined predictive risk maps showed that central Thailand, inhabited by 2.3 million people, is considered highly suitable for the zoonotic transmission of NiV from P. lylei. These current and future NiV transmission risk maps can be used to prioritize sites for active virus surveillance and developing awareness and prevention programs to reduce the risk of NiV spillover and spread in Thailand.",

They are often persecuted if they are perceived as agricultural pests, but the extent of crop damage from flying foxes and the factors triggering their visits to crops are not well established. This study aimed to investigate wildlife-caused damage to tankan oranges Citrus tankan on Okinawa Island, Japan, and interactions between the Ryukyu flying fox Pteropus dasymallus and farmers. We compiled data from three sources: official records of wildlife-caused crop damage, questionnaire surveys of  farmers and time-lapse camera surveys conducted at  locations during January–February . Official records and the questionnaire survey indicated that the large-billed crow Corvus macrorhynchos caused most damage in a typical year (–% of the total damage), followed by P. dasymallus (–%). However, time-lapse camera surveys suggested negligible damage caused by P. dasymallus (.%) in , a typhoon-free year. Farmers perceived a decline in local population size and stated that at least , P. dasymallus individuals had died in their orchards during –. If this is extrapolated to the whole region, fatalities could have reached ,–, individuals during that period. Binomial regression performed on official records demonstrated that damage by P. dasymallus was largely explained by interannual cyclonic activity. Prevalent netting practices could be a serious threat to P. dasymallus: % of interviewees reported that flying foxes die from entanglement in their nets. Nevertheless, half of these farmers were satisfied with current crop protection measures. These findings call for prompt remediation with particular focus on implementing more bat-friendly crop protection following strong typhoon seasons.",

Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are the most likely natural reservoir for marburgviruses and entry into caves and mines that they stay in has often been associated with outbreaks of MVD. On the other hand, the natural reservoir for ebola viruses remains elusive; however, handling of wild animal carcasses has been associated with some outbreaks of EVD. In the last two decades, there has been an increase in the incidence of FHF outbreaks in Africa, some being caused by a newly found virus and some occurring in previously unaffected areas such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, in which the most recent EVD outbreak occurred in 2014. Indeed, the predicted geographic distribution of filoviruses and their potential reservoirs in Africa includes many countries in which FHF has not been reported. To minimize the risk of virus dissemination in previously unaffected areas, there is a need for increased investment in health infrastructure in African countries, policies to facilitate collaboration between health authorities from different countries, implementation of outbreak control measures by relevant multi-disciplinary teams and education of the populations at risk.",

Recent phylogenetic analyses of Pteropus from the western Indian Ocean found low sequence divergence and poor phylogenetic resolution among several morphologically defined species. We reexamine the phylogenetic relationships of these taxa by using multiple individuals per species. In addition, we estimate population genetic structure in two well-sampled taxa occurring on Madagascar and the Comoro Islands (P. rufus and P. seychellensis comorensis). Despite finding a similar pattern of low sequence divergence among species, increased sampling provides insight into the phylogeographic history of western Indian Ocean Pteropus, uncovering high levels of gene flow within species.",

Cynopterus brachyotis, a bat common in cities, is known to provide important ecosystem services, such as seed dispersal. Studying its diet offers insights into how ecological roles of bats in tropical landscapes could be affected by urbanisation. We documented the diet of C. brachyotis in Singapore, and tested the hypothesis that urbanisation decreases dietary breadth and proportion of native plants in its diet. We collected droppings of C. brachyotis at nine sites, and used morphological and molecular methods to identify plant species they contained. We evaluated whether species richness, proportion of native species and composition of plants in diet varied according to various urbanisation metrics. We recorded 33 plant species belonging to 25 genera and 21 families. Ten are native, 17 are exotic, and six are indeterminate. Twelve have never been reported in diets of C. brachyotis anywhere. Contrary to our hypotheses, urbanisation was not associated with reduced dietary breadth or declining reliance on native plants. Our results suggest urban C. brachyotis have a generalist approach to foraging and can readily exploit exotic plants as food. Because urbanisation does not affect dietary breadth or the proportion of native species they eat, these bats potentially continue to play important ecological roles by dispersing seeds of native plants even in the most urbanised sites, which is important in aiding succession in degraded landscapes. However, they may equally disperse exotic species they have exploited.",

Niche theory predicts that increasing species richness in assemblages can either lead to denser packing of niche space (‘niche packing’) or an expansion into its novel regions (‘niche expansion’). Traditionally, these scenarios have been studied using functional traits but stable isotopes provide advantages such as identifying the degree of resource specialisation, or niche partitioning among functionally similar species.\n                \n                \n                  In this study, we evaluate the relevance of niche packing versus niche expansion by investigating stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic niche width and overlap among 23 bat species from six functional groups across a 1500 m elevational gradient in the Himalaya.\n                \n                \n                  Our results suggest that an increase in species richness in the low elevation is accompanied by small niche width with high overlap, whereas the high elevation assemblage shows large niche width with low overlap among functional group members. At the functional group level, edge‐space foraging, trawling, and active gleaning bats have the highest niche width while passive gleaning bats that are only found in high elevations are isotopic specialists showing low overlap with other groups. Edge and open‐space foraging bats showed idiosyncratic changes in niche width across elevations. We also find that the niches of rhinolophid bats overlap with edge‐space and open‐space foraging bats despite their unique functional traits.\n                \n                \n                  These results support the idea that at low elevations high species richness is associated with niche packing while at high elevations strong niche partitioning prevails in dynamic and resource‐poor environments. We conclude that although high elevation animal assemblages are often ‘functionally underdispersed’, that is show homogenous functional traits, our approach based on stable isotopes demonstrates niche partitioning among such functionally similar species.\n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            सारांश\n            \n              \n                \n                  पर्वतीय क्षेत्रों में ऊंचाई के अनुसार जैव प्रजातियों की संख्या में परिवर्तन होना एक स्तापित क्रिया है। ‘नीश’ सिद्धांत के अनुसार एक क्षेत्र में विद्यमान प्रजातियों की संख्या में वृद्धि के दो कारक हैं: (i) जैव समुदाय की सदस्य प्रजातियों की ‘नीश’ के घनत्व में वृद्धि (यानि ‘नीश पैकिंग’), या फिर (ii) कुछ सदस्य प्रजातियों की ‘नीश’ में फैलाव (यानि ‘नीश एक्सपेंशन’)। इन दो स्थितियों की जांच आइसोटोप के माध्यम से अध्ययन से अलग‐अलग प्राणियों के आहार और वास स्थलों (जो उनकी नीश के मुख्य भाग है) का अनुमान लगाया जा सकता है, और जाना जा सकता है की विभिन्न प्रजातियां आहार व वास स्थलों का किस प्रकार परस्पर विभाजन करती हैं।\n                \n                \n                  किये गए शोध से हमने १५०० से ३००० मी की ऊंचाई में फैले चमगादड़ों के समुदाय में आइसोटोप अध्ययन के उपयोग से ‘नीश पैकिंग’ व ‘एक्सपेंशन’ का आंकलन किया। इस समुदाय में चमगादड़ों की २३ प्रजातियाँ मौजूद हैं।\n                \n                \n                  इस शोध से हमने पाया कि कम ऊँचाई वाले क्षेत्रों में चमगादड़ों की विविधता सदस्य प्रजातियों की नीश में अधिक घनत्व है। वहीं दूसरी ओर, ऊँचे क्षेत्रों में कम विविधता पायी जाती है, और सदस्य प्रजातियों की नीश में साफ़ विभाजन प्रतीत होता है। जो प्रजातियाँ वनों के किनारों में आहार तलाशती हैं, जल सतह के ऊपर मंडराते कीड़ों का शिकार करती हैं, या वृक्षों से कीड़े प्राप्त करती हैं, उनकी नीश सबसे विस्तृत पायी गयी। यह सामने आया कि ऊँचे क्षेत्रों में पाए जाने वाले लम्बे कानों वाले चमगादड़ केवल कुछ चुनिंदा पदार्थों का ही सेवन करते हैं। राइनोलॉफिडी परिवार के चमगादड़ों की नीश वनों के किनारों पर रहने वाले, और हवा में उड़कर शिकार करने वाले चमगादड़ों के सामान पाई गयीं।\n                \n                \n                  चमगादड़ों को उदाहरण मानकर हमारे शोध के परिणाम इस बात की पुष्टि करते हैं कि जैव प्रजातियों की विविधता बढ़ने पर निचले क्षेत्रों में ‘नीश पैकिंग’ सक्रिय होती है, जबकि ऊँचे क्षेत्रों की कठिन परिस्थितियों में जीव परस्पर प्रतिस्पर्धा घटाने के लिए अपने नीश का विभाजन करते हैं। पारम्परिक तकनीकों की तुलना में आइसोटोप अध्ययन तकनीक नीश क्रियाओं का सूक्ष्म अध्ययन करने में कहीं अधिक कारगर हैं।",

The smaller dog-faced dwarf\n              Molossops temminckii\n              is distributed from Colombia to Argentina and has a wide morphological variation and vocal plasticity. In Colombia, this species remains poorly known. To fill distributional gaps, we present novel records from Arauca, Atlántico, Bolívar, Córdoba, and Huila departments. We also present an analysis of the morphometric variation in South America using Principal Component Analyses. These show an external and cranial difference of specimens of Colombia in respect of other and South America populations. In Colombian landscapes dominated by the floodplain savanna of the Orinoco region,\n              Molossops temminckii\n              is smaller than in the other regions of the country, and the previously suggested existence of cryptic diversity within the taxon should be evaluated. Therefore, we suggest further integrative analyses to investigate a possible subspecific status of some Colombian populations.",

Coronaviruses (CoV) have been detected in pteropodid bats from several Southeast Asian countries, but little is known about coronaviruses in the Indonesian archipelago in proportion to its mammalian biodiversity. In this study, we screened pooled faecal samples from the Indonesian colonies of Pteropus vampyrus with unbiased next-generation sequencing. Bat CoVs related to Rousettus leschenaultii CoV HKU9 and Eidolon helvum CoV were detected. The 121 faecal samples were further screened using a conventional hemi-nested pan-coronavirus PCR assay. Three positive samples were successfully sequenced, and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses. CoVs belonging to the subgenera Nobecovirus, Decacovirus and Pedacovirus were detected in a single P. vampyrus roost. This study expands current knowledge of coronavirus diversity in Indonesian flying foxes, highlighting the need for longitudinal surveillance of colonies as continuing urbanization and deforestation heighten the risk of spillover events.",

Most juveniles died within two weeks of age (67.4%). The cause of this phenomenon is not known. The results of chemical analyses carried out in five dead juveniles showed neither the presence of heavy metals nor pesticides in the bodies. The dissection of cadavers revealed a good nutrition state. In all dissected individuals, intestinal inflammation was recorded. Most juveniles in the colony were significantly parasitised. In the period of parturition, it was cold and very rainy for several days, the mortality thus may have been caused by chilling of the juveniles. The effort of females to nurse even the dying juveniles which fell down from the colony was observed. The mortality of juveniles was checked in further 28 control colonies in different parts of the Czech Republic in 2020. At eight sites, making up 27.6% of all studied sites, the mortality of 10.1–20.0% was recorded. At the remaining twenty sites (69% of the studied sites), the mortality reached 0–10%. High mortality of juveniles of M. myotis (18.7–39.2%) was also recorded at Vyšší Brod (Český Krumlov Dist.) in the years 1988–1991. In that case, the probable cause was the application of Lastanox (tributyltin oxide), a toxic chemical used for timber treatment in the colony roost.",

            "abstractNote": "Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) is closely related to the classical rabies virus and has been associated with three human fatalities and two equine fatalities in Australia. ABLV infection in humans causes encephalomyelitis, resulting in fatal disease, but has no effective therapy. The virus is maintained in enzootic circulation within fruit bats (Pteropid spp.) and at least one insectivorous bat variety (Saccolaimus flaviventris). Most frequently, laboratory testing is conducted on pteropodid bat brains, either following a potential human exposure through bites, scratches and other direct contacts with bats, or as opportunistic assessment of sick or dead bats. The level of medical intervention and post-exposure prophylaxis is largely determined on laboratory testing for antigen/virus as the demonstrable infection status of the in-contact bat. This study evaluates the comparative diagnostic performance of a lateral flow test, Anigen Rabies Ag detection rapid test (RDT), in pteropodid variant of ABLV-infected bat brain tissues. The RDT demonstrated 100% agreement with the reference standard fluorescent antibody test on 43 clinical samples suggesting a potential application in rapid diagnosis of pteropodid variant of ABLV infection. A weighted Kappa value of 0.95 confirmed a high level of agreement between both tests.",

This evolutionary relationship impressed the global media, which then emphasised bats as key actors in the spillover that resulted in the pandemic. In this study, we highlight changes in the traditional and new media coverage of bats and in Internet search volumes that occurred since the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic in 2020.\n                \n                \n                  We analysed Google and Wikipedia searches for bats and coronaviruses in 21 countries and eight languages, as well as television broadcasts in the USA, some of which have global coverage, between January 2016 and December 2020. In January 2020, the amount of television news about bats boomed, and news associated with the term ‘bat’ shifted to COVID‐19‐related topics. A nearly identical pattern was observed in Google searches during 2020 at the global scale. The daily time series of television coverage and Internet search volumes on bats and coronavirus in the USA covaried in the first quarter of 2020, in line with the existence of a media bubble. Time‐series analysis revealed that both the Google Trends index and visits to Wikipedia pages about bats boomed in early 2020, despite the fact that this time of year is usually characterised by low search volumes.\n                \n                \n                  Media coverage emphasised, correctly or not, the role of bats in the COVID‐19 pandemic and amplified public interest in bats worldwide. The public image of these mammals, in many cases threatened and important ecosystem service providers, was seriously compromised. We therefore recommend that policymakers and journalists prioritise scientifically accurate communication campaigns about bats, which would help counteract the surge in bat persecution, and leverage interest towards positive human–bat interactions.\n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Resumen en Español\n            \n              \n                \n                  SARS‐CoV‐2, el virus causante de la pandemia COVID‐19, es genómicamente símil al SARS‐tipo beta‐coronavirus encontrado en los murciélagos rinolófidos asiáticos. Esta relación evolutiva impresionó a los medios mundialmente, hasta tal punto que se ha enfatizado el papel de los murciélagos como uno de los principales vectores en la expansión de la pandemia. En este estudio, se resaltan los cambios producidos en la percepción de los murciélagos por los medios de comunicación (nuevos y tradicionales), y en las búsquedas en Internet que ocurrieron desde el inicio de la pandemia COVID‐19 en 2020.\n                \n                \n                  Para ello se han analizado las búsquedas del término ‘murciélago’ en Google y Wikipedia en 21 países y ocho lenguas, así como las retransmisiones televisivas en EE.UU. (algunas de las cuales con cobertura global) entre enero 2016 y diciembre 2020. En enero 2020, la cantidad de noticias televisadas sobre murciélagos se disparó, y el número de noticias previamente asociadas con el término ‘murciélago’ cambiaron por temáticas relacionadas con el COVID‐19. Un patrón idéntico puede ser observado a escala global en las búsquedas de Google durante el 2020. La serie temporal de cobertura televisiva y búsquedas en internet sobre murciélagos y coronavirus en EE.UU. covaría durante el primer cuarto del 2020, en líneo con la existencia de la burbuja mediática. El análisis de la cobertura diaria televisiva revela que tanto el índice Google Trend como las visitas a páginas de Wikipedia sobre murciélagos incrementaron al comienzo del 2020, a pesar de que esta época del año suele caracterizarse por bajos volúmenes de búsqueda.\n                \n                \n                  La cobertura mediática enfatizó, correctamente o no, el papel de los murciélagos en la propagación de la pandemia COVID‐19, ampliando el interés público a lo largo del globo. La imagen pública de estos mamíferos, en muchos casos especies amenazadas o proveedoras de importantes funciones ecosistémicas, ha sido seriamente comprometida. Por lo tanto, se recomienda a periodistas y responsables políticos la priorización de campañas de comunicación científicamente fundamentadas que ayuden a contrarrestar este aumento en la persecución de los murciélagos aprovechando el interés actual para concienciar al público de sus interacciones positivas con el hombre.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are reservoirs of various coronaviruses that can jump between bat species or other mammalian hosts, including humans. This article explores coronavirus infection in three bat species (Tadarida brasiliensis, Eumops bonariensis, and Molossus molossus) of the family Molossidae from Argentina using whole viral metagenome analysis. Fecal samples of 47 bats from three semiurban or highly urbanized areas of the province of Santa Fe were investigated. After viral particle enrichment, total RNA was sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 550 instrument; the reads were assembled into contigs and taxonomically and phylogenetically analyzed. Three novel complete Alphacoronavirus (AlphaCoV) genomes (Tb1–3) and two partial sequences were identified in T. brasiliensis (Tb4–5), and an additional four partial sequences were identified in M. molossus (Mm1–4). Phylogenomic analysis showed that the novel AlphaCoV clustered in two different lineages distinct from the 15 officially recognized AlphaCoV subgenera. Tb2 and Tb3 isolates appeared to be variants of the same virus, probably involved in a persistent infectious cycle within the T. brasiliensis colony. Using recombination analysis, we detected a statistically significant event in Spike gene, which was reinforced by phylogenetic tree incongruence analysis, involving novel Tb1 and AlphaCoVs identified in Eptesicus fuscus (family Vespertilionidae) from the U.S. The putative recombinant region is in the S1 subdomain of the Spike gene, encompass­ ing the potential receptor-binding domain of AlphaCoVs. This study reports the first AlphaCoV genomes in molossids from the Americas and provides new insights into recombination as an important mode of evolution of coronaviruses involved in crossspecies transmission.",

            "abstractNote": "Cryptic speciation and hybridization are two key processes that affect the origin and maintenance of biodiversity and our ability to understand and estimate it. To determine how these two processes interact, we studied allopatric and sympatric colonies of two cryptic bat species (Eptesicus serotinus and Eptesicus isabellinus) with parapatric distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. These species are the main reservoir for the most commonly rabies virus found in bats in Europe: the European bat Lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV‐1). We used mtDNA and nuclear microsatellite markers to confirm the taxonomic status of both species and to show a more pronounced and geographically based genetic structure in E. isabellinus than in its sibling E. serotinus. Using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), we inferred rapid range expansion in both species after the Last Glacial Maximum until reaching their present distributions. ABC analysis also supported interspecific differences in genetic diversity and structure, pointing to an earlier expansion of E. isabellinus northward. We found no evidence of mitochondrial introgression between species, but nuclear markers identified a male‐mediated ongoing asymmetric hybridization from E. isabellinus to E. serotinus (28% hybrids in E. serotinus and 5% in E. isabellinus) in the contact zone. Although none of the bats studied tested positive for Lyssavirus RNA, the asymmetric hybridization supports the potential for the recently suggested interspecific transmission of EBLV‐1 from E. isabellinus into E. serotinus.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding the ecological, behavioural and evolutionary response of organisms to changing environments is of primary importance in a human-altered world. It is crucial to elucidate how human activities alter gene flow and what are the consequences for the genetic structure of a species. We studied two lineages of the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) throughout the contact zone between mesic and arid Ecozones in the Middle East to evaluate the species' response to the growing proportion of human-altered habitats in the desert. We integrated population genetics, morphometrics and movement ecology to analyse population structure, morphological variation and habitat use from GPS- or radio-tagged individuals from both desert and Mediterranean areas. We classified the spatial distribution and environmental stratification by describing physical–geographical conditions and land cover. We analysed this information to estimate patch occupancy and used an isolation-by-resistance approach to model gene flow patterns. Our results suggest that lineages from desert and Mediterranean habitats, despite their admixture, are isolated by environment and by adaptation supporting their classification as ecotypes. We found a positive effect of human-altered habitats on patch occupancy and habitat use of fruit bats by increasing the availability of roosting and foraging areas. While this commensalism promotes the distribution of fruit bats throughout the Middle East, gene flow between colonies has not been altered by human activities. This discrepancy between habitat use and gene flow patterns may, therefore, be explained by the breeding system of the species and modifications of natal dispersal patterns.",

We investigated whether echolocating bats, given their limited reliance on vision, have poorer spatial resolving power (SRP) than pteropodids and whether tongue click echolocating fruit bats differ from non-echolocating fruit bats in terms of visual performance. We compared the number and distribution of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) as well as the maximum anatomical SRP derived from these distributions in 4 species of bats: <i>Myotis daubentonii</i>, a laryngeal echolocating bat from the family Vespertilionidae, <i>Rousettus aegyptiacus</i>, a tongue clicking echolocating bat from the family Pteropodidae, and <i>Pteropus alecto</i> and <i>P. poliocephalus</i>, 2 non-echolocating bats (also from the Pteropodidae). We find that all 3 pteropodids have a similar number (≈200,000 cells) and distribution of RGCs and a similar maximum SRP (≈4 cycles/degree). <i>M. daubentonii</i> has fewer (∼6,000 cells) and sparser RGCs than the pteropodids and thus a significantly lower SRP (0.6 cycles/degree). <i>M. daubentonii</i> also differs in terms of the distribution of RGCs by having a unique dorsal area of specialization in the retina. Our findings are consistent with the existing literature and suggest that <i>M. daubentonii</i> likely only uses vision for orientation, while for pteropodids vision is also important for foraging.",

We carried out a global examination of distributions of all nonmarine mammals to determine patterns of species richness, endemism, and endangerment, and to evaluate the degree of congruence among hotspots of these three measures of diversity in mammals. We then compare congruence of hotspots in two animal groups (mammals and birds) to assess the generality of these patterns. We defined hotspots as the richest 2.5% of cells in a global equal-area grid comparable to 1° latitude × 1° longitude. Hotspots of species richness, “endemism,” and extinction threat were noncongruent. Only 1% of cells and 16% of species were common to the three types of mammalian hotspots. Congruence increased with increases in both the geographic scope of the analysis and the percentage of cells defined as being hotspots. The within-mammal hotspot noncongruence was similar to the pattern recently found for birds. Thus, assigning global conservation priorities based on hotspots is at best a limited strategy.",

            "abstractNote": "Tropical forests contain the highest concentration of species in terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are disappearing rapidly due to forest clearing to extract timber illegally. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is one of the main sustainability proposals for earning proﬁts while still promoting biodiversity conservation. In the present study, we test the impacts of RIL on biodiversity and use the results to draw conclusions regarding the capacity of RIL to deliver conservation goals whilst also enabling minimal biodiversity impacts. We used a before-after-control-impact (BACI) study to assess the effects of RIL on a bat assemblage in Central Amazon. We sampled unlogged (control) and RIL areas before and after timber extraction. We also tested the relationship between forest canopy openness and bat assemblage before and after logging. For 64 nights, we captured 706 individuals of 33 Phyllostomidae species. Sampling time inﬂuenced total bat composition and phytophagous bat composition, both in logged and control sites. The time 9 site interaction inﬂuenced animalivorous bat composition and reduced the abundance and richness of animalivorous species in RIL sites. Sampling time, site, and the time 9 site interaction did not inﬂuence the number of species, total abundance, or phytophague abundance. The canopy was, on average, 3.4 times more open after the RIL and inﬂuenced animalivorous composition. Our results indicate that species sensitive to environmental changes, such as animalivorous bats, respond rapidly to forest logging. In more opportunistic guilds, such as phytophagues, the temporal change in the species composition in control and logged sites indicate that other temporal factors, besides logging, may have inﬂuenced bat assemblages. We suggest that RIL timber certiﬁcation stimulates the protection of primary forest without logging within the area under exploration, which is not the case in the area we studied. We also recommend the application of BACI designs and monitoring environmental metrics in RIL impact studies.",

Much of the decline in numbers of these species can be linked to a loss of bottomland hardwood forests throughout their range, resulting in a loss of natural roost structures in many areas. We characterized day roosts of both species and determined differences in characteristics of roost trees in western Tennessee. Radio transmitters were attached to adult females of both species to aid in locating new roosts. Thirty-one roost trees were identified, with most (93.5%) being large hollow water tupelos (Nyssa aquatica). Only two roost trees were used by both species during the survey period and no simultaneous roosting was documented. Roost trees in our study typically had triangular-shaped basal openings and large diameters (129.2 6 7.3 cm). A significant difference (P , 0.05) in roost-tree diameter was observed between trees used by the two bat species. Our study is the first to compare characteristics of tree roosts of sympatric populations of Rafinesque’s big-eared bats and southeastern myotis. Results suggest that these species may have different preferences for roost trees.",

            "abstractNote": "The high levels of biodiversity in the Amazon are maintained mostly due to its composition as a natural mosaic of different habitats, including both unflooded and flooded forests, campinaranas, and savannahs. Here, we compared multiple dimensions of α- and β- bat biodiversity between four natural Amazonian habitats (savannah, campinarana, forest patches, and continuous forest). In addition, we explored the extent to which bat communities in the different habitats are nested within one another, and compared the community-level functional uniqueness and community-weighted mean traits between habitats. Our results show that taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic α-diversity of bats is higher in continuous forest than in any of the other habitat types. The continuous forest also harbours more unique species, and indeed, the bat community assemblages in the less-complex habitats, including forest patches, campinarana and savannahs, are taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic sub-sets of the assemblage found in the continuous forest. By examining β-diversity partitions and species composition, we are able to shed light on the mechanisms behind the variation in diversity between the four habitat types, which reflect a process of environmental sorting along a habitat gradient going from a more complex to a less complex habitat. We conclude that nesting patterns along the mosaic of habitats are determined by differences in complexity between habitats and that taxonomic and functional uniqueness contribute to overall regional bat diversity and functionality. Ongoing human-induced disturbances of these habitats could provoke an unprecedented loss of bat diversity and functionality with negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services.",

New host and distribution records are given for two additional known species of Striopsylla: S. rugata (Jordan, 1937) and S. vandeuseni Holland, 1969. A generic diagnosis is provided, host/parasite relationships are discussed for all species of Striopsylla examined, and a key is provided for all known species of Striopsylla. Miscellaneous records of other flea species belonging to the genera Acanthopsylla Jordan and Rothschild, 1922, Papuapsylla Holland, 1969, and Pygiopsylla Rothschild, 1906, are provided. Pygiopsylla spinata Holland, 1969, is proposed as a junior synonym of Pygiopsylla hoplia Jordan and Rothschild, 1922. With the addition of three newly described species, 78 species of Pygiopsylloidea and eight other species [Ischnopsyllidae (3), Pulicidae (3), and Leptopsyllidae (2)] are documented in Papua Province, Indonesia (West Papua) and Papua New Guinea.",

A collection of 87 ﬂeas was obtained. They included eight species representing seven genera and four families: Dasypsyllus gallinulae gallinulae (Dale), Macrostylophora jiangkouensis Li and Huang (Ceratophyllidae); Palaeopsylla incurva Jordan, Palaeopsylla remota Jordan (Ctenophthalmidae); Nycteridopsylla iae Beaucournu and Kock, Thaumapsylla breviceps Rothschld (Ischnopsyllidae); and Aviostivalius klossi Jordan and Rothschild, and Lentistivalius insolli Traub (Pygiopsyllidae). Illustrations are provided to supplement those in the original description of M. jiangkouensis. The host preference for L. insolli for passerine birds is established with certainty and its derivation and distribution are discussed. The potential impact of predatory ants on ﬂea populations at low elevations in tropical latitudes is considered.",

The morphological differences in these two species are striking; however, a recent collection of male N. iae and female N. quadrispina from a single host individual of the Great Evening Bat (I. io Thomas), led us to suspect that N. iae and N. quadrispina represented the same species. Morphological similarities were noted and male and female exemplars were sequenced using five genes (18S, 28S, 16S, 12S, and COII). Across the five sequenced genes from both specimens (male and female), sequence identity was 100%. Considering morphological characteristics and DNA analysis, N. quadrispina is indisputably a junior synonym of N. iae. Myanmar is a new country record for N. iae, Harpiocephalus harpia (Temminck) is a new host record for N. iae and the preferred host is the Great Evening Bat, I. io.",

Among this material, the new genus and species Maabella stomalata is described. The dealate females of this new taxon from China were attached over the joints of the wings of Rhinolophus affinis Horsfield and Rhinolophus macrotis Blyth. They were also removed from the wings of Rhinolophus paradoxalophus (Bourret) and R. macrotis from Vietnam. Clarification of the relationships of the streblid genera Ascodipteron Adensamer, 1896, Maabella, and Paraascodipteron Advani and Vazirani, 1981 is discussed. Techniques are presented for the preparation and preservation of these small obligate parasites.",

            "abstractNote": "The Robert Traub collection of fleas is maintained in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. During the height of collecting fleas from the 1960s onward, many specimens were collected from Australia, Malaysia, and New Guinea and provided to Robert Traub. A plethora of publications resulted; however, Dr. Traub died before he could finish much of that work. Following his death, specimens were available that had never been fully studied, and in many cases, inadequately curated (alcohol material, unidentified slides, vials of dried up specimens, etc.). Following the in-depth reviews of 14 genera (published in six parts by the author), additional specimens were obtained from the Carnegie Museum. These additional specimens represented 32 species in nine flea families and are reported here for the first time. Many of the specimens included in this study, are supplementary specimens associated (but not reported) by Hastriter (2012) and in Hastriter’s six-part series (Parts I–VI) published between 2013 and 2021. Among the material was a new species of Bibikovana Traub, 1980, from Australia, Bibikovana acumena, that is closely related to Bibikovana colossus (Rothschild, 1906). This new taxon is described and illustrated. The ranges of five flea species are extended: 1) Porribius caminae (Rothschild, 1903) to Tasmania, 2) Neopsylla dispar Jordan, 1932, to the island of Borneo (State of Sabah, Malaysia), 3) Bibikovana engilisi Hastriter, 2021, to Papua New Guinea, 4) Pygiopsylla zethi (Rothschild, 1904) to Mole Creek and Bridport, Tasmania, and 5) Smitella thambetosa Traub, 1968, to Papua New Guinea. Eight new host records include: 1) Sigmactenus toxopeusi Smit, 1953, on Rattus giluwensis Hill, 1960, 2) Stephanocircus pectinipes Rothschild, 1915, on Pseudomys novaehollandiae (Waterhouse, 1843), 3) Stephanocircus simsoni Rothschild, 1905, on Pseudomys higginsi Trouessart, 1897, 4) Bibikovana engilisi Hastriter, 2021 on Microperoryctes papuensis (Laurie, 1952), 5) Parastivalius gressitti Holland, 1969 on Mi. papuensis, 6) Rectidigitus glomerospinosus Hastriter, 2016 on Cercartetus caudatus (Milne-Edwards, 1877), 7) Rectidigitus traubi Holland, 1969, in a Mi. papuensis nest, and 8) Smitella thambetosa Traub, 1968 on Mammelomys rattoides (Thomas, 1922). Host data supporting the primary host of Choristopsylla ochi (Rothschild, 1904) was presented and determined to be Trichosurus vulpecula (Kerr, 1792). Host associations are discussed for each species and a list of hosts and respective flea species are provided.",

            "abstractNote": "The genus Glauconycteris Dobson, 1875 currently contains 12 species of butterfly bats, all endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. Most species are rarely recorded, with half of the species known from less than six geographic localities. The taxonomic status of several species remains problematic. Here, we studied the systematics of butterfly bats using both morphological and molecular approaches. We examined 45 adult specimens for external anatomy and skull morphology, and investigated the phylogeny of Glauconycteris using DNA sequences from three mitochondrial genes and 116 individuals, which in addition to outgroup taxa, included nine of the twelve butterfly bat species currently recognized. Four additional nuclear genes were sequenced on a reduced sample of 69 individuals, covering the outgroup and Glauconycteris species. Our molecular results show that the genus Glauconycteris is monophyletic, and that it is the sister-group of the Asian genus Hesperoptenus. Molecular dating estimates based on either Cytb or RAG2 data sets suggest that the ancestor of Glauconycteris migrated into Africa from Asia during the Tortonian age of the Late Miocene (11.6–7.2 Mya), while the basal diversification of the crown group occurred in Africa at around 6 ± 2 Mya. The species G. superba is found to be the sister-group of G. variegata, questioning its placement in the recently described genus Niumbaha. The small species living in tropical rainforests constitute a robust clade, which contains three divergent lineages: (i) the “poensis” group, which is composed of G. poensis, G. alboguttata, G. argentata, and G. egeria; (ii) the “beatrix” group, which contains G. beatrix and G. curryae; and (iii) the “humeralis” group, which includes G. humeralis and a new species described herein. In the “poensis” group, G. egeria is found to be monophyletic in the nuclear tree, but polyphyletic in the mitochondrial tree. The reasons for this mito-nuclear discordance are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Members of the family Pteropodidae, also known as Old World fruit bats, are represented in Africa by 14 genera and 44 species. Here, we sequenced 67 complete mitochondrial genomes from African and Asian pteropodids to better understand the evolutionary history of the subfamily Rousettinae, which includes most of the African species. An increased frequency of guanine to adenine transitions is detected in the mtDNA genomes of Macroglossus sobrinus and all species of Casinycteris and Scotonycteris. Our phylogenetic and molecular dating analyses based on 126 taxa and 15,448 characters indicate a low signal for deep relationships within the family, suggesting a rapid diversification during the Late Oligocene period of “warming.” Within the subfamily Rousettinae, most nodes are highly supported by our different analyses (all nucleotide sites, SuperTRI analyses of a sliding window, transversions only, coding genes only, and amino acid sequences). The results indicate the existence of four tribes: Rousettini—distributed from Africa through Mediterranean region and South Asia to South-East Asia; Eonycterini—found in Asia; and Epomophorini and Scotonycterini—restricted to sub-Saharan Africa. Although most interspecies relationships are highly supported, three parts of the Rousettinae mitochondrial tree are still unresolved, suggesting rapid diversification: (a) among the three subtribes Epomophorina (Epomophorus sensu lato, i.e., including Micropteropus, Epomops, Hypsignathus, Nanonycteris), Plerotina (Plerotes), and Myonycterina (Myonycteris, Megaloglossus) in the Late Miocene; (b) among Epomops, Hypsignathus, and other species of Epomophorina at the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary; and (c) among Myonycteris species in the Early Pleistocene. Within the Epomophorini, Stenonycteris lanosus emerged first, suggesting that lingual echolocation may have appeared in the common ancestor of Epomophorini and Rousettini. Our analyses suggest that multiple events of mtDNA introgression occurred within the Epomophorus species complex during the Pleistocene.",

            "abstractNote": "We examined the potential for urban water sources, specifically golf course ponds, to act as centers for rabies transmission from bats to mesocarnivores in the arid southwestern United States where surface water is often limited. Because residential housing can act as den and roost sites for both mesocarnivores and bats, we also examined the effect of housing density around water sources on activity. Using ultrasonic acoustic recorders to assess bat activity and camera traps to estimate mesocarnivore activity, we compared 14 pairs of wet and dry locations over two years by surveying twice during the summer, once prior to summer monsoons and once during the monsoon season, when surface waters were more available. Number of calls for all bat species combined were greater at wet sites compared to dry sites and calls of two bat species often associated with rabies, big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) and silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans), were recorded more at wet sites than dry sites in the monsoon season. In both years, raccoons (Procyon lotor) were photographed more often at wet sites while striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) were less likely to be detected at wet sites. Bat, fox and raccoon activity was not associated with housing density while striped skunks showed a positive correlation. Finally, we examined potential for contact between mesocarnivores and big brown bats, a species implicated in cross-species rabies transmission in our area, by combining call activity of this bat species and photo detections of mesocarnivores during individual hours of the night into a Potential Contact Index (PCI) and found no significant effect of season (pre-monsoon vs. monsoon), species, or treatment (dry versus wet) but did find a significant species by treatment interaction, with raccoon PCI 3–30 times higher at wet sites and no effect on the other two mesocarnivores’ PCI. Overall, we found higher activity of bats at urban waters could increase potential for cross-species transmission of rabies from bats to raccoons but not for gray foxes and striped skunks.",

To date, viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in four bat species: Rhinolophus acuminatus, Rhinolophus affinis, Rhinolophus malayanus, and Rhinolophus shameli. Here, we analysed 343 sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (CO1) from georeferenced bats of the four Rhinolophus species identified as reservoirs of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Haplotype networks were constructed in order to investigate patterns of genetic diversity among bat populations of Southeast Asia and China. No strong geographic structure was found for the four Rhinolophus species, suggesting high dispersal capacity. The ecological niche of bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 was predicted using the four localities in which bat viruses were recently discovered and the localities where bats showed the same CO1 haplotypes than virus-positive bats. The ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV was deduced from the localities where bat viruses were previously detected. The results show that the ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV2 includes several regions of mainland Southeast Asia whereas the ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV is mainly restricted to China. In agreement with these results, human populations in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand appear to be much less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than other countries of Southeast Asia. In the climatic transitional zone between the two ecological niches (southern Yunnan, northern Laos, northern Vietnam), genomic recombination between highly divergent viruses is more likely to occur. Considering the limited data and the risk of recombinant bat-CoVs emergence as the source of new pandemics in humans, the bat populations in these regions should be under surveillance.",

            "abstractNote": "Both Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus were detected in several fruit bat species of the family Pteropodidae, suggesting that this taxon plays a key role in the life cycle of filoviruses. After four decades of Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) outbreaks in Central Africa, the virus was detected for the first time in West Africa in 2014. To better understand the role of fruit bats as potential reservoirs and circulating hosts between Central and West Africa, we examine here the phylogeny and comparative phylogeography of Pteropodidae. Our phylogenetic results confirm the existence of four independent lineages of African fruit bats: the genera Eidolon and Rousettus, and the tribes Epomophorini and Scotonycterini, and indicate that the three species suspected to represent ZEBOV reservoir hosts (Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, and Myonycteris torquata) belong to an African clade that diversified rapidly around 8-7 Mya. To test for phylogeographic structure and for recent gene flow from Central to West Africa, we analysed the nucleotide variation of 675 cytochrome b gene (Cytb) sequences, representing eight fruit bat species collected in 48 geographic localities. Within Epomophorina, our mitochondrial data do not support the monophyly of two genera (Epomops and Epomophorus) and four species (Epomophorus gambianus, Epomops franqueti, Epomops buettikoferi, and Micropteropus pusillus). In Epomops, however, we found two geographic haplogroups corresponding to the Congo Basin and Upper Guinea forests, respectively. By contrast, we found no genetic differentiation between Central and West African populations for all species known to make seasonal movements, Eidolon helvum, E. gambianus, H. monstrosus, M. pusillus, Nanonycteris veldkampii, and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Our results suggest that only three fruit bat species were able to disperse directly ZEBOV from the Congo Basin to Upper Guinea: E. helvum, H. monstrosus, and R. aegyptiacus.",

Our study examined whether MPTP-treated echolocation bats can cause changes in bat echolocation system. By considering ultrasound spectrums, auditory brainstem-evoked potentials and flight trajectories of normal bats, we observed that the vocal, auditory, orientation and movement functions of MPTP-treated bats were significantly impaired, and they exhibited various symptoms resembling those in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Our immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses further indicated that expression of vocal-related FOXP2 in the superior colliculus, auditory-related otoferlin in the inferior colliculus, dopamine synthesis-related aromatic\n              l\n              -amino acid decarboxylase in the substantia nigra and dopamine receptor in the striatum was significantly decreased. Furthermore, protein expression related to inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in the substantia nigra was significantly increased in MPTP-treated bats. These results indicate that inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis may be instrumental in dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. The vocal, auditory and orientation and movement dysfunctions of MPTP-treated bats are relatively consistent with symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.",
