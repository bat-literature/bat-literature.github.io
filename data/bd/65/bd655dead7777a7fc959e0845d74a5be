We compared bat activity in Monterrey pine plantations with and without an understory in central Chile. Total activity did not differ between plantations with a developed understory and those without it, being higher on-track than off-tracks sites. Trails provide commuting areas for bats within plantations allowing its use regardless of their degree of structural clutter. Promoting understory in plantations provides habitats for bats and might enhance their conservation in human-modified landscapes.",

With the escalating impacts of climate change, a comprehensive understanding of the environmental factors influencing bat activity becomes imperative for their conservation in agricultural landscapes. This study investigates the influence of weather conditions, specifically air temperature and relative humidity, on the timing activity and the relative abundance of five insectivorous bat species in central Chile. Data from automatic bat detectors and climatological stations are utilized for analysis. Our results unveil species-specific behaviors, with Tadarida brasiliensis exhibiting early emergence and extended activity periods compared to other bat species. Histiotus montanus and Lasiurus villosissimus display delayed onsets on more humid evenings, whereas Lasiurus varius and T. brasiliensis initiate activity earlier on colder nights compared to warmer ones. Relative humidity emerges as a key factor influencing relative abundance for all species, with more minutes with bat passes detected on drier nights. These findings suggest that global warming may influence observed bat behaviors, potentially altering foraging patterns and activity levels of these bat species. Moreover, as climate change continues, understanding the long-term impact on bat populations and their adaptive strategies is crucial for effective conservation measures. Further studies exploring these dynamics can provide valuable insights for shaping conservation efforts in the face of evolving environmental challenges.",

Recognizing the importance of bats to suppress pest populations and further conserve their populations near agricultural systems could reduce damage to crops thereby potentially increasing the monetary gain of farmers. Viticulture represents one of the most extensive and economically important agricultural crops in the Mediterranean biome. While pest consumption by bats has been recently revealed in vineyards, direct evidence of the reduction of grapevine pests by bats in vineyards is lacking, and their beneﬁts to winegrape production remains to be quantiﬁed. Using large nocturnal exclosures in vineyards, we examined the top-down eﬀects of aerial insectivorous bats in suppressing insect populations by assessing leaf and grape cluster damage; we also examined the beneﬁt of these natural pest predators by quantifying resulting increases in potential vineyard yield. Grapevine plants excluded from bats had signiﬁcantly higher leaf herbivory and greater grape cluster damage than control plots. Grape cluster damage was 7% lower on control plots, yielding an average economic beneﬁt of US$188-$248/ha/year due to bat predation. These results provide the ﬁrst experimental evidence that bats reduce grapevine pest insect infections and thus increase vineyard yield and winegrowers’ income. Therefore, bats should be included in future biodiversity conservation plans in vineyards and be considered within agricultural management strategies based on natural pest suppression.",

La morfología externa y craneana de la especie fue homogénea y el análisis de dimorfismo sexual secundario de las poblaciones de la región Pacífico no mostró diferencias significativas, sin embargo la longitud de la tibia y la profundidad de la caja craneana son proporcionalmente mayores en los machos y el ancho zigomático en las hembras.

However, nectar-feeding bats do not exhibit preferences for the sugars present in their diet. We analyzed the role that biochemical and ecological factors could play in shaping the nectar traits of chiropterophilic plants. We studied nectar traits and ﬂower production in 49 plant species. We evaluated the relationship between nectar concentration and sugar composition using phylogenetically independent contrasts and if nectar traits were related to ﬂower production using a Manova. We found that 42 species produced high hexoses nectars, and 7 species produced sucrose rich nectars. Phylogenetically independent contrasts showed that nectar concentration was negatively related to glucose content, positively related to fructose content, and was not related to sucrose content. A negative relationship was found from glucose and fructose contents to sucrose content, and glucose content was negatively related to fructose content. Finally, we did not found any relationship between nectar traits and the plants’ ﬂowering strategies. We conclude that bat physiology and the relative low evolutionary time of the interaction between plants and bats may determine the lack of pattern in the nectar characteristics of chiropterophilic plants.",

Leptonycteris yerbabuenae (20 g mass) were injected with or fed inert carbohydrate probes L-rhamnose and D(+)-cellobiose, which are absorbed exclusively by the paracellular route, and 3-O-methyl-Dglucose (3OMD-glucose), which is absorbed both paracellularly and transcellularly. Using a standard pharmacokinetic technique, we collected blood samples for 2 h after probe administration. As predicted, fractional absorption ( f ) of paracellular probes declined with increasing Mr in the order of rhamnose ( f=0.71)>cellobiose ( f=0.23). Absorption of 3OMD-glucose was complete ( f=0.85; not different from unity). Integrating our data with those for glucose absorption and oxidation in another nectarivorous bat, we conclude that passive paracellular absorption of glucose is extensive in nectarivorous bat species, as in other bats and small birds, and necessary to support high glucose fluxes hypothesized for the sugar oxidation cascade.",

In this contribution, we extend the known distribution of P. leucoptera 260 km NE and P. pallidoptera 290 km NE. Our records are from three specimens collected in a mammal assessment at the riparian corridor of the river Meta in the Vichada department. This locality is the northern limit of the distributional range of both species. We highlight the need to continue the fieldwork on mammals inventories with specimen collections through the Colombian Llanos. We call attention to the importance of horizontal rotten logs as roost of P. leucoptera and other little known neotropical bats.",

The present study sought to determine the size of the home range of Myotis atacamensis and Amorphochilus schnablii in coastal valleys of Arequipa for the generation of efficient management and conservation plans. Both species are under some category of conservation (M. atacamensis, Endangered; A. schnablii, Vulnerable), due to loss of extension and quality of habitat in their distribution area, in addition to the limited knowledge of them. In 2019, Holohil LB-2X VHF radio transmitters were installed on 12 individuals, obtaining bat’s positions using the homing-in-the-animal method. The size of the home range (HR) was estimated with the methods: convex minimum polygon and bivariate kernel function. The HR size for M. atacamensis was 2.1 ± 1.6 ha on cultivated areas, and for A. shnablii it was 24.2 ± 27.1 ha on arid zones and cultivated areas. The results suggest that the use of spaces of M. atacamensis and A. schnablii are mainly oriented to the availability of food, registering greater importance of the cultivation areas in the home range.",

Furthermore, the microclimate of roosts is a crucial element for bat survival, and modified leaves are used for roosting (“tents”) by 22 species of bats. Our objective was to determine whether the inverted boat tents used by Ectophylla alba and pinnate tents used by Uroderma bilobatum provide energetic benefits. We measured the ambient temperature under modified and unmodified leaves (UMLs) of Heliconia imbricata and Cocos nucifera . We also measured temperature with (simulated bat presence) and without a heat source, and finally we measured bat energy expenditure at different temperatures. Our results show that when a heat source is present tents conserve heat better than a UML. The energy expenditure of E. alba and U. bilobatum increased up to 55% and 48%, respectively, with a decrease of temperature from 25°C to 20°C. We concluded that since the temperature at our study site drops below 25°C every night and remains that way until mid-morning, using a “tent” that maintains a temperature higher than ambient temperature, or close to 25°C degrees, provides an energetic advantage.\n            La selección del refugio en los mamíferos es una presión selectiva importante y muchos animales encuentran refugio en estructuras ya existentes. El microclima del refugio es un elemento crucial para la sobrevivencia de los murciélagos. Las hojas modificadas (tiendas) son utilizadas por 22 especies de murciélagos. Nuestro objetivo era determinar si la tienda de bote invertido utilizada por Ectophylla alba y tiendas pinnadas utilizadas por Uroderma bilobatum brindan un beneficio energético a los murciélagos. Se midió la temperatura bajo hojas modificadas y no modificadas de Heliconia imbricata y Cocos nucifera . Además se midió la temperatura con fuente (simulando la presencia de murciélagos) y sin fuente de calor, finalmente se midió el gasto energético de los murciélagos a diferentes temperaturas. Los resultados muestran que cuando hay una fuente de calor presente, la tienda conserva el calor mejor que una hoja no modificada. El gasto energético de E. alba y U. bilobatum puede incrementarse hasta 55% y 48%, respectivamente, cuando la temperatura decrece entre 25°C y 20°C. Concluimos que como la temperatura en este sitio de estudio baja de los 25°C cada noche y hasta media mañana, utilizar una tienda que mantiene la temperatura arriba o cerca de los 25°C, provee una ventaja energética.",

The species has a bizarrely wrinkled face and lacks the characteristic nose leaf. Throughout its distribution from Mexico to Northern South America the species is most of the time rarely captured and only scarce information on its behavior and natural history is available.\n              Centurio senex\n              is frugivorous and one of the few bats documented to consume also hard seeds. Interestingly, the species shows a distinct sexual dimorphism: Adult males have more pronounced facial wrinkles than females and a fold of skin under the chin that can be raised in style of a face mask. We report the first observations on echolocation and mating behavior of\n              Centurio senex\n              , including synchronized audio and video recordings from an aggregation of males in Costa Rica. Over a period of 6 weeks we located a total of 53 perches, where during the first half of the night males were hanging with raised facial masks at a mean height of 2.35 m. Most of the time, the males moved just their wing tips, and spontaneously vocalized in the ultrasound range. Approaches of other individuals resulted in the perching male beating its wings and emitting a very loud, low frequency whistling call. Following such an encounter we recorded a copulation event. The observed aggregation of adult\n              C\n              .\n              senex\n              males is consistent with lek courtship, a behavior described from only few other bat species.",

Based on published data, new descriptions and reports, we here present an updated list of all terrestrial and aquatic Costa Rican mammals. We summarize available information on their status, and present our concerns regarding those species with populations under alarming conditions. The mammalian fauna of Costa Rica is mainly Neotropical. A total of 238 species, grouped in 140 genera and 44 families, were documented. The order Chiroptera is the most diverse, followed by Rodentia, Cetacea, and Carnivora. About 7% of the species are endemic to Costa Rica (or Costa Rica-Nicaragua, Costa Rica-Panamá). Unfortunately, despite of all the efforts to protect our fauna and flora, threat to Costa Rican mammals is increasing, and a number of species have gone, and are going extinct. As in most other areas, habitat loss, both in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, poses the greatest threat to mammalian diversity of Costa Rica. Other factors, such as poaching, inappropriate gear used in fisheries, and other human exploitation are also threatening mammal populations in Costa Rica. Future conservation efforts should focus on more detailed conservation and management strategies, particularly of large mammals (e.g. monkeys, felids).",

            "abstractNote": "Bats show the greatest variety of mating strategies in mammals. Social structure can be influenced by roost characteristics, for example, if the roost is defendable and its availability limited, it becomes an important resource that partially determines the mating system type. In the species that use tents as roosting sites, it has been suggested that males can defend the tent in order to attract and have access to females. Ectophylla alba is an obligate and exclusive tent user, and it has to build tents periodically. Its mating system has been classified as polygyny by its resource defense, and it has a temporary group structure of one male and several females. This study seeks to determine the composition and stability of the groups of this species and to learn whether males defend the tent or the females in it in order to gain copulations. This study was conducted in 2006 in Tirimbina, Biological Reserve in Sarapiquí, Costa Rica, where groups of bats were captured (N = 38). The individuals were marked (N = 98), and their reproductive status was determined. The behavior of the individuals was recorded with video cameras and infrared light (300 h total). Throughout the year, some individuals were more closely associated to other individuals, determining that groups are stable independent of the reproductive season. The proportion of males in the groups does not vary according to reproductive season, and in most groups, there is more than one adult male. The males spend different amounts of time in the tents and do not show antagonistic behavior with other members of the group. Based on the social structure, the classification of the mating system should change to Ba stable group of several males and females,^ which may be confirmed in the near future by the results of an ongoing paternity study.",

            "abstractNote": "We examined the assemblage of bats in a fragmented landscape along the northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico, West Indies, by mist netting and acoustic monitoring over a period of 25 months. Twelve of the 13 species present in the region were detected. It took nine nights of net and acoustic monitoring to detect 69% of the species, and 44 nights to reach 92%. Diversity was high, considering the insular nature of the assemblage and the fragmented nature of the ecosystem. We did not detect any important seasonal pattern in bat activity. The fruit eating bats at this study site are important importers of various seeds. Artibeus jamaicensis was most frequently captured and it appears to breed throughout the year at this location. Our results have important implications for management and conservation of biological diversity on tropical islands, and set a baseline against which the effect of further urban encroachment can be compared.",

These roosts may function as shelter from weather or predators, information and social centers, or as nurseries. We provide estimates of bat population from 12 hot caves in Puerto Rico, based on infrared reflectance technology. Populations ranged from a few thousands of individuals to several hundred thousand. At nine caves, estimates were performed twice at different periods during the reproductive cycle. Some caves showed notable variations in the size of the population. A database of caves used by bats throughout the island is also provided, as well as information on the species that have been identified at each cave.",

Data on seasonality of fatalities and distance of carcasses from turbines is also provided. Eleven out of the 13 species of bats in Puerto Rico suffered fatalities, including all five species of phyllostomids. These were: Molossus molossus and Tadarida brasiliensis (Molossidae); Artibeus jamaicensis, Monophyllus redmani, Stenoderma rufum, Brachyphylla cavernarum and Erophylla bombifrons (Phyllostomidae); Noctilio leporinus (Noctilionidae); Eptesicus fuscus and Lasiurus minor (Vespertilionidae); and Mormoops blainvillei (Mormoopidae).

The specimen referred here was compared with cranial materials of other Cuban bats, with analysis of qualitative and quantitative characters, as well as with measurements, photos, and existing drawings in the bibliography. This nataleid is currently extirpated in most of the Cuban territory, with only a relict population in a cave in the western end of the archipelago. The present finding of N. primus demonstrates the diversity of Chiroptera that once existed in the region where the fossil deposit treated here is located.",

            "abstractNote": "Several hypotheses attempt to explain the latitudinal gradient of species diversity, but some basic aspects of the pattern remain insufficiently explored, including the effect of scales and the role of beta diversity. To explore such components of the latitudinal gradient, we tested the hypothesis of covariation, which states that the gradient of species diversity should show the same pattern regardless of the scale of analysis. The hypothesis implies that there should be no gradients of beta diversity, of regional range size within regions, and of the slope of the species‐area curve. For the fauna of North American mammals, we found contrasting results for bats and non‐volant species. We could reject the hypothesis of covariation for non‐volant mammals, for which the number of species increases towards lower latitudes, but at different rates depending on the scale. Also, for this group, beta diversity is higher at lower latitudes, the regional range size within regions is smaller at lower latitudes, and z, the slope of the species‐area relationship is higher at lower latitudes. Contrarily bats did not show significant deviations from the predictions of the hypothesis of covariation: at two different scales, species richness shows similar trends of increase at lower latitudes, and no gradient can be demonstrated for beta diversity, for regional range size, or for the slopes of the species‐area curve. Our results show that the higher diversity of non‐volant mammals in tropical areas of North America is a consequence of the increase in beta diversity and not of higher diversity at smaller scales. In contrast, the diversity of bats at both scales is higher at lower latitudes. These contrasting patterns suggest different causes for the latitudinal gradient of species diversity in the two groups that are ultimately determined by differences in the patterns of geographic distribution of the species.",

            "abstractNote": "The gular gland is a skin gland located in the suprasternal region of adult males of some bat families. Knowledge of the morphology and functional aspects of these gland types is often limited. This study aimed to describe the structure and composition of the gular glands of three molossid species (Eumops patagonicus, Molossus fluminensis and Molossus molossus) with respect to their reproductive activity and to define the mechanism involved in secretion release. Different histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques were used to achieve these goals. The results revealed that the size and composition of this gland are variable and are mostly related to the lipid content during the reproductive season. The results also documented, for the first time, the occurrence of mechanoreceptors associated with the surface of the glandular duct by detecting an S100 protein, indicating that an external stimulus activates secretion. Previous studies on other species have classified the gland using obsolete criteria; hence, we adopted a new classification of adenomeres in this study. Moreover, we investigated the gland secretion mechanism previously proposed. This study defines the implications of this gland in the reproduction of this species. Our preliminary interpretation of the function of the gular gland is that it is a cutaneous exocrine gland activated by mechanoreceptors involved in the reproductive behaviour of the Molossidae family.",

The virus is distributed worldwide and is primarily transmitted by rabid animal bites, with multiple reservoirs depending on the region. The vampire bat Desmodus rotundus is distributed in several states of Mexico and is considered the main vector of rabies in cattle. In the state of Baja California, no cases of paralytic rabies have been reported. In this work, we report the first three cases of rabies in feedlot cattle showing nervous signs, which were later confirmed in a reference laboratory by immunofluorescent analysis. Considering that the majority of feedlot cattle are introduced to Baja California from other states of Mexico where rabies is considered endemic, it is necessary to strengthen current programs of vaccination to reduce the rate of infected animals in their places of origin to avoid the spread of rabies to other geographic areas of the country.",

Results: there was a marked reduction in the number of vaccinated dogs, from 105,764 (2004) to 65,561 (2014), with vaccine coverage below 80%, except in 2004; there was little oscillation in the number of vaccinated cats, from 10,212 (2004) to 9,522 (2014), with vaccine coverage below 80%, except in 2014; 4,464 bats were collected by passive surveillance, 2.17% of them were positive for rabies. Conclusion: the low vaccine coverage in dogs and cats and the circulation of the virus in bats imposes the need for improvement in surveillance actions, in order to prevent cases of human rabies.",

            "abstractNote": "Trypanosoma spp. infection in wild mammals is detected mainly through parasitological tests that usually display low sensitivity. We propose the use of DNA extracted directly from blood clots (BC), which are neglected sources of DNA for diagnosis and identiﬁcation of Trypanosoma spp. This approach followed by nested PCR targeting the 18S SSU rDNA demonstrated to be sensitive and suitable to evaluate the diversity of trypanosomes infecting sylvatic mammals, including subpatent and mixed infections. Infection was detected in 95/120 (79.2%) samples from bats, carnivores and marsupials that included negative serological and hemoculture testing mammals. Thirteen Trypanosoma spp. or Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) were identiﬁed, including two new MOTUs. The high diversity of trypanosomes species and MOTUs infecting bats and marsupials showed that these hosts can be considered as bio-accumulators of Trypanosoma spp., with specimens of Didelphis spp. displaying the highest trypanosome diversity. The use of blood clots allowed direct access to non-culturable parasites, mixed infections, besides bypassing the selective pressure on the parasites inherent to cultivation procedures. Trypanosoma cruzi was the species found infecting the highest number of individuals, followed by T. lainsoni. Positive PCR for T. cruzi was observed in 16 seronegative individuals and 30 individuals with negative hemocultures. Also, T. lainsoni, previously found only in rodents, showed to be capable of infecting bats and marsupials. This ﬁnding makes it clear that some species of Trypanosoma are more generalist than previously thought. Molecular diagnosis using nested PCR from DNA extracted from BC allowed the increase of the knowledge about host-spectrum and distribution of Trypanosoma spp. and allowed the identiﬁcation of new MOTUs.",

We obtained a large dataset of recoveries of ringed Miniopterus schreibersii to study the patterns and drivers of migration of a Mediterranean cave-dwelling bat. In spite of the mildness of Mediterranean winters, in average years bats hibernated, and few movements were recorded during this period. After hibernation, females migrated to spring roosts, and again to maternity roosts just before parturition. This late arrival at nurseries could be a strategy to avoid a harmful build-up of parasites. Soon after the juveniles were weaned, the mothers migrated to the roosts where they spent autumn and sometimes also winter. Juveniles remained in the warm nurseries longer, presumably because high roost temperatures speed up growth. The pattern of migration of males was similar to that of females, but they left hibernacula later and remained more mobile during the maternity season. They also arrived at the hibernacula later, possibly because they needed time to build up fat stores after the energetically costly mating season. Maternity colonies spent the yearly cycle in welldeﬁned home ranges (mean = 19 030 km2), which overlapped greatly. Bats were furthest from the maternity sites during hibernation, but even then 80% remained within 90 km of them. Each hibernaculum attracted bats from multiple nurseries, from within a mean range of 10 770 km2. We tested two potential drivers for migration – temperature in the roosts and at the foraging areas – but our results supported only the ﬁrst one. Bats migrated to reach the roosts most thermally suited for each phase of their life cycle, indicating that roost temperature and associated metabolic advantages are key drivers for regional migrations of cavedwelling bats.",

Both species presented 2n = 32, with the autosome complement composed of 30 bi-armed in P. discolor and 28 biarmed plus 1 acrocentric in P. hastatus. In both species, the X chromosome is medium submetacentric while the Y is minute acrocentric. The present study found only one difference between the karyotypes of P. discolor and P. hastatus: the smallest autosome (pair 15) is bi-armed in discolor and acrocentric in hastatus, a result best explained by pericentric inversion. The C-banding revealed constitutive heterochromatin only at the centromeric regions of all chromosomes, with the NOR site located at the distal region of short arm of pair 15, in both species. The taxon P. discolor is considered primitive for genus Phyllostomus and the bi-armed form of pair 15 is the assumed primitive condition which, rearranged by a pericentric inversion originated the acrocentric form found in P. hastatus.",

            "abstractNote": "Acoustic surveys are widely used for describing bat occurrence and activity patterns and are increasingly important for addressing concerns for habitat management, wind energy, and disease on bat populations. Designing these surveys presents unique challenges, particularly when a probabilistic sample is required for drawing inference to unsampled areas. Sampling frame errors and other logistical constraints often require survey sites to be dropped from the sample and new sites added. Maintaining spatial balance and representativeness of the sample when these changes are made can be problematic. Spatially balanced sampling designs recently developed to support aquatic surveys along rivers provide solutions to a number of practical challenges faced by bat researchers and allow for sample site additions and deletions, support unequal-probability selection of sites, and provide an approximately unbiased local neighborhood-weighted variance estimator that is efﬁcient for spatially structured populations such as is typical for bats. We implemented a spatially balanced design to survey canyon bat (Parastrellus hesperus) activity along a stream network. The spatially balanced design accommodated typical logistical challenges and yielded a 25% smaller estimated standard error for the mean activity level than the usual simple random sampling estimator. Spatially balanced designs have broad application to bat research and monitoring programs and will improve studies relying on model-based inference (e.g., occupancy models) by providing ﬂexibility and protection against violations of the independence assumption, even if design-based estimators are not used. Our approach is scalable and can be used for pre- and post-construction surveys along wind turbine arrays and for regional monitoring programs. ß 2011 The Wildlife Society.",

We tested the utility of a suite of external morphological characteristics frequently cited in regional keys to differentiate the 2 species in the field. Forearm length, dorsal pelage sheen, ear color, and forehead slope were examined from 101 bats captured in central Oregon during 2002–2003. Post hoc genetic analysis was performed on tissue samples collected from the 101 bats to confirm identification. Forearm lengths overlapped considerably between species. Only 18% of M. yumanensis and 17% of M. lucifugus were correctly identified with probability ≥95% using forearm length alone. Pelage sheen, ear color, and forehead slope successfully identified 96%, 82%, and 77% of individual bats, respectively. When forearm length was considered together with other traits, identification rates ranged from 92% to 20%. Ability to correctly identify M. yumanensis was 2–6 times greater than for M. lucifugus. Pelage sheen was useful in our study; however, using this character required a subjective decision from the observer, and the result often contradicted other characters for species identification stated in regional keys. For these reasons, we recommend that morphological features be used judiciously and only as supportive criteria for field identification in combination with voucher echolocation calls and genetic confirmation.",

Integrating long‐term encounter surveys with multi‐season occupancy models provides a solution whereby inferences about changing occupancy probabilities and latent changes in abundance can be supported. When harnessed to a Bayesian inferential paradigm, this modeling framework offers flexibility for conservation programs that need to update prior model‐based understanding about at‐risk species with new data. This scenario is exemplified by a bat monitoring program in the Pacific Northwestern United States in which results from 8 years of surveys from 2003 to 2010 require updating with new data from 2016 to 2018. The new data were collected after the arrival of bat white‐nose syndrome and expansion of wind power generation, stressors expected to cause population declines in at least two vulnerable species, little brown bat (\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              ) and the hoary bat (\n              Lasiurus cinereus\n              ). We used multi‐season occupancy models with empirically informed prior distributions drawn from previous occupancy results (2003–2010) to assess evidence of contemporary decline in these two species. Empirically informed priors provided the bridge across the two monitoring periods and increased precision of parameter posterior distributions, but did not alter inferences relative to use of vague priors. We found evidence of region‐wide summertime decline for the hoary bat (\n              \n               = 0.86 ± 0.10) since 2010, but no evidence of decline for the little brown bat (\n              \n               = 1.1 ± 0.10). White‐nose syndrome was documented in the region in 2016 and may not yet have caused regional impact to the little brown bat. However, our discovery of hoary bat decline is consistent with the hypothesis that the longer duration and greater geographic extent of the wind energy stressor (collision and barotrauma) have impacted the species. These hypotheses can be evaluated and updated over time within our framework of pre–post impact monitoring and modeling. Our approach provides the foundation for a strategic evidence‐based conservation system and contributes to a growing preponderance of evidence from multiple lines of inquiry that bat species are declining.",

            "abstractNote": "North American bat populations face unprecedented threats from disease and rapid environmental change, requiring a commensurate strategic conservation response. Protected-­area networks have tremendous potential to support coordinated resource protection, disease surveillance, and population monitoring that could become a cornerstone of 21st-c­ entury bat conservation. To motivate this idea, we develop a macroecological perspective about bat diversity and associated conservation challenges and opportunities on U.S. National Park Service (NPS) lands. We compared occurrence records from parks against published range maps. Only 55 (19%) of parks reported as present ≥90% of the bat species expected based on range maps, highlighting the information-­gap challenge. Discrepancies suggest substantial under-­reporting and under-­sampling of bats on NPS lands; inadequate range maps and habitat specificity are implicated for some species. Despite these discrepancies, 50 species, including several range-­restricted and endangered taxa, were reported in at least one park unit, including those in the Caribbean and tropical Pacific. Species richness increased with park area at a rate (z) of ~0.1, a pattern confounded by covariation with latitude, elevation, and habitat. When accounting for these factors, richness decreased predictably at higher latitudes and increased at mid-e­ levations and with greater numbers of keystone underground habitat structures (caves and mines), reflecting a strong species–energy relationship. The inclusion of covariates that represented percentage of natural vs. human-­modified (converted) landscapes and elevation range—a proxy for environmental heterogeneity—was uninformative. White-­nose syndrome (WNS) presents a tremendous challenge to the NPS: All 12 species currently known to be affected by the disease or to host the causal fungus are represented in the NPS system. One hundred and twenty-­seven NPS parks are in counties currently or likely to become WNS-p­ ositive by 2026. All parks are expected to experience increasing temperatures in coming decades; forecasted climate change velocity is particularly high (>1 SD) for 50 parks. Seventeen parks are in the vicinity of high (>1 SD) wind turbine density. Based on these biogeographic patterns, we suggest ways to prioritize NPS parks for additional inventories, monitoring, and resource protection. Our results demonstrate how macroecology and bioinformatics together can guide strategic conservation capacity-­building among protected areas.",

A better ability to quantify bat population status and trend is urgently needed in order to develop effective conservation strategies. We used a Bayesian autoregressive approach to develop dynamic distribution models for Myotis lucifugus, the little brown bat, across a large portion of northwestern USA, using a four-year detection history matrix obtained from a regional monitoring program. This widespread and abundant species has experienced precipitous local population declines in northeastern USA resulting from the novel disease white-nose syndrome, and is facing likely range-wide declines. Our models were temporally dynamic and accounted for imperfect detection. Drawing on species–energy theory, we included measures of net primary productivity (NPP) and forest cover in models, predicting that M. lucifugus occurrence probabilities would covary positively along those gradients.",

We advance a model-based framework for making spatially explicit predictions about summertime distributions of bats from capture and acoustic surveys. Motivated by species-energy and life-history theory, our models describe hypotheses about spatio-temporal variation in bat distributions along environmental gradients and life-history attributes, providing a statistical basis for conservation decision-making.",

In 2002 and 2003 we searched for spotted bats along the John Day, Deschutes, and Crooked Rivers and at a remote dry canyon southeast of the city of Bend in central Oregon. The species was documented through the use of mist-nets, a bat detector, and recognition of audible spotted bat calls. Spotted bats were found at 11 locations in 6 Oregon counties. Nightly activity patterns of spotted bats were unpredictable. Spotted bats were found in 78% of search areas but on only 48% of survey nights. We observed spotted bats foraging above fields and low upland slopes adjacent to rivers and creeks and along the rims of cliffs. Estimated flying heights of spotted bats ranged from 3 m to 50 m aboveground. The species was difficult to capture and was captured only after considerable experimentation with methods and materials. Three spotted bats were captured toward the end of the project in 2003 and accounted for only 0.5% of all bats captured during the study. Although we attached radio transmitters to 2 spotted bats, we found no roost locations. We believe additional spotted bat surveys in Oregon are warranted, especially in higher-elevation habitats, but recommend that to increase their effectiveness, surveys accommodate the unique foraging behavior of the species.",

Here, we illustrate the advantages of a method of combining quartet trees to solve this dilemma. We apply the method to a data set of 640 proteinsequence alignments from 4 to 24 eutherian taxa, and obtain a global eutherian phylogeny. In agreement with recent studies, we identify three major super-ordinal clades. The first clade is Afrotheria, a cluster of endemic African mammals. The second clade is an emended Laurasiatheria, consisting of Cetartiodactyla (cetaceans, ruminants, hippopotamuses, pigs, and tylopods), Perissodactyla (horses and rhinoceroses), Carnivora, Pholidota (pangolins), Chiroptera (bats), and Erinaceidae (hedgehogs). A tentatively identified third clade consists of some archontans (primates, flying lemurs, and tree shrews) as well as lagomorphs and rodents. Evolutionary relations within these major clades are well resolved. We also show that nuclear encoded proteins resolve eutherian phylogeny better than complete mitochondria. Finally, our results demonstrate that combining quartet trees provides a major opportunity to resolve unevenly sampled complex phylogenies.",

            "abstractNote": "Recent range shifts towards higher latitudes have been reported for many animals and plants in the northern hemisphere, and are commonly attributed to changes in climate. Relatively little is known about such changes in the southern hemisphere, although it has been suggested that latitudinal distributions of the fruit-bats Pteropus alecto and Pteropus poliocephalus changed during the 20th century in response to climate change in eastern Australia. However, historical changes in these species distributions have not been examined systematically. In this study we obtained historical locality records from a wide range of sources (including banding and museum records, government wildlife databases and unpublished records), and ﬁltered them for reliability and spatial accuracy. The latitudinal distribution of each species was compared between eight time-periods (1843–1920, 1921–1950, ﬁve 10-year intervals between 1950 and 2000, and 2001–2007), using analyses of both the ﬁltered point data (P. alecto 870 records, P. poliocephalus 2506) and presence/absence data within 50 ¥ 50 km grid cells. The results do not support the hypothesis that either species range is shifting in a manner driven by climate change. First, neither the northern or southern range limits of P. poliocephalus (Mackay, Queensland and Melbourne, Victoria respectively) changed over time. Second, P. alecto’s range limit extended southward by 1168 km (approximately 10.5 degrees latitude) during the twentieth century (from approximately Rockhampton, Queensland to Sydney, New South Wales). Within this zone of southward expansion (25–29°S), the percentage of total records that were P. alecto increased from 8% prior to 1950 to 49% in the early 2000s, and local count data showed that its abundance increased from several hundred to more than 10 000 individuals at speciﬁc roost sites, as range expansion progressed. Pteropus alecto expanded southward at about 100 km/decade, compared with the 10–26 km/decade rate of isotherm change, and analyses of historical weather data show that the species consequently moved into recently-colder regions than it had previously occupied. Neither climate change nor habitat change could provide simple explanations to explain P. alecto’s observed rapid range shift. More generally, climate change should not be uncritically inferred as a primary driver of species range shifts without careful quantitative analyses.",

We evaluated the current mist-netting guidelines designed to determine presence or absence of endangered, Myotis sodalis (Indiana bat). This test was conducted in Deer Ridge Conservation Area (Lewis County, northeastern Missouri), an area known to have an abundance of Indiana bats, including several primary maternity colonies. We mist-netted according to recommended guidelines for Indiana bats for two consecutive nights at three different times during the reproductive season. Anabat II detectors were used in conjunction with mist nets to sample bat activity at the same locations. Captures and detections of Indiana bats and other species of bats varied substantially among the sampling periods. In addition, there was a significant decrease in number of Indiana bats captured with mist nets from night one to night two, although activity levels remained the same. Finally, our data show that augmenting mist nets with ultrasonic detectors can enhance the probability of determining the presence or absence of Indiana bats.",

During the ﬁrst 2 years, a high number of carcasses was found from mid-July to the end of October, indicating the need for some mitigation strategy. Based on the results of carcass searches, meteorological data and bat activity monitored at a weather mast and four wind turbine nacelles, mitigation measures were proposed. During the next 2 years, wind turbine curtailment was implemented in the high collision risk period based on critical wind speed thresholds varying from 5.0 to 6.5 ms−1. Estimation of a total number of bat fatalities was conducted with the GenEst software for each monitoring year. A 78% reduction in estimated number of fatalities was recorded indicating the eﬀectiveness of implemented measures.",

However, wildlife consumption in China is not only a potential source of disease but also a practice embedded in complex beliefs about health. This paper used survey data (N = 974) collected in China in June 2021 to examine attitudes and behaviors related to (a) wildlife consumption, (b) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and (c) zoonotic risk after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. 40.1% of respondents self-reported that they are less likely to consume wild animals since the outbreak of COVID-19. Respondents who used wildlife supplements for TCM, who believed in the beneﬁts of wild animal consumption and fresh slaughter of wildlife, and who had higher levels of agreement with the zoonotic origin of COVID-19 were more likely to report that they had decreased their wildlife consumption after the outbreak of COVID-19. Use of wildlife in TCM signiﬁcantly increased the odds that a respondent believed that COVID-19 was very likely zoonotic. We discuss how situating wildlife consumption within complex beliefs about health and disease can assist with protecting wildlife and public health in the wake of COVID-19.",
