            "abstractNote": "Here we report a late Holocene fossil-rich cave deposit from Cueva de los Nesofontes, Mayabeque Province, Cuba. The deposit’s formation and its fauna were studied through a multidisciplinary approach that included stable isotope analyses, radiocarbon chronology, and stratigraphy. Thousands of microvertebrate skeletal remains were recovered, representing a diverse land vertebrate fauna that included threatened and extinct species. The deposit is characterized by profuse Nesophontes remains due to raptor predation. Previously unreported last appearance dates (LADs) are provided for the extinct ‘island-shrew’ Nesophontes major, the bats Artibeus anthonyi, and Phyllops vetus. Radiocarbon (14C AMS) age estimates between ~1960 rcyr BP and the present were acquired for the assemblage. The presence of locally extinct species, including the endemic parakeet Psittacara eups, the flicker Colaptes cf. fernandinae, the bat Antrozous koopmani, and the eulipotyphlan Solenodon cubanus, suggests that these species had broader distributions in the near past. Isotope analyses and faunal composition indicate the previous presence of diverse habitats, including palm grove savannas and mixed woodlands near the cave. Isotopes also provide insight into the habitat and coexistence of the extinct bat Artibeus anthonyi and extant A. jamaicensis, the diet of Nesophontes major, and local paleoenvironmental conditions. Oxygen isotopes reveal an excursion suggestive of drier/colder local conditions between 660 and 770 AD. Our research further expands the understanding of Cuban Quaternary extinction episodes and provides data on the distribution and paleoecology of extinct taxa. It supports the conclusion that many Cuban extinct species survived well into the pre-Columbian late Holocene and retained wide distribution ranges until European colonization.",

But nothing is known about the genomic characteristics of pterosaurs, which took to the air over 70 Myr before birds and were the first group of vertebrates to evolve powered flight. Here, we estimate genome size for four species of pterosaurs and seven species of basal archosauromorphs using a Bayesian comparative approach. Our results suggest that small genomes commonly associated with flight in bats and birds also evolved in pterosaurs, and that the rate of genome-size evolution is proportional to genome size within amniotes, with the fastest rates occurring in lineages with the largest genomes. We examine the role that drift may have played in the evolution of genome size within tetrapods by testing for correlated evolution between genome size and body size, but find no support for this hypothesis. By contrast, we find evidence suggesting that a combination of adaptation and phylogenetic inertia best explains the correlated evolution of flight and genome-size contraction. These results suggest that small genome/cell size evolved prior to or concurrently with flight in pterosaurs. We predict that, similar to the pattern seen in theropod dinosaurs, genome-size contraction preceded flight in pterosaurs and bats.",

Collisions often occur with lighted objects, suggesting ambient light may deleteriously affect obstacle avoidance capabilities. We tested the hypothesis that free-flying bats may orient by vision when they collide with some obstacles. We additionally tested whether acoustic distractions, such as ‘‘distress calls’’ of other bats, contributed to probabilities of collision.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: To investigate the role of visual cues in the collisions of free-flying little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) with stationary objects, we set up obstacles in an area of high bat traffic during swarming. We used combinations of light intensities and visually dissimilar obstacles to verify that bats orient by vision. In early August, bats collided more often in the light than the dark, and probabilities of collision varied with the visibility of obstacles. However, the probabilities of collisions altered in mid to late August, coincident with the start of behavioural, hormonal, and physiological changes occurring during swarming and mating. Distress calls did not distract bats and increase the incidence of collisions.\nConclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that visual cues are more important for free-flying bats than previously recognized, suggesting integration of multi-sensory modalities during orientation. Furthermore, our study highlights differences between responses of captive and wild bats, indicating a need for more field experiments.",

The 3D trajectories are onedimensionally characterized as inverse curvature time series to allow for entropy calculations. In addition to a traditional formulation of information ﬂow between pair members, a path coupling hypothesis is pursued with time-delay modiﬁcations implemented in such a way as to not change the Markovianity of the process. With this modiﬁcation, we ﬁnd trends that suggest a leader-follower interaction between the front bat and the rear bat, although statistical signiﬁcance is not reached due in part to the small number of pairs considered.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: In the wild, frugivorous and nectarivorous bats often eat fermenting fruits and nectar, and thus may consume levels of ethanol that could induce inebriation. To understand if consumption of ethanol by bats alters their access to food and general survival requires examination of behavioural responses to its ingestion, as well as assessment of interspecific variation in those responses. We predicted that bats fed ethanol would show impaired flight and echolocation behaviour compared to bats fed control sugar water, and that there would be behavioural differences among species.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We fed wild caught Artibeus jamaicensis, A. lituratus, A. phaeotis, Carollia sowelli, Glossophaga soricina, and Sturnira lilium (Chiroptera, Phyllostomidae) sugar water (44 g of table sugar in 500 ml of water) or sugar water with ethanol before challenging them to fly through an obstacle course while we simultaneously recorded their echolocation calls. We used bat saliva, a non-invasive proxy, to measure blood ethanol concentrations ranging from 0 to .0.3% immediately before flight trials. Flight performance and echolocation behaviour were not significantly affected by consumption of ethanol, but species differed in their blood alcohol concentrations after consuming it.\nConclusions/Significance: The bats we studied display a tolerance for ethanol that could have ramifications for the adaptive radiation of frugivorous and nectarivorous bats by allowing them to use ephemeral food resources over a wide span of time. By sampling across phyllostomid genera, we show that patterns of apparent ethanol tolerance in New World bats are broad, and thus may have been an important early step in the evolution of frugivory and nectarivory in these animals.",

We analyzed tissues from wing membrane of 67 individuals collected from two populations of Central Brazil (Brasília and Alto Paraíso). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 20, and the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.015 to 0.666 and from 0.016 to 0.915, respectively. The high combined probability of genetic identity (4.369 x 10-8) and probability of paternity exclusion (0.996) showed that these microsatellite loci would be useful for population genetic structure and parentage studies in natural populations of G. soricina.",

            "abstractNote": "The effects of urbanization on bats are poorly understood, but published data suggests it might be detrimental to them. Even though urban parks provide refuge to native biota, the nature of the urban landscape exacerbates the insularization process. In order to evaluate if wooded streets in an urban landscape provide connectivity for bats, we compared bat community structure in three different types of habitats: urban parks, wooded streets and non-wooded streets. Sampling occurred monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 in the city of Vito´ria, southeastern Brazil. Richness, relative abundance and diversity were higher in urban parks and lower in non-wooded streets. Jaccard’s similarity index showed that the wooded streets are more similar to non-wooded streets than to urban parks. Urbanization may beneﬁt generalist species by providing new resources, but for specialist species critical resources may be lost and persistence endangered. There is evidence that wooded streets may provide some degree of connectivity for birds in urban landscapes, but our results suggest that this is not the case, with wooded streets being used by few individuals of a few species. Vegetation cover is important to maintain bat diversity in urban centers. Activities like landscape planning and gardening should include biodiversity data in their outputs in order to better design a landscape that improves the likelihood of persistence of bats.",

The main objectives of the present study are to describe the bat community in a restinga in Paulo Cesar Vinha State Park, Guarapari municipality, state of Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil. Fieldwork was conducted twice a month from August 2004 to September 2005. A total sampling effort of 40,300 m2/h, represents the largest sampling effort for sampling bats in restingas to date. Bats were sampled in five different vegetational types in the area. Captured bats were processed recording information on species, sex, age, forearm length and weight. Shannon Diversity and Jaccard indexes were used to analyse diversity and similarity among habitats in the Park. A total of 554 captures belonging to 14 species and two families were obtained. Noctilio leporinus was recorded through direct observation and an ultra-sound detector also registered the presence of individuals from the family Molossidae, without being possible to distinguish it at specific level. Frugivores were the most representative guild. Richness was higher in Clusia shrubs (11 species) and Caraís lagoon (10 species). Shannon diversity index was estimated at H’ = 1.43 for the overall sample, with Caraís lagoon representing the most diverse habitat (H’ = 1.60). The greater similarity (J = 0.714) was observed for the two areas under high human influence.",

We captured 691 frugivorous bats from 15 species; Artibeus jamaicensis (A. jamaicensis) and Sturnira lilium (S. lilium) were the most abundant. There were no signiﬁcant differences in frugivorous bat richness and diversity in secondary forests, although species composition was notably different, S. lilium, A. jamaicensis, Glossophaga soricina, Artibeus lituratus and Carollia sowelli contributed the most to differences. Secondary forests are important for frugivorous bats conservation and in general for wildlife, since they are the last refuges in the Tabasco coastal plain, a region dominated by grasslands and urban areas.",

We compared mortality and morbidity in domestic animals using a mixed effects model controlling for village clustering, herd size, and proxy measures of household wealth. Thirty percent of household heads reported that their animals grazed on dropped fruit and 20% reported that they actively fed bitten fruit to their domestic herds. Household heads allowing their cattle to graze on dropped fruit were more likely to report an illness within their herd (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.02–1.31). Household heads directly feeding goats bitten fruit were more likely to report illness (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16–1.57) and deaths (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.13–2.4). Reporting of illnesses and deaths among goats rose as the frequency of feeding bitten fruit increased. One possible explanation for this ﬁnding is the transmission of bat pathogens to domestic animals via bitten fruit consumption.",

The phylogenetic relationship of core Insectivora or Eulipotyphla among major Eutherian orders was examined for these genes. A total evaluation of the maximum likelihood analyses of the four genes suggests that Chiroptera is the closest to Eulipotyphla among 4 eutherian groups (Primates, Eulipotyphla, Fereuungulata, Rodentia).",

Parkhomenko. — Generalized information on 9 bat species of the south of Sumy Oblast is presented based on own materials (29 specimens of 7 bat species from 3 localities) and on data from literature sources and catalogues of zoological collections (123 specimens of 9 species from 16 localities). The autumn mating of Vespertilio murinus was recorded in the region for the first time. Records of E. serotinus are clarified, which should be considered as records of E. lobatus. New findings of bats are reported from three localities. Most of the new records (51.1 %) are from the autumn, less from the summer (28.9 %) and the least from the spring (15.5 %). Most of the records are of P. auritus and M. daubentonii (34.9 %). New findings of bats in most cases were recorded during hunting (14 specimens), and, according to the literature, during daytime (43 specimens) and wintering (36 specimens). In total, 85.5 % of bats were recorded during the warm period of the year (April to November). More than the half of new records (17 specimens, 58.6 %) is related to anthropogenic habitats. Metric data (forearm length) are presented for 7 species and compared with data from other regions.",

            "abstractNote": "This paper pertains to the study on roosting habits and habitats of the Indian Flying Fox Pteropus medius Temminck, 1825 in 12 villages of four northern districts—Vellore, Krishnagiri, Tiruvannamalai, and Viluppuram—of Tamil Nadu. Studies targeted roosting tree species, population status, diurnal-roosting behaviour, interactions with other animals, and probable threats to the species. A total of 22,365 individuals of the species were observed in 72 roosting colonies in 72 trees belonging to nine families, 11 genera, and 13 species. The tree species that harbored the greatest population of P. medius (n= 12,465) were those of Tamarindus indica L. (Fabaceae) (n= 39), followed by Ficus religiosa L. (Moraceae) (n= 3,960), Madhuca latifolia J.F. Macbr. (Sapotaceae) (n= 2,760), and Ficus benghalensis L. (Moraceae) (n= 1,620). One-Way ANOVA revealed that a significant relationship exists between colony size and tree diameter at breast height (dbh), and their canopy size (p <0.05). However, no significant difference occurred between the colony size and tree height. The time taken for emergence of individuals of the colony from the canopy for foraging varied between 20 and 40 min after 1750 h in the evening. The species mostly roosted on trees proximal to human settlements, electrical power lines, and water bodies. Individuals of P. medius used various tree species in different areas in different geographical regions and did not maintain any consistency in roosting tree species selection. A majority of individuals (88.7 %; n= 887) were found roosting using both legs and a minority of P. medius (11.3 %; n= 113) were clinging to tree branches using one. Individuals of P. medius flew to nearby water bodies to quench thirst and cool their bodies. Mating was observed during day roost in 146 pairs including male-female fellatio in seven pairs. Smoke from shrines in sacred groves, pruning of branches for various cultural reasons, populations of House Crow Corvus splendens (Vieillot, 1817) (Corvidae), Black-winged Kite Elanus caeruleus (Desfontaines, 1789) and Black Kite Milvus migrans (Boddaert, 1783) (both Accipitridae) were key disturbances to roosting populations of P. medius.",

            "abstractNote": "The scientific merit of two opposing themes toward the conservation of Australian forest dwelling microchiroptera over the past four decades is reviewed. The initial theme throughout the 1960’s and 1970’s was of a vulnerable and threatened bat fauna – a contemporary view for which there is strong evidence. An opposing view, here termed the Adaptable Bat syndrome, emerged in the 1980’s. Rather than being of conservation concern, bats were portrayed as resilient, adaptable ecological generalists that could not “reasonably” be considered at risk from human impacts. The Adaptable Bat is an unsophisticated perspective that has been utilised as an ideological counter-attack against societal concern with escalating environmental destruction. This perspective was adopted by some management agencies and many bat workers. It is a modified off-shoot of a more general assertion of the infinite resilience of nature and represents a societal mind set that can be described as the utilitarian ideology, i.e. the dominance of resource utilisation above all other considerations. The chances of the long-term survival of bat fauna in forests used by the logging industry appear to be bleak because the ideology of the Adaptable Bat has dominated the agenda of biological assessments of the management, threat status and general biology of Australian bats for nearly 20 years. Perhaps the most significant lesson from the Adaptable Bat syndrome is that, like many issues in environmental management, the conservation of Australia’s forest bats has everything to do with cultural, political and corporate influences, and very little to do with biological “facts”.",

Our record of this species from the southwestern portion of the region known as Mixteca Baja Poblana is the first for Puebla and the most eastern record for the species in Central Mexico. It is a relevant datum since the species is endemic to the Tropical Dry Forests (TDF) of the Pacific coast and the Balsas River Basin in México, considered scarce and endangered by the Mexican government, and previously captured only in 6 states in the country. Our record extends its range ca. 74 km SE of the closest reported locality where it was previously registered, in Palpan, Morelos, México. We provide external measurements of one individual, information about the habitat where it was captured and about other bat species recorded in the same locality. The presence of this species at the capture site gives strength to the ongoing actions of our research group from Centro de Investigación en Biodiversidad y Conservación-Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos (CIByC-UAEM), to promote the creation of a new natural protected area for the conservation of TDF at this region.",

            "abstractNote": "In 2 different sites of the Lacandon Forest, Chiapas, Mexico, structural characteristics of tree roosts, such as height, cover, and diameter were described and evaluated. Microenvironmental traits (temperature and moisture) were also assessed in each roost where 3 species of phyllostomid bats Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata and Sturnira lilium were present. Eleven day-roosts were located and described after a systematic search of trees in both sites. Telemetry was also used as complementary method. Bat species preferred large roost-trees and with more than one cavity. All the roosts were located in areas of mature tropical forest or in advanced sucesional stages. The species preferred roosts in trees with lower values of moisture than those in the exterior (means with standard deviation) (81.04 ± 6.88%, on the inside against 93.56 ± 4.50% on the outside). Temperature was not an important trait for roost selection on trees for any of the bats studied.",

            "abstractNote": "The distribution of natural wintering roosts of bats in Poland is not homogenous, they are found almost exclusively in the south of Poland. Manmade underground shelters, on the other hand, are found across the country, including areas outside the range of natural caves. Based on literature data and my own observations, the size and species composition of winter bat aggregations occupying natural and artificial roosts were compared. The data analysed include records that were both published and collected between 1992 and 2019. The starting date of the range has been assumed due to the well-established formula of nationwide bat monitoring, which started in 1988, while the end date was based on the availability of publications. I arbitrarily adopted 50 individuals as the minimum number of bats in a certain wintering site, found on a minimum of one occasion during the study period. In total, I collected data on 128 wintering sites: 42 natural and 86 manmade. The overall size of the analysed aggregations is a minimum of 88 800 individuals, with manmade roosting sites accounting for a minimum of 77 600 individuals, and natural sites almost 12 200 individuals. The most abundant bat aggregations were recorded in manmade underground sites (up to 38 594 individuals), while in natural sites there were only up to 2900 individuals. However, the average aggregation size did not differ greatly between the two types of shelters (169 vs. 156, F = 3.368, df = 1.128; p = 0.069). In contrast, the number of species wintering in natural shelters is higher than in manmade ones (8 vs. 6 species, F = 9.785, df = 1.128, p = 0.002179). P. pipistrellus was found only in anthropogenic shelters. In addition, this type of shelter is characterised by a higher proportion of M. daubentonii (16.4% vs. 3.7%), M. myotis (42.0% vs. 29.1%), M. nattereri (26.4% vs. 16.5%), and B. barbastellus (11.3% vs. 7%), as well as species recorded incidentally: P. austriacus (0.09% vs. 0.04%) and E. serotinus (0.17% vs. 0.07%). In contrast, R. hipposideros (16.7%) and M. emarginatus (5.7%) were recorded almost exclusively in caves, and M. brandtii/mystacinus (15.6% vs. 0.3%) and P. auritus (4.2% vs. 1.9%) were clearly predominant in these shelters. Some of these differences could be explained by the effect of geographical location: some species are found only in the south of the country (R. hipposideros, M. emarginatus). On the other hand, artificial shelters are usually characterised by a more dynamic microclimate, which is preferred by species rarely found in natural shelters.",

            "abstractNote": "For four decades, there have been changes in the ranges of many bat species in Europe, particularly shifts in their northern limits. This phenomenon is more spectacular for migratory species than sedentary ones, especially for representatives of the genera Pipistrellus and Hypsugo. Kuhl’s pipistrelle Pipistrellus kuhlii (Kuhl, 1817) is the one of western Palaearctic bat species with conspicuous range expansion—in the last three decades, the species has rapidly expanded and colonised new territories both northwards and westwards. In Central Europe, two genetic lineages occur that are also quite different morphologically: P. kuhlii kuhlii (hereafter P. kuhlii) and P. kuhlii lepidus (hereafter P. lepidus). The contact zone between these two lineages passes through Hungary and Slovakia, although the real range of distinct lineages and/or morphotypes are still unclear. The first records of P. kuhlii from Poland (probably belonging to P. lepidus) come from Warszawa, central Poland (2004) and Zawiercie, southern Poland (2005): both specimens were males, found in December in buildings. Since then, there have been further reports of the presence of this species in Poland—occurring mostly in large cities along the valleys of large rivers such as the Wisła and Bug, from both periods of activity and hibernation. In subsequent years in Poland the occurrence of only P. lepidus has been confirmed, while P. kuhlii has been recorded from southern locations in the Carpathian Mountains in Slovakia. This paper describes the first record of this species from Poland, further indicating the existence of a maternity colony. In midJuly of 2020, a non-volant juvenile male was found in Kraków, Krowodrza district (50°04'11.7\" N, 19°54'55.9\" E). Initially poorly visible diagnostic features have become unambiguous with development and similar to those in P. kuhlii: narrow pale wing margin and orange penis colouration. After about two months in captivity, a mature individual capable of flying was released at the site where it was found. The presence of a maternity colony indicates that this species (i) has been part of the Polish fauna for several years, and (ii) its range in Poland possibly expands much further north.",

In this paper we quantify the consumption of fruits of both cacti by birds and bats. For two weeks during the fructification periods of S. griseus and C. repandus ripe fruits were offered to birds during the day and to bats at night. Bats consumed larger amount of C. repandus pulp than birds, while the consumption of S. griseus was the same for both groups. Birds consumed more S. griseus than C. repandus fruits, whereas bats consumed the fruits of both cacti species in equal amounts. We believe that the different results are due to the morphological characteristics of these fruits; C. repandus has fruits with cryptic coloring that makes their detection difficult for flying frugivores with color vision, while S. griseus has red fruits, which makes them conspicuous to avian frugivores. An ancillary preference study supports this notion, as birds were more likely to consume red-colored morphs of S. griseus compared to white-colored morphs. On the other hand, bats do not distinguish colors and consume both cacti species in equal amounts. This suggests that S. griseus, at least, presents an intermediate bird-bat dispersion syndrome, which, in principle, would guarantee greater fitness in comparison to C. repandus.",

A 1-year study of two populations of the bat Anoura geoffroyi Gray, 1838 in caves in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, found them to be parasitized by four species of streblids, three of which were parasitized by M. streblida. Three hundred and thirty-two individuals of M. streblida were collected in association with 135 individuals of Anastrebla modestini Wenzel, 1966, two individuals of A. caudiferae Wenzel, 1976, and two individuals of Trichobius sp. (dugesii complex). The predominant association of M. streblida with A. modestini suggests a preference for this host for the larvae of this mite. Fluctuations in the abundance of mites were found to accompany seasonal cycles and fluctuations in the abundance of their main host, with the mites being more abundant in months with higher temperatures and greater rainfall. The present work represents the first formal record of the occurrence of M. streblida in South America, increasing its range of occurrence southward by more than 5000 km.",

They contribute to transmission and spreading of microorganisms such as helminths, fungi, protozoa, bacteria and virus. The aim of the present study was to investigate natural filariid infection among bats in the Legal Amazon region, Brazil, by means of parasitological and molecular analyses. Blood samples were collected from 82 bats for blood smears and for DNA extraction via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Microfilariae were observed in blood smears from Carollia perspicillata (2), Artibeus lituratus (1), Artibeus fimbriatus (2), Dermanura gnoma (2) and Glossophaga soricina (1). Five positive samples were detected through the PCR assay and four of these were also positive in blood smears. From genome sequencing and comparative analysis with sequences deposited in GenBank, one sample showed 99.31% similarity to the species Litomosoides brasiliensis. The present study expands the geographical distribution of L. brasiliensis, to include the state of Maranhão as an area of occurrence of this species and includes D. gnoma and A. fimbriatus as hosts in Brazil.",

Although known as good seed dispersers, there is no broader assessment of the diversity of the diet of the genera (44 to 46 recognized genera) across different localities. We analyzed the frugivorous diet of the family Pteropodidae through an extensive bibliographical review, using consumption records to document bat-fruit relations across the Old World and variation among the biogeographic realms proposed by Holt et al. (2013). Our review resulted in 239 studies and 2.597 records of 33 bat genera consuming 642 species of 320 genera from 104 angiosperms families. The most consumed fruit genus was Ficus, in almost all zoogeographic realms. However, bat-fruit relationships vary among realms with numerous links to regionally endemic plant species, suggesting a relation between the bats’ distribution and diversification of the associated flora. The genus Pteropus in particular, shows a strong geographic pattern in diet composition. Data of this nature help to visualize patterns in resource use among different regions of the globe and across diverse bat species assemblages and can direct further research on the evolution of pteropodid bats, their critical food resources, and their role in seed dispersal and ecosystem processes.",

Alcance: Por el uso de las colecciones en los procesos de investigación y docencia, éstas requieren de un monitoreo periódico para evitar su deterioro y garantizar su permanencia. Metodología: Se realizó la sistematización (actualización de la base de datos al 2017-2018), e identificación de los especímenes que lo requerían y se estimó el índice de salud (ISC) con el propósito de comparar el estado actual con respecto a las condiciones ideales propuestas para todas las colecciones biológicas del país. Principales resultados: La colección de mamíferos cuenta con más de 1500 ejemplares catalogados pertenecientes a 12 órdenes, 37 familias y 179 especies. El 85,5% de los ejemplares están identificados hasta especie. Los órdenes más representativos dentro de la colección son Chiroptera con 1019 especímenes de 96 especies, con el 89,5% de los individuos identificados hasta especie. Rodentia es el segundo orden en representación con 243 especímenes y 33 especies, y con el 83,4% de los individuos identificados hasta especie. El ISC para el 2018 fue de 74%, lo que indica que la colección presenta condiciones ideales de almacenamiento e identificación de los especímenes ingresados. Conclusiones: Se requiere monitoreo constante del estado de la colección debido a su dinámica y crecimiento.",
