The wingspan, wing loading and aspect ratio of the two species were relatively low, and those of T. pachypus were lower compared with T. robustula. The echolocation calls of T. pachypus and T. robustula consist of a broadband frequency modulated (FM) sweep followed by a short narrowband FM sweep. The dominant frequency of calls of T. pachypus was 65.1 kHz, whereas that of T. robustula was 57.7 kHz. The call frequencies (including highest frequency of the call, lowest frequency of the call and frequency of the call that contained most energy) of T. pachypus were higher than those of T. robustula, and the pulse duration of the former was longer than that of the latter. The inter-pulse interval and bandwidth of the calls were not signiﬁcantly different between the two species. Tylonycteris pachypus foraged in more complex environments than T. robustula, although the two species were both netted in edge habitats (around trees or houses), along pathways and in the tops of trees. Tylonycteris pachypus ﬂew slower (straight level ﬂight speed, 4.3 m sÀ1) than T. robustula (straight level ﬂight speed, 4.8 m sÀ1). We discuss the relationship between wing morphology, echolocation calls, foraging behaviour and ﬂight speed, and demonstrate resource partitioning between these two species in terms of morphological and behavioural factors.",

            "abstractNote": "Rhinolophids (horseshoe bats) are a widespread and diverse family. Their high level of morphological convergence has made taxonomic identification and estimation of species diversity problematic. The Rhinolophus philippinensis group, which is characterized with huge ears and low echolocation frequency relative to body size, is a specific group among all the rhinolophid groups, but the phylogeny of this group is poorly understood. In this study, we performed integrated analyses of the morphology, acoustic and genetic data and constructed the first multilocus phylogeny for the philippinensis group using four mitochondrial genes, four autosomal introns and one Y‐linked intron in 95 specimens representing nine taxa. Phylogenies were constructed based on concatenated phylogenetic methods and a multilocus coalescence approach. The estimated phylogenies revealed the polyphyly of the philippinensis group. Except for R. philippinensis, all the other species in this group formed a monophyletic cluster, named herewith as “R. macrotis” species group. Phylogenies, genetic and phenotypic divergence, and species delimitation analyses supported the revised status of R. paradoxolophus as a subspecies of R. rex, R. cf. macrotis as a subspecies of R. macrotis, and R. huananus and R. cf. siamensis as junior synonyms of R. siamensis. Significant discordances were found between the mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting or ancient introgression events within the philippinensis group. The macrotis group appeared to have undergone a rapid radiation approximately 2.57 million years ago during the early Pleistocene period due to palaeoclimatic oscillations. Reconstruction of the ancestral ranges suggested a wide distribution of the common ancestor for the philippinensis and macrotis groups.",

The morphology, echolocation call structure, diet, and foraging areas of S. kuhlii were studied on Hainan Island, south China from March to November 2006. Data from 85 individuals indicate that S. kuhlii is a medium-sized bat with 50.41 ± 1.36 (0 ± SE) mm forearm length and 19.81 ± 3.47 g body mass. The wing morphology with high wing-loading (11.38 ± 1.95 N/m2) and moderate aspect ratio (6.96 ± 0.75) indicates that S. kuhlii flies fast and forages in open habitat and at the edges of cluttered environments. Echolocation calls of S. kuhlii consist of a fundamental and up to four harmonics, with a dominant frequency of 45.72 ± 2.09 kHz, and call shape suggests that this species is adapted to forage in open environments. Data from mist-netting and acoustic detection indicated that S. kuhlii foraged mainly around the crown of trees and street lights. Nine insect orders were recorded in its diet, with Lepidoptera (97.46%, by frequency) and Coleoptera (64.72 ± 2.37%, by volume) constituting the main prey, together with Hemiptera (19.99 ± 1.25%) and Hymenoptera (9.43 ± 1.14%). There was significant seasonal variation in the diet of S. kuhlii: Coleoptera increased from March to May, and then decreased to August, while Hemiptera and Hymenoptera showed the inverse trend.",

To investigate the DNA faecal prevalence of the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum, we sampled 23 lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) maternity colonies located in buildings (churches, barns) in rural villages of eastern France. A total of 552 faecal samples were collected from 278 individuals. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was detected in the faeces of 63 individuals (22.7%). Such high prevalence might suggest persistent infection in bats and/or a frequent consumption of insect preys carrying bacteria. Faecal DNA prevalence varied highly among colonies but was not related to the colony size. Faecal DNA prevalence was the highest in the Jura Department, where the density of ticks is known to be the highest across the study area. Because the sampled bats live in close proximity to humans, we discuss how concerning the presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in bat guano is for humans frequenting places of worship that shelter bats. We also advocate future research to understand what a high faecal DNA prevalence in bat guano really implicates in terms of bacteria transmission.",

Animals studied A total of 36 bats belonging to three different species (Desmodus rotundus, Diameus youngi, and Artibeus lituratus) were used to perform this investigation. Thirteen Diameus youngi and six Desmodus rotundus were trapped in a cave, and 17 captive Artibeus lituratus were obtained from an experimental colony. Both free-ranging and captive bats were free of apparent ocular or systemic disease. Procedures Corneal and conjunctival swabs were collected from both eyes to identify the resident bacterial microbiota.\nResults Seventeen bats had positive bacterial cultures in one or both eyes. Considering all isolates, Gram-positive bacteria (82.6%) predominated over those that were Gramnegative bacteria (17.4%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (30.4%) were the most isolated genus, followed by Bacillus spp. (26%) and Corynebacterium spp. (21%). Only four Gram-negative species were isolated: Shigella spp., Hafnia alvei, Morganella morganii, and Flavobacterium odoratum.\nConclusions In this study, bacterial microbiota of the ocular surface of bats was described, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated type of microorganism from healthy bat eyes.",

Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underpinning hibernation remain largely unclear. This study used RNA‐seq and Iso‐seq techniques to investigate the changes in liver transcriptome expression of\n              Rhinolophus pusillus\n              during hibernation and active periods, as well as under different microhabitat temperatures. We identified 11 457 differentially expressed genes during hibernation and active periods, of which 395 showed significant differential expression. Genes associated with fatty acid catabolism were significantly upregulated during hibernation, whereas genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and glycogen synthesis were downregulated. Conversely, immune‐related genes displayed differential expression patterns: genes tied to innate immunity were significantly upregulated, while those linked to adaptive immunity and inflammatory response were downregulated. The analysis of transcriptomic data obtained from different microhabitat temperatures revealed that\n              R. pusillus\n              exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism in lower microhabitat temperature. This upregulation facilitated an enhanced utilization rate of triglyceride, ultimately resulting in increased energy provision for the organism. Additionally,\n              R. pusillus\n              upregulated gluconeogenesis‐related genes regardless of the microhabitat temperature, demonstrating the importance of maintaining blood glucose levels during hibernation. Our transcriptomic data reveal that these changes in liver gene expression optimize energy allocation during hibernation, suggesting that liver tissue adaptively responds to the inherent stress of its function during hibernation. This study sheds light on the role of differential gene expression in promoting more efficient energy allocation during hibernation. It contributes to our understanding of how liver tissue adapts to the stressors associated with this state.",

Observations during 3 years showed that their wintering was successful. The temperature of the body surface of hibernating animals was –1.8°C in January. The surface temperature of the walls of the tunnel close to the animals was ‒1.9°C, although the air temperature outside the wintering spot was extremely low, –45…–50°C. Winter hibernation consisted of long stupors and short periodic awakenings. During spontaneous awakenings, the bats moved in the tunnel, flied and emitted sounds.",

Artiﬁcial selection for increased resistance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium was performed, and after eight generations, the average median effective concentration increased from 61 to 180 ␮g/L. No differences in life span, offspring production, time to ﬁrst brood, number of offspring in the ﬁrst brood, or intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were observed between the cadmiumadapted population and the controls under ideal conditions or under conditions of temperature or feeding ration stress, but cadmiumadapted daphnids were smaller. Control and cadmium-adapted populations were equally sensitive to copper and malathion, but the cadmium-adapted population was less sensitive to lead and more sensitive to phenol. Analysis of ampliﬁed fragment-length polymorphisms indicated a signiﬁcant decrease in genetic diversity in the cadmium-adapted population. Although the evolved cadmium resistance would allow adapted populations to exist in areas where cadmium concentrations would be toxic to unadapted populations, the decreased genetic diversity, smaller size, and increased sensitivity to at least one other toxicant could reduce the probability of long-term survival even in the absence of future cadmium exposure.",

While searching and hunting for prey, bats experience sonar interference, not only from densely cluttered environments, but also from calls of conspecifics foraging in close proximity. Previous work has shown that when two bats compete for a single prey item in a relatively open environment, one of the bats may go silent for extended periods of time, which can serve to minimize sonar interference between conspecifics. Additionally, pairs of big brown bats have been shown to adjust frequency characteristics of their vocalizations to avoid acoustic interference in echo processing. In this study, we extended previous work by examining how the presence of conspecifics <i>and</i> environmental clutter influence the bat's echolocation behavior. By recording multichannel audio and video data of bats engaged in insect capture in open and cluttered spaces, we quantified the bats' vocal and flight behaviors. Big brown bats flew individually and in pairs in an open and cluttered room, and the results of this study shed light on the different strategies that this species employs to negotiate a complex and dynamic environment.",

This issue can be circumvented for multisite data using design‐based inference.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    These points are illustrated by example – our plant abundances were found to violate the implicit\n                    P\n                    oisson assumption of\n                    CATS\n                    , but a negative binomial regression had much improved fit, and our model was extended to multisite data in order to directly model the environment–trait interaction. Violations of the\n                    P\n                    oisson assumption were strong and accounting for them qualitatively changed results, presumably because larger counts had undue influence when overdispersion had not been accounted for. We advise that future\n                    CATS\n                    analysts routinely check for overdispersion and account for it if present.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are particularly susceptible to environmental changes because of their low reproductive rate, longevity, and high metabolic rates, which lead to relatively high food requirements. Thus, bat populations take a relatively long time to recover from increased mortality rates, and monitoring schemes should cover long time periods. In this work, we analyzed the population trajectories of two bat species, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis myotis, the most numerous in five caves in southern Poland, which are known as important bat hibernacula on a continental scale. Data were collected by regular counts in 1985–2020, depending on the particular cave; in addition, previous data on the number of hibernating bats in these caves, available since 1951, were taken from existing publications. We analyzed time-series data using average locality indices and TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data) methods, and both produced similar results. Generally, the populations of the two studied bat species showed recent increasing trends, especially visible as an effect of recovery after years of decline. The situation recorded in southern Poland is very similar to that described in other places in Europe, where recoveries of bat populations have also been observed in the last decades. Although it is difficult to present results from formal analyses, because of the lack of good data, at least some factors—less exposure to contaminants (pesticides, heavy metals), improving food availability due to climate change, and a lower predation rate (including human pressure), both in the breeding season and during wintering—positively affected both species.",

With an expected higher copulation rate, harem males may deplete seminal fluids or increase epididymal sperm maturation, generating poor sperm quality. In a first study, we reported a higher sperm quality in sneaker males of Carollia perspicillata. To test whether the lower sperm quality observed in harem males was generated by an elevated copulation rate, we temporarily removed males of both social statuses from the colony. We thus assessed status-related changes of sperm quality resulting from sexual abstinence. Moreover, released from territory and female guarding, harem males were expected to show a reduction in somatic costs. On the basis of sperm competition models, we predicted a higher resource investment in the ejaculate with the reduction of pre-copulatory efforts. In line with our predictions, sperm quality of harem males improved significantly in contrast to sneaker males, whose sperm quality did not change. Without an increase in ejaculate lipid peroxidation, our results also provide evidence that the duration of sexual abstinence was not sufficient to generate sperm oxidative damage through senescence. Harem males did not show a reduction in blood lipid peroxidation or in the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione. In line with the maintenance of these somatic costs, harem males did not invest more superoxide dismutase to the ejaculate to maintain sperm quality. Our results suggest that a difference in copulation rate rather than an adaptation to sperm competition provides sneaker males with higher sperm quality in C. perspicillata.",

We examined the distributions of Myotis lucifugus (little brown myotis), Myotis septentrionalis (northern long-eared myotis), and Perimyotis subflavus (tri-colored bat) in eastern Nebraska by setting acoustic detectors for a single night at 105 sites in wooded habitats during summers of 2012 and 2014. We compared 2 methods of determining presence at each site. Results of our analyses are fine-scale distributional maps for these bats and some range extensions from published records. Results for M. septentrionalis and P. subflavus are largely consistent with previous reports. Results for M. lucifugus vary depending on the method of determining presence; however, our preferred method creates a pattern consistent with the known vouchered distribution of this species. The differences between published distributions of these species and distributions based on acoustic detection from our study might result from a lack of extensive netting in many areas of eastern Nebraska, underrepresentation of P. subflavus from mist net surveys in Nebraska, and a recent westward range expansion of P. subflavus and M. septentrionalis in southern Nebraska.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) has claimed the lives of millions of hibernating insectivorous bats in North America. Its etiologic agent, the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans, causes skin lesions that are the hallmark of the disease. The fungal infection is characterized by a white powdery growth on muzzle, ears and wing membranes. While WNS may threaten some species of North American bats with regional extinction, infection in hibernating bats in Europe seems not to be associated with significant mortality. We performed histopathological investigations on biopsy samples of 11 hibernating European bats, originating from 4 different countries, colonized by G. destructans. One additional bat was euthanized to allow thorough examination of multiple strips of its wing membranes. Molecular analyses of touch imprints, swabs and skin samples confirmed that fungal structures were G. destructans. Additionally, archived field notes on hibernacula monitoring data in the Harz Mountains, Germany, over an 11-year period (2000-2011) revealed multiple capture-recapture events of 8 banded bats repeatedly displaying characteristic fungal colonization. Skin lesions of G. destructans-affected hibernating European bats are intriguingly similar to the epidermal lesions described in North American bats. Nevertheless, deep invasion of fungal hyphae into the dermal connective tissue with resulting ulceration like in North American bats was not observed in the biopsy samples of European bats; all lesions found were restricted to the layers of the epidermis and its adnexae. Two bats had mild epidermal cupping erosions as described for North American bats. The possible mechanisms for any difference in outcomes of G. destructans infection in European and North American bats still need to be elucidated.",

Our investigation into intersexual feeding habits of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) revealed different feeding strategies between males and females. Contrary to our predictions, there was no significant difference in time of emergence between males and females, and males and females foraged for equal lengths of time. Temperature influenced length of foraging bouts of both sexes. Female bats exhibited site fidelity within the river valley close to the colonies. Males foraged over larger areas than did females, and spent significantly more time away from the main feeding area than did females. We conclude that the areas in which males foraged were of lower quality or required longer commuting distances, thus requiring males to forage for as long as females.",

Using radio telemetry, we obtained empirical evidence of roosting activity for Little Brown Myotis on the north coast of British Columbia. One non-reproductive adult female and 2 adult male Little Brown Myotis were found to use 4 unique roosting locations in the Prince Rupert area. Three of 4 confirmed roost sites were located in anthropogenic structures, including an industrial warehouse and two 2-story houses. The 4th roost was located in a cedar hedge on a residential property. Roosts were located within 890 to 1140 m of capture sites, which were sited in suitable bat foraging habitat. One male bat re-used the same daytime roost for the duration of the study period, whereas a 2nd male selected 2 different roost locations during the study. Despite the potential limitation of the small sample size of this telemetry study, our findings contribute to the understanding of roosts used by Little Brown Myotis on the north coast of British Columbia, and provide a basis for future directed studies and conservation efforts.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary Glossophagine nectar-feeding bats exploit ﬂowers while hovering in front of them. Aerodynamic theory predicts that power output for hovering ﬂight in Glossophaga soricina is 2.6 times higher than during horizontal ﬂight. We tested this prediction by measuring rates of gas exchange during hoverfeeding. Five individuals of Glossophaga soricina (mean mass 11.7 g) were trained to feed from a nectar dispenser designed as a ﬂow-through respirometry mask. Single hover-feeding events lasted for up to 4.5 s. Measured rates of .gas excha.nge varied as a function of hovering duration. VO2 and VCO2 during short hovering events (up to 1 s) were 20.5±6.7 ml g−1 h−1 (N=55) and 21.6±5.6 ml g−1 h−1 (N=39) (means ± S.D.), respectively. These values are in the range of a previous estimate of the metabolic power input for level forward ﬂight (23.8 ml O2 g−1 h−1). However, during hovering events lasting longer than 3 s, oxygen uptake was only 16.7±3.5 ml g−1 h−1 (N=73), which is only 70 % of the value expected for forward ﬂight. Thus, bats reduced their rate of oxygen uptake during longer periods of hovering compared with level forward ﬂight. This result is in contrast to the predicted hovering cost derived from aerodynamic theory. The exact metabolic power input during hovering remains uncertain. During longer hovering events, bats were probably not in respiratory steady state, as indicated by the deviation of the respiratory exchange ratio from the expected value of 1 (oxidization of nectar sugar) to the measured value of 0.8.",

Since the first cases were recorded, WNS has spread rapidly across North America and is now confirmed or suspected in 40 US states and seven Canadian provinces. Often, the presence of P. destructans is detected in a cave or hibernaculum before signs of WNS manifest in the resident bat population, making presence of the fungus a more reliable assessment of potential epidemic spread than expansion of manifested WNS. An analysis of 43 cave internal climates across the state of Texas revealed a pattern of thermal suitability for P. destructans that correlated significantly with landscape (elevation, lithology) and external climate (mean surface temperature and precipitation). We generated a predictive model to assess the potential spread of P. destructans through Texas karst systems based on external features that correlate with suitable internal climates for fungal growth. Applications of this model to external climatic variables from 2019 showed seasonally varying patterns of suitability for fungal growth in select regions of Texas karst systems. Results from these surveys and models showed that internal climates of Texas caves are likely able to sustain the growth of P. destructans and could cause disease and resulting declines in Texas bats, and act as stepping-stones for the fungus, allowing it to travel southward into Mexican and Central American cave systems. The resulting work will inform researchers and natural resource managers of areas of significant concern to monitor for the spread of WNS.",

Microsatellite loci were developed for the taxonomic and population genetic assessment of the Australian complex of this species. Of the 33 primer sets designed for this research, seven (21%) were deemed suitably polymorphic for population-level analyses of the Australian taxa, with ﬁve (71%) of these loci revealing moderate to high levels of polymorphism (PIC = 0.56 to 0.91). The cross-taxa utility of the M. schreibersii microsatellite markers was assessed in the microbat (Chiroptera) family Miniopteridae. Sub-species and species covering the Miniopteridae’s global distribution (with the exception of the Middle East) were selected, numbering 25 taxa in total. Ampliﬁcation was successful for 26 loci, of which 20 (77%) were polymorphic. High cross-taxa utility of markers was observed with ampliﬁcation achieved for all taxa for between four (20%) and 20 (100%) loci, and polymorphism was considered moderate to high (PIC = 0.47–0.91) for 12 (60%) of these loci. The high cross-taxa utility of the microsatellites reported herein reveal versatile and cost-effective molecular markers, contributing an important genetic resource for the research and conservation of Miniopteridae species worldwide.",

A total of 14 370 prey items were brought home by 986 cats living in 618 households. Mammals made up 69% of the items, birds 24%, amphibians 4%, reptiles 1%, ﬁsh <1%, invertebrates 1% and unidentiﬁed items 1%. A minimum of 44 species of wild bird, 20 species of wild mammal, four species of reptile and three species of amphibian were recorded. 2. Of a sample of 696 individual cats, 634 (91%) brought home at least one item and the back-transformed mean number of items brought home was 11.3 (95% CI 10.4–12.2). The back-transformed means and number of cats retrieving at least one item from each prey group were: 8.1 (7.4–8.9) mammals for 547 (79%) cats, 4.1 (3.8–4.5) birds for 506 (73%) cats, 2.6 (2.2–3.0) herpetofauna for 145 (21%) cats and 2.2 (1.8–2.7) other items for 98 (14%) cats. 3. The number of birds and herpetofauna brought home per cat was signiﬁcantly lower in households that provided food for birds. The number of bird species brought home was greater in households providing bird food. The number of birds and herpetofauna brought home per cat was negatively related to the age and condition of the cat. The number of mammals brought home per cat was signiﬁcantly lower when cats were equipped with bells and when they were kept indoors at night. The number of herpetofauna brought home was signiﬁcantly greater when cats were kept in at night. 4. Based on the proportion of cats bringing home at least one prey item and the backtransformed means, a British population of approximately 9 million cats was estimated to have brought home in the order of 92 (85–100) million prey items in the period of this survey, including 57 (52–63) million mammals, 27 (25–29) million birds and 5 (4–6) million reptiles and amphibians. 5. An experimental approach should be taken to investigate the factors found by this descriptive survey to inﬂuence the numbers of prey brought home by cats. In particular, investigation of potential management practices that could reduce the numbers of wild animals killed and brought home by cats will be useful for wildlife conservation, particularly in suburban areas.",

            "abstractNote": "Molecular approaches to calculate effective population size estimates (Ne) are increasingly used as an alternative to long-term demographic monitoring of wildlife populations. However, the complex ecology of most long-lived species and the consequent uncertainties in model assumptions means that effective population size estimates are often imprecise. Although methods exist to incorporate age structure into Ne estimations for long-lived species with overlapping generations, they are rarely used owing to the lack of relevant information for most wild populations. Here, we performed a case study on an elusive woodland bat, Myotis bechsteinii, to compare the use of the parentage assignment Ne estimator (EPA) with the more commonly used linkage disequilibrium (LD) Ne estimator in detecting long-term population trends, and assessed the impacts of deploying different overall sample sizes. We used genotypic data from a previously published study, and simulated 48 contrasting demographic scenarios over 150 years using the life history characteristics of this species The LD method strongly outperformed the EPA method. As expected, smaller sample sizes resulted in a reduced ability to detect population trends. Nevertheless, even the smallest sample size tested (n = 30) could detect important changes (60%–80% decline) with the LD method. These results demonstrate that genetic approaches can be an effective way to monitor long-lived species, such as bats, provided that they are undertaken over multiple decades.",

Libraries of echolocation calls provide huge potential resources for bat species identifications, ecological studies and conservation surveys. Here, the echolocation calls of two morphologically similar bat species (Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus fuliginosus) were recorded and described in order to characterize vocal signatures for field identification in China. Both M. magnater and M. fuliginosus emitted short frequency modulated echolocation calls with narrow bandwidths. Each call of the former species included two harmonics, with the first harmonic being the strongest, whereas calls of the latter species normally contained one harmonic. Although call durations were similar between the two species, there were significant differences in start, end and peak frequencies between M. magnater and M. fuliginous. The results showed that 92.3% of all calls recorded in China were attributed to the correct species based on spectral features of echolocation calls. We concluded that echolocation calls are valuable characters for the identification of morphologically similar bat species.",

The results indicated that R. pusillus (including calidus, parcus, and szechuanus) in the continental region and Hainan Island of China and “R. cornutus” in Japan are morphologically divergent species. Rhinolophus cornutus should be further split into R. cornutus (including orii, pumilus, and miyakonis) in the main islands of Japan, the Amami and Okinawa Group of the central Ryukyu Archipelago, and Miyako Group of the southern Ryukyus; and R. perditus and R. imaizumii from the Yaeyama Group in the southern Ryukyus. Rhinolophus monoceros from Taiwan is morphologically more similar to species in Japan than to R. pusillus. In addition to R. pusillus, another form that is morphologically similar to species in Japan was recognized from Langzhong in Sichuan Province; this may represent an undescribed species, and further examination is necessary to determine its taxonomic status. Specimens from Guang’an in Sichuan Province, China, are also different from the others, and are characterized by the smallest skull size. Although further studies are required, these specimens were tentatively identified as R. subbadius.",

Clarifying the relative roles of each process is a long-­standing research goal in evolutionary biology. Acoustic signals of bats are a phenotypic characteristic that plays an important role in social organization and species recognition. We extensively sampled the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) throughout China and Vietnam and reconstructed a species phylogeny to better understand the patterns and causes of the geographic variation of acoustic signals. Our results showed that the resting frequency (RF) of calls varied with latitude, sex, and distance among different colony locations. RF differences were not correlated with genetic distance (based on only one nuclear locus and the mitochondrial locus), climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitable water), or body size, although differences in calls increased with distance among various populations. This suggests that cultural drift may play more important roles than genetic drift and acoustic adaptation in shaping acoustic differences within regions in R. sinicus.",

The base compositions present clearly the A–T skew, which is most obviously in the control region and protein-coding genes.

            "abstractNote": "Background: Kaeng Khoi virus (KKV), which belongs to the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Perbunyaviridae, was originally isolated from the brain tissue of bats and may cause infection in humans. In this study, the KKV strain WDBC1403 was isolated from bat ﬂies (Eucampsipoda sundaica), ectoparasites of the bat Rousettus leschenaultia, collected from Yunnan Province of China at the Sino-Burmese border.\nMethods and Results: The bat ﬂy specimens were ground and inoculated in culture cells. The WDBC1403 strain was shown to induce cytopathic effects in Vero, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), and Tb1Lu cells, but not in C6/36 cells; however, viral gene ampliﬁcation was detected in the supernatants of C6/36 cells. Using electron microscopy, the virus was determined to be spherical, enveloped, and 80–90 nm in diameter; it was also shown to form plaques in BHK-21 cells and the titer reached 1 · 106.57 plaque-forming units/mL 24 h after infection. The phylogenetic analysis showed that WDBC1403 is a KKV strain, but is independent of the original KKV strain (PSC-19). Viral genome analysis revealed that the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the S, M, and L segments of WDBC1403 with PSC-19 were 88.2% and 96.1%, 76.7% and 85.0%, and 78.3% and 88.9%, respectively. Two amino acids were removed at the end of the open reading frame of the M segment, and 47 nucleotides were removed in the 3¢-untranslated region of the M segment of the WDBC1403 strain compared with the PSC-19 strain.\nConclusions: The WDBC1403 strain is a highly divergent KKV strain, suggesting that there are a variety of KKV strains that exhibit molecular differences. Moreover, because of the large variations in nucleotide and amino acid sequence in the M segment, which encodes an important membrane protein, further research on antigenicity and pathogenicity in humans and animals is needed.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: The gut microbiota is closely linked to host development, diet and health and is inﬂuenced by both the host and the environment. Although many studies have focused on the dynamics of the gut microbiota during development in captive animals, few studies have focused on the dynamics of the gut microbiota during development in wild animals, especially for the order Chiroptera.\nMethods: In this study, we characterized the gut microbiota of the wild Asian particolored bat (Vespertilio sinensis) from 1 day to 6 weeks after birth. We explored the changes in their gut microbial community compositions, examined possible inﬂuencing factors, and predicted the feeding transition period.\nResults: The gut microbiota changed during the development of V. sinensis. The alpha diversity of the bats’ gut microbiota gradually increased but did not change signiﬁcantly from the 1st day to the 4th week after birth; however, the alpha diversity decreased signiﬁcantly in week 5, then stabilized. The beta diversity differed slightly in weeks 4–6. In week 4, the fecal samples showed the highest diversity in bacterial community composition. Thus, we predicted that the potential feeding transition period for V. sinensis may occur during week 4. Redundancy analysis showed that age and body mass index signiﬁcantly affected the compositional changes of the gut microbiota in Asian particolored bats.\nConclusion: The gut microbiota changed during the development of V. sinensis. We suggest that changes in the alpha and beta diversity during week 4 after birth indicate a potential feeding transition, highlighting the importance of diet in the gut microbiota during the development of V. sinensis.",

All the protein-coding genes (total length of 11,404 bp) were encoded in H-strand except for ND6 in L-strand. Total length of 22 tRNA genes was 1508 bp varying from 62 bp (tRNASer(AGY)) to 74 bp (tRNALeu(UUR) and tRNAGln). The 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes were 972 and 1558 bp in length, respectively. The D-loop region was 1383 bp in length and included 54 copies of 6 bp tandem repeat (ACGCAT).",

Bats under stressful conditions, for example when confronted by a predator, will emit aggressive social calls. The presentation of aggressive social calls, including distress calls (DCs), is known to increase heart rate (fH), but how this change in fH is related to the bat’s sound perception and how this evokes behaviors such as the fear response is unknown. Herein, we show that the perception of a distress context induces freezing behavior as a fear response in bats. We found that bats responded by freezing and displayed increased fH when they were presented with a conspecific donor bat in a distress situation evoked by gentle poking with a cotton swab. In addition, when we presented two types of auditory oddball paradigms with different probabilities of DCs and echolocation calls (ECs), the bats’ fH increased when DCs were presented as deviant or control stimuli within standard ECs but did not increase when DCs were presented as standard stimuli. These results suggest that the situational context created by the frequency of sound presentation, rather than simply a single sound feature, induces fH increases and freezing as fear responses in bats.",

In the field, it is visited by two different kinds of pollinators with differential success: moths visit the flowers at night, and their movements result in broad pollen dispersal and large seed production, whereas bees, wasps, and flies visit the flowers in the mornings and have decreased pollination effectiveness. However, this differential success may be due to a decrease in stigmatic receptivity soon after the flowers open. We performed controlled pollinations to determine the effect of stigma age on pollen germination and seed set. We pollinated flowers at 12‐h intervals up to 120 h and divided these into two sets: from one set, we removed stigmas 24 h after pollination to examine percentage of pollen germination. The second set of flowers was allowed to produce fruits, and the seeds were counted and weighed. Pollen germination declined significantly with stigma age, but there was no significant effect of stigma age at pollination on the number or mass of resulting seeds. Thus, the decreased pollination success of bees is not due to a decrease in stigmatic receptivity but is most likely a result of pollinator inefficiency.",

After reviewing the conceptual and computational features of these methods, a new implementation of hurdle and zero-inﬂated regression models in the functions hurdle() and zeroinfl() from the package pscl is introduced. It re-uses design and functionality of the basic R functions just as the underlying conceptual tools extend the classical models. Both hurdle and zeroinﬂated model, are able to incorporate over-dispersion and excess zeros—two problems that typically occur in count data sets in economics and the social sciences—better than their classical counterparts. Using cross-section data on the demand for medical care, it is illustrated how the classical as well as the zero-augmented models can be ﬁtted, inspected and tested in practice.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat wing morphology is considered in relation to flight performance and flight behaviour to clarify the functional basis for eco-morphological correlations in flying animals. Bivariate correlations are presented between wing dimensions and body mass for a range of bat families and feeding classes, and principal-components analysis is used to measure overall size, wing size and wing shape. The principal components representing wing size and wing shape (as opposed to overall size) are interpreted as being equivalent to wing loading and to aspect ratio. Relative length and area of the hand-wing or wingtip are determined independently of wing size, and are used to derive a wingtip shape index, which measures the degree of roundedness or pointedness of the wingtip. The optimal wing form for bats adapted for different modes of flight is predicted by means of mechanical and aerodynamic models. We identify and model aspects of performance likely to influence flight adaptation significantly; these include selective pressures for economic forward flight (low energy per unit time or per unit distance (equal to cost of transport)), for flight at high or low speeds, for hovering, and for turning. \"Turning performance is measured by two quantities: manoeuvrability, referring to the minimum space required for a turn at a given speed; and agility, relating to the rate at which a turn can be initiated. High flight speed correlates with high wing loading, good manoeuvrability is favoured by low wing loading, and turning agility should be associated with fast flight and with high wing loading. Other factors influencing wing adaptations, such as migration, flying with a foetus or young or carrying loads in flight (all of which favour large wing area), flight in cluttered environments (short wings) and modes of landing, are identified. The mechanical predictions are cast into a size-independent principal-components form, and are related to the morphology and the observed flight behaviour of different species and families of bats. In this way we provide a broadly based functional interpretation of the selective forces that influence wing morphology in bats. Measured flight speeds in bats permit testing of these predictions. Comparison of open-field free-flight speeds with morphology confirms that speed correlates with mass, wing loading and wingtip proportions as expected; there is no direct relation between speed and aspect ratio. Some adaptive trends in bat wing morphology are clear from this analysis. Insectivores hunt in a range of different ways, which are reflected in their morphology. Bats hawking high-flying insects have small, pointed wings which give good agility, high flight speeds and low cost of transport. Bats hunting for insects among vegetation, and perhaps gleaning, have very short and rounded wingtips, and often relatively short, broad wings, giving good manoeuvrability at low flight speeds. Many insectivorous species forage by ‘ flycatching ’ (perching while seeking prey) and have somewhat similar morphology to gleaners. Insectivorous species foraging in more open habitats usually have slightly longer wings, and hence lower cost of transport. Piscivores forage over open stretches of water, and have very long wings giving low flight power and cost of transport, and unusually long, rounded tips for control and stability in flight. Carnivores must carry heavy loads, and thus have relatively large wing areas; their foraging strategies consist of perching, hunting and gleaning, and wing structure is similar to that of insectivorous species with similar behaviour. Perching and hovering nectarivores both have a relatively small wing area: this surprising result may result from environmental pressure for a short wingspan or from the advantage of high speed during commuting flights; the large wingtips of these bats are valuable for lift generation in slow flight. The relation between flight morphology (as an indicator of flight behaviour) and echolocation is considered. It is demonstrated that adaptive trends in wing adaptations are predictably and closely paralleled by echolocation call structure, owing to the joint constraints of flying and locating food in different ways. Pressures on flight morphology depend also on size, with most aspects of performance favouring smaller animals. Power rises rapidly as mass increases; in smaller bats the available energy margin is greater than in larger species, and they may have a more generalized repertoire of flight behaviour. Trophic pressures related to feeding strategy and behaviour are also important, and may restrict the size ranges of different feeding classes: insectivores and primary nectarivores must be relatively small, carnivores and frugivores somewhat larger. The relation of these results to bat community ecology is considered, as our predictions may be tested through comparisons between comparable, sympatric species. Our mechanical predictions apply to all bats and to all kinds of bat communities, but other factors (for example echolocation) may also contribute to specialization in feeding or behaviour, and species separation may not be determined solely by wing morphology or flight behaviour. None the less, we believe that our approach, of identifying functional correlates of bat flight behaviour and identifying these with morphological adaptations, clarifies the eco-morphological relationships of bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The bat fauna of arid regions is still poorly studied mostly due to a lack of interest in areas with low species richness and a low number of threatened species. In this study, we reviewed the status of bat diversity in the arid parts of southern Africa, with the aim of setting up a baseline for future work. In particular, we described species richness patterns across four arid zones within the region (Namib Desert, Kalahari, Nama Karoo and Succulent Karoo), exploring abiotic gradients and local landscape structure. Additionally, we examined bat functional groups in this region and compared them with those of three other arid regions of the world to identify potential similarities and diﬀerences. The southern African arid region hosted 17 bat species, representing eight families, of which three are endemic to the region (Rhinolophus denti, Laephotis namibensis and Cistugo seabrae) and one is vagrant (the fruit bat Eidolon helvum). Species richness varied spatially within this arid region, being highest in the drier but topographically heterogeneous Namib Desert, probably as a result of roost availability. With regards to functional groups, the southern African arid region had few bat species adapted to foraging in open spaces, particularly when compared with the neighbouring savannahs. Drawing from this study, we suggest that: a) despite species richness decreasing with increasing aridity at the sub-continental scale, at a more local scale landscape features (e.g. habitat structure) might be more relevant than aridity in determining bat species richness; and b) an unknown factor, possibly patterns of temperature limiting the availability of insects ﬂying high above the ground, restricted the diversity of the open air foragers throughout the region. We highlight additional areas of research worth investigation.",

Whereas M. mystacinus is present across the whole distribution area known for the species complex, , it seems that -according to the present sampling information- the species M. alacathoe is really not found in the Central Pyrenees, Sistema Central, Sistema Ibérico Sur and Sierras Béticas mountain massifs. Despite being sympatric in several localities, M. mystacinus reaches higher altitudes than M. alcathoe.",

Where similar species rely on similar resources in the same foraging habitat, they are likely to interact. This study addresses the trophic niche of the Northern European trawling bat species Myotis dasycneme (Boie, 1825) and Myotis daubentonii (Kuhl, 1817), occurring in the same habitat, and possible interactions or differences within their dietary behaviour. Dietary data of both species were analysed to draw conclusions on their ecology, possible dietary overlap, hints for coexistence mechanisms and community structure. In this study, M. dasycneme and M. daubentonii fed mainly on Chironomidae (M. dasycneme: 44.4%; M. daubentonii: 32.8%) and Trichoptera (M. dasycneme: 20.4%; M. daubentonii: 22.2%), showing a high trophic niche overlap and similar niche breadth. Nevertheless, there were differences in the diet of the two species concerning the predation of chironomids. Differences also occur regarding the prey types, referring to the terrestrial or aquatic life-cycle of prey groups. This could be evidence for different foraging habitats and a spatial segregation of both species. High resource abundance is also likely to allow the coexistence of both species within the same hunting habitat.",

The recordings were made in Kenya during 2013-2018, using Pettersson D500X and D1000X real time, full spectrum bat detectors. All species used highintensity constant-frequency echolocation of high duty-cycle. Most of them separate clearly in the constant-frequency component of the echolocation calls and can be recognized based on that feature alone. This study provides the first description of the echolocation calls of D. camerunensis, whereas those of H. beatus, H. ruber, and C. percivali from Kenya are also described for the first time. Additionally, call frequencies for some of these species differ from those of other parts of their range, demonstrating the need for collection and publication of more local call libraries from tropical regions.",

Apo National Park ; Balabag, Kidapawan City and Cotabato Provincial Forest and Ecotourism Park (CPFEP), Amas, Kidapawan City. Seven species were recorded in CPFEP and six were noted in Balabag area identified from 449 individuals captured. Two species (Eonycteris spelaea and Rousettus amplexicaudatus) were unique to CPFEP while one (Ptenochirus minor) was found only in Balabag area. A total of eight species were recorded when accounting the species found in two areas in which, three are endemic to the country namely Haplonycteris fischeri, Ptenochirus jagori, and P. minor. Of these endemics, the first two were noted in CPFEP while all were found in Balabag area. More than half of the bats captured were Cynopterus brachyotis hence, considered as the most common species. Remarkable finding was the presence of Megaerops wetmorei, a threatened species, to have found in a new altitudinal record. Considering the importance of fruit bats in regenerating forest, urgent conservation measures are highly recommended.",

            "abstractNote": "We estimate ﬂuctuations in population size and sex ratio, document breeding behavior and reproduction, and determine the diet of a population of the lesser long-nosed bat, Leptonycteris curasoae, in an island cave in Chamela Bay, Jalisco, Mexico, with monthly sampling during an annual cycle (October 1999–October 2000). Based on the area of the cave’s ceiling and wall covered with L. curasoae in relation to the potential roost area without them, in 1999 the abundance increased from 80% in October to 100% in November and December. In 2000 the population decreased to 80% in January, 50% in February, 30% in March, 20% in April, 10% in May, 5% in June and July, and less than 1% in August. The population rapidly increased to 60% in September and to 80% in October. Throughout the year there were signiﬁcantly more males than females; however, there was signiﬁcant heterogeneity over months. In September–November there were more females, but in December–August there were more males present. The majority of pregnant and lactating females were observed from December to March and in July, while males were reproductive from September–January and in May–June. Breeding activity was observed in the cave in November–December. Twenty-six species of plants were consumed during the year, based on pollen identiﬁcation from fecal samples. Bombacaceous species were the most important component of the diet from January to May and Cactaceae were most important in June–September. Peak abundance and reproductive activity coincided with peak ﬂower resource availability, which occurred between October and January and in June–July. The year-round presence and reproductive activity of L. curasoae at this site throughout the year demonstrate that many individuals are annual residents in this area and indicate the importance of this roosting site. In order to develop a successful conservation program for L. curasoae, in addition to protecting migratory corridors and northern maternity roosts, it is equally important to identify and protect areas that function as breeding colonies and year-round sanctuaries for resident populations in the south.",

Earlier pollen studies have suggested convergent evolution of verrucate exine ornamentation. Furthermore pollen of bat pollinated plants has been reported to be bigger than that of plants pollinated by other means. The generality of these ideas is tested using a sample of 130 species of both bat pollinated plants and relatives with another mode of pollination. An analysis of pollen size, shape, aperture number and type, and ornamentation type of 35 plant groups in which a transition towards bat pollination occurred was performed and showed a significant effect for pollen size only. Bat pollinated plants have bigger pollen than their relatives. Pollen size was shown to correlate with style length. Pollen shape, aperture system and exine ornamentation are in general not very different in bat pollinated plants in comparison with their relatives. There is no consistent trend for rougher exines to be associated with bat pollination.",

            "abstractNote": "The relationship between wing morphology and ability to manoeuvre through an obstacle course was examined in ®ve species of bats in the Neotropical family Phyllostomidae. These species represent a range of morphologies and feeding adaptations: Tonatia silvicola, a surface-gleaning insectivore; Artibeus jamaicensis and A. literatus, canopy frugivores; and Carollia perspicillata and C. castanea, understory frugivores. Bats of known morphology were presented with three different obstacle arrangements chosen in random order. In order to control for wing span, spacing between obstacles was scaled to the wing span of the individual (16, 0.756, 0.56 the wing span of the bat). Performance was measured as the number of times a bat hit an obstacle hard enough to de¯ect it. Morphological variables were analysed using principal components analysis and were summarized by the ®rst two principal components (PC): PC 1, `size', with which sizerelated variables were strongly, positively correlated; PC 2, `camber', on which variables associated with maximum depth of wing camber weighted most heavily. Obstacle course performance was signi®cantly correlated with both size and camber at all obstacle spacings: larger bats hit more obstacles, even though obstacle spacing was scaled to wing span, and bats with better ability to camber wings hit fewer obstacles. These results show that bat species that forage in more cluttered habitats are more likely to be small in size and/or have wings able to produce the high camber necessary to maintain lift at low ¯ight speeds.",

            "abstractNote": "In the biological spectrum, microchiropteran bats play a crucial role in reducing the population of pest insects. The dusky leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros ater (body wt. 3.5±0.2 g) is a well known predator of nocturnal flying insects. This species of bat keeps a check on agricultural pests while it forages during night time. An attempt has been made to study the foraging behaviour and food habit of this bat. The food items of H. ater were examined from culled parts of the prey insects collected from their feeding roosts as well as from faecal pellet analysis. In addition, a sample collection of insect pests from the foraging area is compared with the diet of this foraging bat species. The results reveal that the foraging time of H. ater and the activity period of insect pests coincide in the study area. Moreover, this bat species control major pests of stored grains (Tribolium spp) which constitute 55.83% of coleopteran, and the rest includes lepidopteran pests such as Hippotion celerio (pest of grapevine), Nausinoe geometralis (pest of jasmine), Othreis meterna, Othreis fullonica (pests of citrus and grapevine) and Nelanitis leda ismene (pest of rice) whose larvae and adults are serious pests in South India. During winter seasons, H. ater feeds on the dipteran insects, especially mosquitoes, which constitute 98.33% of the total intake. Comparison of food habit of H. ater roosting at different localities in Tirunelveli district indicates that they are selective but opportunistic in feeding their prey insects. The nocturnal foraging behaviour, echolocation capability, dentition and flight maneuverability of this bat species are the adaptations that enhance their ability to capture nocturnal prey insects in open space during their foraging flight.",

Of 20 species captured, 13 were shared between treatments, 4 were unique to continuous forest, and 3 were unique to forest fragments. Dominance-diversity curves were similar for the two treatments except that Sturnira lilium comprised 43 percent of captures in the forest fragments, resulting in greater dominance there. Capture rates (and presumably relative abundance) differed significantlybetween continuous forest and forest fragments, both in terms of species and feeding guilds. Sturnia lilium and Dermanura sp. were captured significantly more often in forest fragments than in continuous forest, whereas Artibeus jamaicensis, A. Izturatus, and Centurio senex were taken significantly more often in continuous forest. Large frugivores accounted for a higher proportion of total captures in conrinuous forest than in forest fragments, whereas small frugivores showed the opposite pattern. By their abundances, Carollia perspicilkzta and S. lilium are indicators of forest disturbance. The relative abundances of large frugivores, which feed on large fruits of mature forest trees, and small frugivores, which fced on small-fruited plants occurring in early succession, are an indicator of forest disturbance. Other groups, such as large insect- and vertebrate-eating bats, because of their low capture rates, are impractical as indicators for rapid assessment of forest disturbance based on mist netting, but may prove especially vulnerable to forest fragmentation.",

Many species are no longer able to survive in these urban areas; however, there are some that have been able to persist and even thrive in these habitats. One such species is Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi). Little is known about its existence in urban areas. Consequently we studied their seasonal variation in home range size, movements and foraging dynamics in the urban environment of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. In a pilot study in summer, adult fruit bats (n = 8) were caught, fitted with radio-transmitters, and their movements followed for 12 nights and days. Although their movements varied considerably, no bats left the urban environment. Some of the larger distances covered in a single night were 2 and 5 km. In winter, an additional ten adult fruit bats were caught and fitted with radio-transmitters. Movements were followed for three weeks during winter and spring respectively. Winter home range size was greater than spring home range size. During winter the bats fed mostly on syringa fruits (Melia azedarach), an alien invasive, while their diet in spring was more varied and included species of indigenous and exotic fruits. The reduced variety of fruit eaten in winter may be explained by a reduction in fruiting plant species, and thus a reliance on a few species to meet their dietary requirements. The bats would have a role in seed dispersal but therein lies the problem of them also dispersing invasive plants. Further research is needed to assess the role played by exotic and alien plant species in the continued success of urban wildlife, in particular fruit bats. The seasonal variation in home range size gives insight into the urban movements of Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bats. The use of exotic and invasive plants by these bats is also significant.",

In this study we compared patterns of flowering phenology and species richness between abiotically (wind) and biotically pollinated plants, using phylogenetically independent contrasts. We compiled phenological data from eight local seasonal floras, in which we found geographically overlapping sister clades. Of 65 documented origins of wind pollination, we were able to use up to 17 independent contrasts. In contrast to previous studies we found no difference in global species richness between wind- and biotically pollinated sister clades. Regarding phenology, we found wider phenological spread in biotically pollinated clades, earlier flowering onset in wind-pollinated trees, but no difference in duration of flowering between pollination modes. These results corroborate previous views that niche space is more constrained for wind-pollinated species, and that niche partitioning is less important between wind-pollinated plants compared to plants pollinated by animals.",

            "abstractNote": "Arboreal frugivores, such as primates and hornbills, are important seed dispersers for many tropical plant species, yet the degree to which they use the same resources is unknown. If primates and hornbills consume the same fruit species, they may be redundant in their roles as seed dispersers, and the loss of one of these taxa may be compensated for by the other. To examine resource use by tropical frugivores, we quantiﬁed the feeding habits of two hornbill species, Ceratogymna atrata and C. cylindricus, and ﬁve primate species, Colobus guereza, Lophocebus albigena, Cercopithecus pogonias, C. cephus, and C. nictitans, in the lowland rainforest of south-central Cameroon. Based on over 2200 feeding observations recorded between January and December 1998, we characterized the diets and estimated dietary overlap among frugivore species. Previous studies have calculated dietary overlap by counting the number of diet species that two animals share, often leading to inﬂated estimates of overlap. Our method incorporated the proportional use of diet species and fruit availability into randomization procedures, allowing a clearer assessment of the actual degree of overlap. This added complexity of analysis revealed that, although the diets of a hornbill and a primate species may have as many as 36 plant species in common, actual dietary overlap is low. These results suggested that there are distinct hornbill and primate feeding assemblages, with primates consuming a greater diversity of plant species and higher levels of nonfruit items like leaves and seeds. Using Correspondence Analysis, we also identiﬁed two primate assemblages, separated largely by degree of frugivory and folivory. In addition, we found that hornbills feed at signiﬁcantly higher strata in the forest canopy and eat fruits of different colors than primates. Averaged across the year, overlap between groups (hornbill–primate) was signiﬁcantly lower than combined within-group overlap (primate–primate and hornbill–hornbill), showing that primates and hornbills have dissimilar diets and are not redundant as seed dispersers. In equatorial Africa, primate populations face greater declines than hornbill populations because of hunting. It is unlikely that seed dispersal by hornbills will compensate for the loss of primates in maintaining forest structure.",
