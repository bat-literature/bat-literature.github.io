The use of public information can lead to the aggregation of foragers at prey patches, a mechanism known as local enhancement. However, when ephemeral resources are distributed over large areas, foragers may also need to increase search efficiency, and thus apply social strategies when sampling the landscape. While sensory networks of visually oriented animals have already been confirmed, we lack an understanding of how acoustic eavesdropping adds to the formation of sensory networks. Here we radio-tracked a total of 81 aerial-hawking bats at very high spatiotemporal resolution during five sessions over 3 y, recording up to 19 individuals simultaneously. Analyses of interactive flight behavior provide conclusive evidence that bats form temporary mobile sensory networks by adjusting their movements to neighboring conspecifics while probing the airspace for prey. Complementary agent-based simulations confirmed that the observed movement patterns can lead to the formation of mobile sensory networks, and that bats located prey faster when networking than when relying only on local enhancement or searching solitarily. However, the benefit of networking diminished with decreasing group size. The combination of empirical analyses and simulations elucidates how animal groups use acoustic information to efficiently locate unpredictable and ephemeral food patches. Our results highlight that declining local populations of social foragers may thus suffer from Allee effects that increase the risk of collapses under global change scenarios, like insect decline and habitat degradation.",

Yet, recent studies highlight that so-called green energy, such as wind energy, may come at environmental costs, for example when wind turbines kill birds and bats. Using miniaturized GPS loggers, we studied how an open-space foraging bat with high collision risk with wind turbines, the common noctule\n              Nyctalus noctula\n              (Schreber, 1774), interacts with wind turbines. We compared actual flight trajectories to correlated random walks to identify habitat variables explaining the movements of bats. Both sexes preferred wetlands but used conventionally managed cropland less than expected based on availability. During midsummer, females traversed the land on relatively long flight paths and repeatedly came close to wind turbines. Their flight heights above ground suggested a high risk of colliding with wind turbines. In contrast, males recorded in early summer commuted straight between roosts and foraging areas and overall flew lower than the operating range of most turbine blades, suggesting a lower collision risk. Flight heights of bats suggest that during summer the risk of collision with wind turbines was high for most studied bats at the majority of currently installed wind turbines. For siting of wind parks, preferred bat habitats and commuting routes should be identified and avoided.",

While the competitive exclusion principle suggests that species can only coexist if their ecological niches show considerable differences, newer theory proposes that local coexistence can be facilitated by so-called stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms. A prerequisite to identify such mechanisms is the understanding of the strength and the nature of competition (i.e., interference or exploitation). We studied the interaction between two open-space foraging bats by testing if common noctule bats Nyctalus noctula shift their space use in response to simulated aggregations of conspeciﬁcs or heterospeciﬁc Pipistrellus nathusii. When confronted with playbacks of heterospeciﬁcs, N. noctula increased their activity in early summer, but decreased activity in late summer. This pattern was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of large insects in late summer, suggesting a more intense competition for food in late compared to early summer. When confronted with playbacks of conspeciﬁcs, N. noctula did not change their activity, irrespective of season. Our results indicate that in early summer, intraspeciﬁc competition is more severe than interspeciﬁc competition for insectivorous bats. Likely, conspeciﬁcs engage in interference competition for ﬂight space, and may suffer from reduced prey detectability as echolocation calls of conspeciﬁcs interfere with each other. During insect rich times, interspeciﬁc competition on the other hand may be mediated by ﬁne scale vertical partitioning and the use non-interfering echolocation frequencies. In contrast, when food is scarce in late summer, bats may engage in exploitation competition. Our data suggests that N. noctula avoid aggregations of more agile bats like P. nathusii, probably due to impeded hunting success. Yet, as fast and efﬁcient ﬂiers, N. noctula may be able to escape this disadvantage by exploiting more distant foraging patches.",

            "abstractNote": "In anthropogenic landscapes, aerial insectivores are often confronted with variable habitat complexity, which may influence the distribution of prey. Yet, high mobility may allow aerial insectivores to adjust their foraging strategy to different prey distributions. We investigated whether aerial-hunting common noctules Nyctalus noctula adjust their foraging strategy to landscapes with different habitat complexity and assumingly different prey distribution. We hypothesized that the movement behaviour of hunting common noctules and changes of movement behaviour in reaction towards conspecifics would depend on whether they hunt in a structurally poor cropland dominated landscape or a structurally rich forest dominated landscape. We tracked flight paths of common noctules in northeastern Germany using GPS loggers equipped with an ultrasonic microphone that recorded foraging events and presence of conspecifics. Above cropland, common noctules hunted mainly during bouts of highly tortuous and area restricted movements (ARM). Bats switched from straight flight to ARM after encountering conspecifics. In the forested landscape, common noctules hunted both during ARM and during straight flights. The onset of ARM did not correlate with the presence of conspecifics. Common noctules showed a lower feeding rate and encountered more conspecifics above the forested than above the cropland dominated landscape. We conjecture that prey distribution above cropland was patchy and unpredictable, thus making eavesdropping on hunting conspecifics crucial for bats during search for prey patches. In contrast, small scale structural diversity of the forested landscape possibly led to a more homogeneous prey distribution at the landscape scale, thus enabling bats to find sufficient food independent of conspecific presence. This suggests that predators depending on ephemeral prey can increase their foraging success in structurally poor landscapes by using social information provided by conspecifics. Hence, a minimum population density might be obligatory to enable successful foraging in simplified landscapes.",

The vast majority of studies in this area have only considered the diversity of species within an environment as an overall measure of biodiversity, overlooking the role of genetic diversity within a particular host species. Although theoretical models propose that host genetic diversity in part shapes that of the infecting parasite population, and hence modulates the risk of parasite emergence, this effect has seldom been tested empirically. Using Rabies virus (RABV) as a model parasite, we provide evidence that greater host genetic diversity increases both parasite genetic diversity and the likelihood of a host being a donor in RABV cross-species transmission events. We conclude that host genetic diversity may be an important determinant of parasite evolution and emergence.",

            "abstractNote": "The Corynorhinus mexicanus bat provides an interesting experimental model for the study of epididymal sperm maturation because after testicular regression, this bat stores sperm in epididymal cauda for several months. Earlier research conducted by our group suggested that sperm maturation in this specie must be completed in the caudal region of the epididymis, although the precise factor linked with this phenomenon is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this work was to analyze changes in the distribution of N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic acid, Fucose and Mannose carbohydrates in different membrane domains of sperm cells as they change from the caput to the cauda of the epididymis, as well as, their changes in different dates of capture. The sperm cells present a redistribution of N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic when they arrived in the caudal region (September 11), but after storage until October 22 the distribution of N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic acid changed. Mannose residues were found predominantly towards the acrosome during their entry into and transit through the three regions of the epididymis. The flow cytometry assay indicated that fluorescence intensity due to the presence of of N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic acid on the sperm decreases as the sperm pass through the epididymal duct and as storage time in the cauda goes on. The Mannose fluorescence intensity, decreased in corpus and cauda from September 24 to October 8, though no differences appeared on the latter date. The presence of Fucuse was corroborated only by flow cytometry. In conclusion, the carbohydrate distribution on sperm membrane can be considered as part of the process of epididymal sperm maturation and is associated with the phenomenon of prolonged sperm storage that is characteristic of this specie. This adaptation allows the males to synchronize with the period of receptivity of the females, and then, carry out the matings.",

            "abstractNote": "Landscape composition and heterogeneity are considered important factors for enhancing biodiversity and their associated ecosystem services in human-modiﬁed landscapes. Despite their roles in pest suppression in agricultural areas, insectivorous bats have been poorly represented in studies assessing the eﬀects of landscape structural changes, particularly in the Neotropics. We evaluated how the composition and heterogeneity of the landscape, at several spatial scales, inﬂuenced the diversity and activity of aerial insectivorous bats in organic vineyards. Bat activity was quantiﬁed using acoustic surveys at 16 vineyards distributed across the central zone of Chile, where landscape composition and heterogeneity were determined by spatial analysis (GIS). Data were analyzed using partial least square regressions (PLS). The diversity and activity of aerial insectivorous bats in vineyards increased with the compositional and conﬁgurational heterogeneity of the landscape. Bat diversity and species richness in vineyards increased as the area covered by native vegetation increased, and urban areas decreased. Total bat activity, feeding activity and the activity of the dominant species T. brasiliensis increased with the diversity of cover types in the landscape, and also as the area covered by annual crops and rural areas increased. This study highlights the importance of agricultural landscape composition and heterogeneity for aerial insectivorous bats in organic vineyards. Eﬀective conservation eﬀorts and management strategies in this crop should aim to increase cover diversiﬁcation at the landscape scale. In addition, retaining native forest remnants around or within vineyards may promote bat conservation and their role as suppressors of crop pests in these production landscapes.",

We compared bat activity in Monterrey pine plantations with and without an understory in central Chile. Total activity did not differ between plantations with a developed understory and those without it, being higher on-track than off-tracks sites. Trails provide commuting areas for bats within plantations allowing its use regardless of their degree of structural clutter. Promoting understory in plantations provides habitats for bats and might enhance their conservation in human-modified landscapes.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats play a crucial role in agroecosystems by providing invaluable pest control services. With the escalating impacts of climate change, a comprehensive understanding of the environmental factors influencing bat activity becomes imperative for their conservation in agricultural landscapes. This study investigates the influence of weather conditions, specifically air temperature and relative humidity, on the timing activity and the relative abundance of five insectivorous bat species in central Chile. Data from automatic bat detectors and climatological stations are utilized for analysis. Our results unveil species-specific behaviors, with Tadarida brasiliensis exhibiting early emergence and extended activity periods compared to other bat species. Histiotus montanus and Lasiurus villosissimus display delayed onsets on more humid evenings, whereas Lasiurus varius and T. brasiliensis initiate activity earlier on colder nights compared to warmer ones. Relative humidity emerges as a key factor influencing relative abundance for all species, with more minutes with bat passes detected on drier nights. These findings suggest that global warming may influence observed bat behaviors, potentially altering foraging patterns and activity levels of these bat species. Moreover, as climate change continues, understanding the long-term impact on bat populations and their adaptive strategies is crucial for effective conservation measures. Further studies exploring these dynamics can provide valuable insights for shaping conservation efforts in the face of evolving environmental challenges.",

Recognizing the importance of bats to suppress pest populations and further conserve their populations near agricultural systems could reduce damage to crops thereby potentially increasing the monetary gain of farmers. Viticulture represents one of the most extensive and economically important agricultural crops in the Mediterranean biome. While pest consumption by bats has been recently revealed in vineyards, direct evidence of the reduction of grapevine pests by bats in vineyards is lacking, and their beneﬁts to winegrape production remains to be quantiﬁed. Using large nocturnal exclosures in vineyards, we examined the top-down eﬀects of aerial insectivorous bats in suppressing insect populations by assessing leaf and grape cluster damage; we also examined the beneﬁt of these natural pest predators by quantifying resulting increases in potential vineyard yield. Grapevine plants excluded from bats had signiﬁcantly higher leaf herbivory and greater grape cluster damage than control plots. Grape cluster damage was 7% lower on control plots, yielding an average economic beneﬁt of US$188-$248/ha/year due to bat predation. These results provide the ﬁrst experimental evidence that bats reduce grapevine pest insect infections and thus increase vineyard yield and winegrowers’ income. Therefore, bats should be included in future biodiversity conservation plans in vineyards and be considered within agricultural management strategies based on natural pest suppression.",

La morfología externa y craneana de la especie fue homogénea y el análisis de dimorfismo sexual secundario de las poblaciones de la región Pacífico no mostró diferencias significativas, sin embargo la longitud de la tibia y la profundidad de la caja craneana son proporcionalmente mayores en los machos y el ancho zigomático en las hembras. Respecto a labiología reproductiva sugerimos que las poblaciones de V. nymphaea presentan un patrón poliéstrico sin picos definidos a lo largo del año.",

However, nectar-feeding bats do not exhibit preferences for the sugars present in their diet. We analyzed the role that biochemical and ecological factors could play in shaping the nectar traits of chiropterophilic plants. We studied nectar traits and ﬂower production in 49 plant species. We evaluated the relationship between nectar concentration and sugar composition using phylogenetically independent contrasts and if nectar traits were related to ﬂower production using a Manova. We found that 42 species produced high hexoses nectars, and 7 species produced sucrose rich nectars. Phylogenetically independent contrasts showed that nectar concentration was negatively related to glucose content, positively related to fructose content, and was not related to sucrose content. A negative relationship was found from glucose and fructose contents to sucrose content, and glucose content was negatively related to fructose content. Finally, we did not found any relationship between nectar traits and the plants’ ﬂowering strategies. We conclude that bat physiology and the relative low evolutionary time of the interaction between plants and bats may determine the lack of pattern in the nectar characteristics of chiropterophilic plants.",

Leptonycteris yerbabuenae (20 g mass) were injected with or fed inert carbohydrate probes L-rhamnose and D(+)-cellobiose, which are absorbed exclusively by the paracellular route, and 3-O-methyl-Dglucose (3OMD-glucose), which is absorbed both paracellularly and transcellularly. Using a standard pharmacokinetic technique, we collected blood samples for 2 h after probe administration. As predicted, fractional absorption ( f ) of paracellular probes declined with increasing Mr in the order of rhamnose ( f=0.71)>cellobiose ( f=0.23). Absorption of 3OMD-glucose was complete ( f=0.85; not different from unity). Integrating our data with those for glucose absorption and oxidation in another nectarivorous bat, we conclude that passive paracellular absorption of glucose is extensive in nectarivorous bat species, as in other bats and small birds, and necessary to support high glucose fluxes hypothesized for the sugar oxidation cascade.",

In this contribution, we extend the known distribution of P. leucoptera 260 km NE and P. pallidoptera 290 km NE. Our records are from three specimens collected in a mammal assessment at the riparian corridor of the river Meta in the Vichada department. This locality is the northern limit of the distributional range of both species. We highlight the need to continue the fieldwork on mammals inventories with specimen collections through the Colombian Llanos. We call attention to the importance of horizontal rotten logs as roost of P. leucoptera and other little known neotropical bats.",

The present study sought to determine the size of the home range of Myotis atacamensis and Amorphochilus schnablii in coastal valleys of Arequipa for the generation of efficient management and conservation plans. Both species are under some category of conservation (M. atacamensis, Endangered; A. schnablii, Vulnerable), due to loss of extension and quality of habitat in their distribution area, in addition to the limited knowledge of them. In 2019, Holohil LB-2X VHF radio transmitters were installed on 12 individuals, obtaining bat’s positions using the homing-in-the-animal method. The size of the home range (HR) was estimated with the methods: convex minimum polygon and bivariate kernel function. The HR size for M. atacamensis was 2.1 ± 1.6 ha on cultivated areas, and for A. shnablii it was 24.2 ± 27.1 ha on arid zones and cultivated areas. The results suggest that the use of spaces of M. atacamensis and A. schnablii are mainly oriented to the availability of food, registering greater importance of the cultivation areas in the home range.",

Furthermore, the microclimate of roosts is a crucial element for bat survival, and modified leaves are used for roosting (“tents”) by 22 species of bats. Our objective was to determine whether the inverted boat tents used by Ectophylla alba and pinnate tents used by Uroderma bilobatum provide energetic benefits. We measured the ambient temperature under modified and unmodified leaves (UMLs) of Heliconia imbricata and Cocos nucifera . We also measured temperature with (simulated bat presence) and without a heat source, and finally we measured bat energy expenditure at different temperatures. Our results show that when a heat source is present tents conserve heat better than a UML. The energy expenditure of E. alba and U. bilobatum increased up to 55% and 48%, respectively, with a decrease of temperature from 25°C to 20°C. We concluded that since the temperature at our study site drops below 25°C every night and remains that way until mid-morning, using a “tent” that maintains a temperature higher than ambient temperature, or close to 25°C degrees, provides an energetic advantage.\n            La selección del refugio en los mamíferos es una presión selectiva importante y muchos animales encuentran refugio en estructuras ya existentes. El microclima del refugio es un elemento crucial para la sobrevivencia de los murciélagos. Las hojas modificadas (tiendas) son utilizadas por 22 especies de murciélagos. Nuestro objetivo era determinar si la tienda de bote invertido utilizada por Ectophylla alba y tiendas pinnadas utilizadas por Uroderma bilobatum brindan un beneficio energético a los murciélagos. Se midió la temperatura bajo hojas modificadas y no modificadas de Heliconia imbricata y Cocos nucifera . Además se midió la temperatura con fuente (simulando la presencia de murciélagos) y sin fuente de calor, finalmente se midió el gasto energético de los murciélagos a diferentes temperaturas. Los resultados muestran que cuando hay una fuente de calor presente, la tienda conserva el calor mejor que una hoja no modificada. El gasto energético de E. alba y U. bilobatum puede incrementarse hasta 55% y 48%, respectivamente, cuando la temperatura decrece entre 25°C y 20°C. Concluimos que como la temperatura en este sitio de estudio baja de los 25°C cada noche y hasta media mañana, utilizar una tienda que mantiene la temperatura arriba o cerca de los 25°C, provee una ventaja energética.",

            "abstractNote": "Centurio senex\n              is an iconic bat characterized by a facial morphology deviating far from all other New World Leaf Nosed Bats (Phyllostomidae). The species has a bizarrely wrinkled face and lacks the characteristic nose leaf. Throughout its distribution from Mexico to Northern South America the species is most of the time rarely captured and only scarce information on its behavior and natural history is available.\n              Centurio senex\n              is frugivorous and one of the few bats documented to consume also hard seeds. Interestingly, the species shows a distinct sexual dimorphism: Adult males have more pronounced facial wrinkles than females and a fold of skin under the chin that can be raised in style of a face mask. We report the first observations on echolocation and mating behavior of\n              Centurio senex\n              , including synchronized audio and video recordings from an aggregation of males in Costa Rica. Over a period of 6 weeks we located a total of 53 perches, where during the first half of the night males were hanging with raised facial masks at a mean height of 2.35 m. Most of the time, the males moved just their wing tips, and spontaneously vocalized in the ultrasound range. Approaches of other individuals resulted in the perching male beating its wings and emitting a very loud, low frequency whistling call. Following such an encounter we recorded a copulation event. The observed aggregation of adult\n              C\n              .\n              senex\n              males is consistent with lek courtship, a behavior described from only few other bat species.",

Based on published data, new descriptions and reports, we here present an updated list of all terrestrial and aquatic Costa Rican mammals. We summarize available information on their status, and present our concerns regarding those species with populations under alarming conditions. The mammalian fauna of Costa Rica is mainly Neotropical. A total of 238 species, grouped in 140 genera and 44 families, were documented. The order Chiroptera is the most diverse, followed by Rodentia, Cetacea, and Carnivora. About 7% of the species are endemic to Costa Rica (or Costa Rica-Nicaragua, Costa Rica-Panamá). Unfortunately, despite of all the efforts to protect our fauna and flora, threat to Costa Rican mammals is increasing, and a number of species have gone, and are going extinct. As in most other areas, habitat loss, both in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, poses the greatest threat to mammalian diversity of Costa Rica. Other factors, such as poaching, inappropriate gear used in fisheries, and other human exploitation are also threatening mammal populations in Costa Rica. Future conservation efforts should focus on more detailed conservation and management strategies, particularly of large mammals (e.g. monkeys, felids).",

            "abstractNote": "Bats show the greatest variety of mating strategies in mammals. Social structure can be influenced by roost characteristics, for example, if the roost is defendable and its availability limited, it becomes an important resource that partially determines the mating system type. In the species that use tents as roosting sites, it has been suggested that males can defend the tent in order to attract and have access to females. Ectophylla alba is an obligate and exclusive tent user, and it has to build tents periodically. Its mating system has been classified as polygyny by its resource defense, and it has a temporary group structure of one male and several females. This study seeks to determine the composition and stability of the groups of this species and to learn whether males defend the tent or the females in it in order to gain copulations. This study was conducted in 2006 in Tirimbina, Biological Reserve in Sarapiquí, Costa Rica, where groups of bats were captured (N = 38). The individuals were marked (N = 98), and their reproductive status was determined. The behavior of the individuals was recorded with video cameras and infrared light (300 h total). Throughout the year, some individuals were more closely associated to other individuals, determining that groups are stable independent of the reproductive season. The proportion of males in the groups does not vary according to reproductive season, and in most groups, there is more than one adult male. The males spend different amounts of time in the tents and do not show antagonistic behavior with other members of the group. Based on the social structure, the classification of the mating system should change to Ba stable group of several males and females,^ which may be confirmed in the near future by the results of an ongoing paternity study.",

Twelve of the 13 species present in the region were detected. It took nine nights of net and acoustic monitoring to detect 69% of the species, and 44 nights to reach 92%. Diversity was high, considering the insular nature of the assemblage and the fragmented nature of the ecosystem. We did not detect any important seasonal pattern in bat activity. The fruit eating bats at this study site are important importers of various seeds. Artibeus jamaicensis was most frequently captured and it appears to breed throughout the year at this location. Our results have important implications for management and conservation of biological diversity on tropical islands, and set a baseline against which the effect of further urban encroachment can be compared.",

These roosts may function as shelter from weather or predators, information and social centers, or as nurseries. We provide estimates of bat population from 12 hot caves in Puerto Rico, based on infrared reflectance technology. Populations ranged from a few thousands of individuals to several hundred thousand. At nine caves, estimates were performed twice at different periods during the reproductive cycle. Some caves showed notable variations in the size of the population. A database of caves used by bats throughout the island is also provided, as well as information on the species that have been identified at each cave.",

The post-construction monitoring includes observed fatalities and a corrected fatality estimate expressed as bats/ turbine/year adjusted for bat carcass removal rates, searcher efficiency, and percent area searched. Data on seasonality of fatalities and distance of carcasses from turbines is also provided. Eleven out of the 13 species of bats in Puerto Rico suffered fatalities, including all five species of phyllostomids. These were: Molossus molossus and Tadarida brasiliensis (Molossidae); Artibeus jamaicensis, Monophyllus redmani, Stenoderma rufum, Brachyphylla cavernarum and Erophylla bombifrons (Phyllostomidae); Noctilio leporinus (Noctilionidae); Eptesicus fuscus and Lasiurus minor (Vespertilionidae); and Mormoops blainvillei (Mormoopidae). This is one of the first published reports of the impact of wind turbines on bats in the Neotropics.",

The specimen referred here was compared with cranial materials of other Cuban bats, with analysis of qualitative and quantitative characters, as well as with measurements, photos, and existing drawings in the bibliography. This nataleid is currently extirpated in most of the Cuban territory, with only a relict population in a cave in the western end of the archipelago. The present finding of N. primus demonstrates the diversity of Chiroptera that once existed in the region where the fossil deposit treated here is located.",

            "abstractNote": "Several hypotheses attempt to explain the latitudinal gradient of species diversity, but some basic aspects of the pattern remain insufficiently explored, including the effect of scales and the role of beta diversity. To explore such components of the latitudinal gradient, we tested the hypothesis of covariation, which states that the gradient of species diversity should show the same pattern regardless of the scale of analysis. The hypothesis implies that there should be no gradients of beta diversity, of regional range size within regions, and of the slope of the species‐area curve. For the fauna of North American mammals, we found contrasting results for bats and non‐volant species. We could reject the hypothesis of covariation for non‐volant mammals, for which the number of species increases towards lower latitudes, but at different rates depending on the scale. Also, for this group, beta diversity is higher at lower latitudes, the regional range size within regions is smaller at lower latitudes, and z, the slope of the species‐area relationship is higher at lower latitudes. Contrarily bats did not show significant deviations from the predictions of the hypothesis of covariation: at two different scales, species richness shows similar trends of increase at lower latitudes, and no gradient can be demonstrated for beta diversity, for regional range size, or for the slopes of the species‐area curve. Our results show that the higher diversity of non‐volant mammals in tropical areas of North America is a consequence of the increase in beta diversity and not of higher diversity at smaller scales. In contrast, the diversity of bats at both scales is higher at lower latitudes. These contrasting patterns suggest different causes for the latitudinal gradient of species diversity in the two groups that are ultimately determined by differences in the patterns of geographic distribution of the species.",
