We examined bat strike records from Australia during 1996–2006 and found that risk of impact from bats is increasing, is greatest in tropical versus temperate regions, and is more likely during early evening and while an aircraft is landing rather than departing. Temporal patterns of bat strikes differ from those of birds, highlighting the need to employ taxon‐specific management strategies to minimize animal impacts on the aviation industry. The use of genetics for identification of strike remains and the implementation of nocturnal survey techniques by wildlife managers at airports will contribute to the mitigation of bat strikes.",

            "abstractNote": "The olfactory capacity in bats and their strong preference for some fruits has led to the development of a forest restoration tool that uses the essential oils of their preferred fruit. The idea is based on the assumption that, once these bats were attracted by olfactory cues from the essential oils to a “new food source,” they would spend a certain amount of time flying around these new food sources. This technique has great potential for natural methods of regeneration assisted by dispersers, increasing arrival of chiropterochoric seeds in areas that otherwise may not be frequently visited by frugivorous bats. Although we developed this technique on Neotropical species, we believe it has the potential to be used around the world to recover degraded forests. Here, we explore parallels between New (Phyllostomidae) and Old World (Pteropodidae) seed dispersing bats to support this proposal. Review data showed that Cynopterus, Pteropus, and Rousettus seem to be the closest functional genera to those (Artibeus, Carollia, Sturnira) tested in the Neotropical region, based on their wide distribution, diet diversity and great consumption of Ficus - whose oils are known to attract fruit bats. Experi­ ments need to be designed to further develop the technique to apply it to the Old World and contribute to the restoration of degraded forests.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate, in captivity, the behavioural response (number of foraging attempts) of Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata offered essential oils extracted from ripe fruit of Ficus insipida (Moraceae) and Piper hispidum (Piperaceae) as well as intact fruit wrapped in gauze to attract bats with reduced visual stimuli. Based on previous reports, we hypothesized that A. lituratus would exhibit preference for Ficus fruits/oil while C. perspicillata would prefer Piper fruit/oil. Four arrangements of these attractants were tested in triplicate: P. hispidum fruit vs. F. insipida fruit, P. hispidum oil vs. F. insipida oil, P. hispidum oil vs. F. insipida fruit and P. hispidum fruit vs. F. insipida oil. As expected, in all tests, A. lituratus showed the highest number of foraging attempts in F. insipida while C. perspicillata in those of P. hispidum. Based on the number of foraging attempts both species exhibited a positive response to their favorite fruit genera, though the differences were not always statistically significant. The results confirm the importance of smell in fruit choice by these species.",

We performed a quantified literature review to test the hypothesis that interactions with plants are consistent throughout the bats´ geographic ranges. Through an extensive literature review we obtained a total of 4,448 records of fruit consumption from 180 publications. To test which fruits were most frequently consumed across the Neotropical region and in each of its component countries these data were organized by bat species and country. In general, considering the 176 botanical genera eaten by these bats, the results showed a high consumption frequency of Ficus (24.0%) by Artibeus, Piper (38.7%) by Carollia and Solanum (31.0%) by Sturnira. Additionally, our findings support the hypothesis of diet consistency throughout the geographic range of these genera. We suggest that this consistency is related to the wide distribution of the study groups (both bats and plants), the phenology of the zoochoric species consumed, the spatial fidelity of bats and the foraging patterns of the different bat species.",

Five species are recognised: P: atrata and P. pulchra from Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands; P. anceps from Bougainville and Buka Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Choiseul and Isabel Islands, Solomon Islands; and P. acrodonta from Taveuni, Fiji. A new species is described from New Georgia and Vangunu Islands, Solomon Islands. It resembles P. pulchra but differs in dental, cranial and pelage characters. A number of criteria previously considered diagnostic for P. anceps are shown to be invalid. The new species faces a high extinction risk from logging operations and pressure from expanding human populations, and an IUCN threat category of 'Critically Endangered' is proposed. All Pteralopex species face a high risk of extinction and conservation measures such as habitat protection are urgently required.",

These were published from 1875 to 1887, five by N.N. Miklouho-Maclay and seven by E.P. Ramsay, of which six are currently considered valid taxa. Six type specimens are identified in the Collection for the first time. This includes rediscovery of the holotype skull of the New Guinean forest wallaby Dorcopsis chalmersii Miklouho-Maclay not reported since its description in 1884, a likely syntype of the bandicoot Perameles macroura torosa Ramsay, and three additional syntypes of the flying fox Pteropus (Epomops?) epularius Ramsay. The holotype of the dasyurid Antechinus (Podabrus) froggatti Ramsay, housed at the Australian Museum since before 1959, is also discussed. Limited specimen data currently prevents validation of an additional six specimens identified here as suspected syntypes of four further names: the macropodoids Halmaturus mastersii Krefft, Halmaturus crassipes Ramsay and Hypsiprymnodon moschatus Ramsay, and the bandicoot Perameles moresbyensis Ramsay. Individual accounts are given for a total of 21 proposed names. Type material of four of these remain unlocated in world collections and it is not known if they were ever in the Macleay Collections: the bandicoot Brachymelis garagassi Miklouho-Maclay, 1884; the wallaby Macropus tibol Miklouho-Maclay, 1885; the cuscus Cuscus chrysorrhous var. goldiei Ramsay and the giant rat Hapalotis papuanus Ramsay. The nomenclatural status of the possum Phalangista pinnata Ramsay, 1877, a possible nomen nudum, is also discussed. No nomenclatural actions are taken in this paper.",

However, its geographic attribution to Timor is contentious because of uncertainty regarding the characteristics and the identity of the type material of timoriensis, and because no further specimens from Timor have been available until now. Here, we report on three specimens of Nyctophilus collected in 2003 at Maubisse, in the mountains of Timor-Leste (East Timor), which we tentatively assign to N. timoriensis. We present a revised concept of N. timoriensis based on a re-interpretation of the original description and illustration, as well as examination of the suspected holotype. Our assessment differs from the prevailing view of timoriensis as representing a large-bodied Nyctophilus with a rudimentary snout mound (similar to the Australian species N. major Gray, 1844, with which it has often incorrectly been synonymized). Instead, N. timoriensis is a medium-sized species with an enlarged snout mound, closely resembling N. heran Kitchener et al., 1991, from Lembata Island, Indonesia, and N. geoffroyi Leach, 1821, of mainland Australia and Tasmania. Further revisionary work is needed to resolve the taxonomy and relationships of these similar species.",

The Expedition spent five months in New Guinea with the primary objectives of survey and biological exploration. The type locality of the murid rodent Melomys muscalis froggatti Troughton, 1937, described from a single specimen obtained during the Expedition, is localized to the region of the base camp at Observation Bend, Strickland River, based on the original Expedition maps and the unpublished diary reminiscence of the collector W. W. Froggatt. A review of the mammal collection obtained during that Expedition has not been reported previously, perhaps due to the poor surviving documentation. Several months after the Expedition returned to Sydney, Australian Museum curator E. P. Ramsay prepared a list of 22 mammal specimens received by the Museum. Twenty specimens attributed to the Expedition were not entered into the collection registers until 1913, half of which are likely to be incorrectly associated with the Expedition. Most specimens were registered with very limited data about collection date and locality. Of the 22 specimens originally received by Ramsay, eight rodents and two flying foxes (Pteropus spp.) have not been located in the Collection, but might remain unrecognized as specimens with no data. It is possible that additional mammal specimens were sent by the Geographical Society of Australasia to other institutions at the conclusion of the Expedition.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Low winter temperatures are a major driver of hibernation and migration in temperate North American bats. Hibernation and migration in turn affect bat mortality via white-nose syndrome and collisions with wind turbines. To describe winter bat acoustic activity across a wide temperature gradient and to understand species-specific responses to low temperatures, we recorded nightly acoustic activity of bats at 15 sites across the state of North Carolina, United States, from December through February 2016 – 2018. Bat acoustic activity was recorded at all sites during both winters. Nightly probability of bat acoustic presence regressed positively on ambient temperature. Nightly probability of presence in Lasionycteris noctivagans (silver-haired bat) and Eptesicus fuscus (big brown bat) regressed negatively on wind speed. The mean probability of presence within the same winter condition was highest for L. noctivagans, followed by E. fuscus, Perimyotis subflavus (tricolored bat), and Lasiurus cinereus (hoary bat). Differences in species’ mean body weight and roosting preference explained part of the variation of the species-specific probability of presence. Our results can be used to predict bat acoustic presence for these species across the southeastern United States in winter, and better understand the potential threats to bats such as white-nose syndrome and wind turbine interactions.",

            "abstractNote": "Wetland construction can mitigate the biodiversity and water quality losses associated with reduced natural wetland coverage. While beneficial effects of wetland construction for bats have been observed in natural and rural settings, the effects of wetland construction on bats in an urban ecosystem are less understood. We used passive acoustic monitoring to measure bat activity levels and diversity at two constructed wetlands and two control sites on the University of North Carolina Greensboro campus, in Greensboro, North Carolina, USA. We monitored all 4 sites before and after wetland construction. Pre-wetland construction, there were few differences in bat activity and community structure at our sites. After wetland construction, we observed greater activity, attributable to all species we recorded, at wetland sites compared to control sites. Species diversity and species richness were also higher at wetland sites compared to control sites. When comparing the same sites before and after wetland construction, both bat activity and species richness increased after construction, but the effects were seen in Winter and not Spring. Our results demonstrate that bats use constructed wetlands in urban ecosystems similarly to other habitat settings. Increases in bat activity, diversity, and species richness occurred within one year of wetland construction.",

We document the northwestern extent of bats in North America using museum holdings, literature records, and field research in Alaska. Six bat species are confirmed from Alaska: Myotis lucifugus, M. keenii, M. californicus, M. volans, Lasionycteris noctivagans, and Eptesicus fuscus. M. lucifugus occurs throughout much of Alaska south of the Arctic Circle, whereas four other species occur only in Southeast Alaska. Climate, roost availability, extent of forested habitat, geographic barriers, length of night, and prey abundance appear to influence the distribution of bats in Alaska, although the relative contribution of these factors is unknown.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats are a difficult group of mammals to survey because they are small, nocturnal, fly and often roost in hard to reach places during the day. However, bats should not be neglected from biodiversity assessments because they play pivotal roles in pest regulation and as biological indicators. We used acoustic detectors to sample bat species richness at three sites within the Mapungubwe National Park (MNP), South Africa during the austral winter and summer of 2013. A minimum of 11 species from six families were recorded, with the clutter-edge foraging bats (Miniopteridae and Vespertilionidae) and open-air foraging bats (Molossidae), dominating. Bat activity was significantly higher in summer compared to winter and this is likely linked to higher prey availability and reduced thermoregulatory costs at this time. Our results represent the first assessment of bat species richness in the MNP and our data compare favourably with historical records for the region. In addition, we provide evidence for the presence of at least one undescribed species. We advocate the use of acoustic detectors for future bat surveys as long as comprehensive reference call library data are available.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats are vital components of tropical and subtropical ecosystems in Africa. However, they are not only threatened by habitat fragmentation, agriculture and urbanization but are also difficult animals to study. During 2014, we used acoustic monitoring to assess the activity and relative abundance of three functional guilds of insectivorous bats at eight sites along the Chobe River floodplain, Botswana. The activity of clutter and clutter-edge foragers was significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season. By contrast, open-air foragers, which typically forage above or away from vegetation, were more active in the wet season than in the dry season. We believe that the availability of natural vegetation and the variability in the detection of the three bat functional guilds by our acoustic detectors likely explain our results. Although bats are volant animals, our study points towards the importance of conserving important structural vegetation elements along the Chobe River floodplain landscape. Large river systems in Africa, such as the Chobe River, are vital for insectivorous bat persistence, and the provision of the ecosystem services they provide. As such, conservation of riparian corridors along rivers is crucial for maintaining intact and diverse bat communities.",

Bat distribution was monitored in lava tubes, sea caves, cave encampments and eco-corridors from July, 2006 to June, 2015. Bat specimens were also confirmed at the museums in Jeju Island. From the present study, we found 8 species of 6 genera belong to 3 families, which was different from the records had previously described in Jeju Island since 1928. Five species (Rhinolophus ferrumequium, Myotis bombinus, M. formosus, M. macrodactylus and Miniopterus schreibersi) were commonly found to live in lava tubes and cave enforcements. But only R. ferrumequium was found in a sea cave and five species including Murina leucogaster and Pipistrellus abramus were found in eco-corridors. We have also found seven species including Tadarida insignis in the specimens stored in local museums. From the results of this study, we actually could not found the remaining seven species (Hypsugo savii, Miniopterus fuscus, Myotis mystacinus, Myotis ikonnikovi, Myotis branditii, Myotis petax and Pipistrellus endoi). Interestingly, Myotis formosus which is known as one of endangered species and Myotis bombinus which is very rare in Korean Peninsula were currently found in Jeju Island. In addition, Tube-nosed bat (Murina leucogaster) that was discovered for the first time through this study. A variety of habitats for Chiroptera were identified, but the information is still not sufficient to understand. These results will be useful to provide a fundamental data in preserving the diversity of bats and in ecological study in Jeju Island.",

Fly larvae developing on ﬁlter beds at STWs may similarly provide a valuable resource for foraging bats. Over the last two decades, however, there has been a decline in ﬁlter beds towards a system of ‘activated sludge’. Insects and bat activity were surveyed at 30 sites in Scotland using these two different types of sewage treatment in order to assess the possible implications of these changes for foraging bats. Bat activity (number of passes) recorded from broad-band bat detectors was quantiﬁed at three points within each site. The biomass of aerial insects, sampled over the same period as the detector surveys, was measured using a suction trap. The biomass of insects and activity of Pipistrellus spp. were signiﬁcantly higher at ﬁlter beds than at activated sludge sites. In addition, although foraging activity of Pipistrellus spp. at ﬁlter beds was comparable to that of adjacent ‘good’ foraging habitat, foraging at activated sludge sites was considerably lower. This study indicates the high potential value of an anthropogenic process to foraging bats, particularly in a landscape where their insect prey has undergone a marked decline, and suggests that the current preference for activated sludge systems is likely to reduce the value of treatment works as foraging sites for bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Antibiotic-producing Streptomyces bacteria are ubiquitous in nature, yet most studies of its diversity have focused on free-living strains inhabiting diverse soil environments and those in symbiotic relationship with invertebrates.\nResults: We studied the draft genomes of 73 Streptomyces isolates sampled from the skin (wing and tail membranes) and fur surfaces of bats collected in Arizona and New Mexico. We uncovered large genomic variation and biosynthetic potential, even among closely related strains. The isolates, which were initially identified as three distinct species based on sequence variation in the 16S rRNA locus, could be distinguished as 41 different species based on genome-wide average nucleotide identity. Of the 32 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) classes detected, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, siderophores, and terpenes were present in all genomes. On average, Streptomyces genomes carried 14 distinct classes of BGCs (range = 9–20). Results also revealed large inter- and intra-species variation in gene content (single nucleotide polymorphisms, accessory genes and singletons) and BGCs, further contributing to the overall genetic diversity present in bat-associated Streptomyces. Finally, we show that genome-wide recombination has partly contributed to the large genomic variation among strains of the same species.\nConclusions: Our study provides an initial genomic assessment of bat-associated Streptomyces that will be critical to prioritizing those strains with the greatest ability to produce novel antibiotics. It also highlights the need to recognize within-species variation as an important factor in genetic manipulation studies, diversity estimates and drug discovery efforts in Streptomyces.",

We found that both species were patchily distributed and that Northern Long-eared Bats were more widely distributed across the island than previously documented. We located and characterized 36 roost trees from 14 female (6 lactating and 8 non-lactating) Northern Long-eared bats and found that, relative to conspeci¿c populations on mainland North America, female Northern Long-eared Bats on the northern peninsula of Newfoundland roosted in shorter trees with smaller diameters. We also found that roosts used by lactating Northern Long-eared females were in cavities of large-diameter trees that maintained more stable microclimates compared to roosts used by non-lactating females.",

            "abstractNote": "Since the elimination of dog and terrestrial wild animal rabies, bat exposures remain the only source of autochthonous lyssavirus transmission to humans in Western Europe. European bats have already been found infected with several lyssaviruses, and human–bat interactions represent a risk of viral transmission and fatal encephalitis for humans. In this study, we aim to better characterize exposures to bats in metropolitan France from 2003 to 2016 and to identify circumstances associated with exposures to lyssavirus-positive bats. Two complementary sources of data were analysed: 1/ data associated with bats responsible for human exposure received for Lyssavirus testing by the French National Reference Centre for Rabies (NRCR); and 2/ data pertaining to individuals seeking medical care through the French Anti-Rabies Clinics network after contact with a bat. From 2003 to 2016, 425 bats originating from metropolitan France were submitted to the NRCR and 16 (4%) were found positive with a lyssavirus (EBLV-1b was diagnosed in 9 bats, EBLV-1a in 6 and BBLV in one specimen). The two factors associated with bat positivity in our study were the female sex and the bat belonging to the E. serotinus species. During the same study period, 1718 individuals sought care at an Anti-Rabies Clinic after exposure to a bat resulting in an estimated incidence of human–bat interactions of 1.96 per 106 person-years. The two most frequent circumstances of exposure were handling or bites. Interactions mostly involved one adult human being and one live and nonsick-looking bat. Our study provides new insights about circumstances of human–bat interactions and may be helpful to target prevention interventions to improve the awareness of the population of the risk of lyssavirus transmission.",
