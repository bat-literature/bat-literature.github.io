The North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) aims to use its technology infrastructure to assess status and trends of bat populations, while developing innovative and community‐driven conservation solutions.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Here, we present\n                    NABat ML\n                    , an automated machine‐learning algorithm that improves the scalability and scientific transparency of NABat acoustic monitoring. This model combines signal processing techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify recorded bat echolocation calls. We developed our CNN model with internet‐based computing resources (‘cloud environment’), and trained it on >600,000 spectrogram images. We also incorporated species range maps to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model for future ‘unseen’ data. We evaluated model performance using a comprehensive, independent, holdout dataset.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    NABat ML\n                    successfully distinguished 31 classes (30 species and a noise class) with overall weighted‐average accuracy and precision rates of 92%, and ≥90% classification accuracy for 19 of the bat species. Using a single cloud‐environment computing instance, the entire model training process took <16 h.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Our convolutional neural network (CNN)‐based model,\n                    NABat ML\n                    , classifies 30 North American bat species using their recorded echolocation calls with an overall accuracy of 92%. In addition to providing highly accurate species‐level classification,\n                    NABat ML\n                    and its outputs are compatible with Bayesian and other statistical techniques for measuring uncertainty in classification. Our model is open‐source and reproducible, enabling future implementations as software on end‐user devices and cloud‐based web applications. These qualities make\n                    NABat ML\n                    highly suitable for applications ranging from grassroots community science initiatives to big‐data methods developed and implemented by researchers and professional practitioners. We believe the transparency and accessibility of\n                    NABat ML\n                    will encourage broad‐scale participation in bat monitoring, and enable development of innovative solutions needed to conserve North American bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Behavioural plasticity is a critical component of natural selection leading to evolution. However, a surge of studies in the last two decades has discovered a distinct limit to behavioural plasticity, commonly referred to as behaviour types and behavioural syndromes. We set out to understand the relationships across behavioural categories in wild-caught adult, female big brown bats and how they compare between social and solitary behaviours. Using bats sampled from four different maternity colonies, we ran a series of behavioural assays to create a behavioural proﬁle for each individual. The behavioural proﬁle encompassed exploratory, learning, competitive and aggressive categories. We found that Big brown bats exhibit a mean proﬁle relatively unique to other well-documented species, where aggression was linked to increased competitive ability but not to boldness. Our results indicate that the solitary and socially directed behaviours of individuals are not necessarily related and that behaviours pertaining to social interactions are linked most closely to learning abilities. Furthermore, we found evidence that poor body condition may be a predictor of increased social interactions and that behaviours exhibited in the presence of conspeciﬁcs are unrelated to those exhibited in solitude. These ﬁndings indicate importance of social afﬁliations on individual behaviours in this species and their uniqueness relative to other well-studied taxa.",

Although preferential associations have been documented in multiple species, this phenomenon has never been empirically studied in bats—the second largest order of mammals, where many of the 1200+ species live in groups of tens to hundreds of individuals. Given the current understanding of the social behaviour exhibited in this species, we explored the possibility that adult female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus (Beauvois, 1796)) show preferential association between group-mates using a pairwise choice design with individuals from a captive colony. Focal individuals were placed in a Y-maze and were given free choice of two familiar conspeciﬁcs. We measured the time focal individuals spent in close proximity to each conspeciﬁc. Our results indicate that some bats exhibit preferential association between group-mates, as multiple individuals spent signiﬁcantly more time in close proximity to one conspeciﬁc versus another, despite randomizing the position of stimulus bats between trials. Given the frequent and long-term associations between group members of this species, social preferences could play a signiﬁcant role in the outcomes of their long-term ﬁtness.",

One case is still under treatment with pimobendan alone, following diagnosis before onset of clinical signs. Diuretic treatment consisted of furosemide at a dose rate of 0.5–5 mg/kg, one to three times daily, and, or spironolactone at a dose rate of 1–4 mg/kg, once or twice daily. When used, the ACEI imidapril was given at a dose rate of 0.24–0.38 mg/kg q 24 hr, and pimobendan at a dose rate of 0.2–0.5 mg/kg bid.

It differs from the nominate Philippine subspecies in having large white tufts on the sides of the neck and a relatively shorter, higher rostrum. Further specimens of Chironax melanocephalus from Borneo confirm the allocation of this population to the nominate subspecies. Observations of live Rousettus spinalatus show that the wings are joined over the middle of the back, and suggest that this species echolocates in a similar fashion to Rousettus amplexicaudatus.",

Our observation corroborates earlier evidence that bats and Common Nighthawks both exploit the foraging opportunity created by artificial lights. Because the monument provided spatial perspective, we were also able to observe that bats and Common Nighthawks foraged at different heights, suggesting that they partitioned the available foraging space vertically.",

The capacity to survive infections\n of highly pathogenic agents without severe disease, together with many other unique features, makes bats an ideal animal model for studying the regulation of infection, cancer, and longevity, which is likely to translate into human health outcomes. A key factor that limits bat research is\n lack of breeding bat colonies. To address this need, a captive bat colony was established in Singapore from 19 wild-caught local cave nectar bats. The bats were screened for specific pathogens before the start of captive breeding. Custom-made cages and an optimized diet inclusive of Wombaroo\n dietary formula, liquid diet, and supplement of fruits enabled the bats to breed prolifically in our facility. Cages are washed daily and disinfected once every fortnight. Bats are observed daily to detect any sick bat or abnormal behavior. In addition, bats undergo a thorough health check\n once every 3 to 4 mo to check on their overall wellbeing, perform sampling, and document any potential pregnancy. The current colony houses over 80 bats that are successfully breeding, providing a valuable resource for research in Singapore and overseas.",

            "abstractNote": "Two common bat lyssavirus species have been identiﬁed in many European countries: European bat lyssavirus type-1 and -2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2). Only limited knowledge on the susceptibility of the natural EBLV-hosts, insectivorous bats, to lyssavirus infection is available. Our study was undertaken to evaluate the susceptibility and pathology associated with an EBLV-1 infection in Eptesicus fuscus following different routes of virus inoculation including intracranial (n = 6), intramuscular (n = 14), oral (n = 7) and intranasal (n = 7). Blood and saliva samples were collected from all bats on a monthly basis. Four bats inoculated intracranially developed rabies with a mean of 11 days to death, whilst seven bats inoculated intramuscularly developed rabies, with an extended incubation period prior to death. We did not observe any mortality in the oral (p.o.) or intranasal (i.n.) groups and both groups had detectable levels of virus neutralizing antibodies (data not shown). Virus shedding was demonstrated in the saliva by virus isolation and the detection of viral RNA in ill bats, particularly immediately prior to the development of disease. In addition, the presence of virus and viral RNA was detected in the thyroid gland in bats challenged experimentally with EBLV-1, which exceeded that detected in all other extraneural tissue. The signiﬁcance of detecting EBLV-1 in the thyroid gland of rabid bats is not well understood. We speculate that the infection of the thyroid gland may cause subacute thyroiditis, a transient form of thyroiditis causing hyperthyroidism, resulting in changes in adrenocortical activity that could lead to hormonal dysfunction, thereby distinguishing the clinical presentation of rabies in the rabid host.",

Aerial feeders have small hind feet, short calcars, short ears, and narrow tragi. Gleaners have small hind feet, long ears, and wide tragi and tend to be larger in body size. Bats that feed over water have large hind feet, short calcars, short ears, and narrow tragi and tend to be smaller in body size. Trawlers have large hind feet and long calcars and tend to be larger in body size. The morphometric analysis also confirmed that some species of Myotis were intermediate in morphological features, coinciding with alternation between foraging styles. The results support the view that the morphological features previously used to assign Myotis species to subgenera are more functional than phylogenetic, a position supported by recent genetic analyses. Examination of foraging styles from a phylogenetic perspective suggests that aerial feeding is ancestral and that subsequent diversification has been associated with partitioning and specialization into either gleaning or foraging over water and trawling. When the predictions from the multivariate analysis of the data for the genus Myotis are used with data from other bats, they suggest that 5 species of Nycteris are gleaners, while 11 species of Eptesicus are either aerial feeders or feed over water.",

In the neotropical fringe-lipped bat,\n              Trachops cirrhosus\n              , social transmission of foraging behaviour is clearly demonstrated in captivity, yet its social structure in the wild remains unclear. Here, we used microsatellite-based estimates of relatedness and records of 157 individually marked adults from 106 roost captures over 6 years, to infer whether male and female\n              T. cirrhosus\n              have preferred co-roosting associations and whether such associations were influenced by relatedness. Using a null model that controlled for year and roosting location, we found that both male and female\n              T. cirrhosus\n              have preferred roosting partners, but that only females demonstrate kin-biased association. Most roosting groups (67%) contained multiple females with one or two reproductive males. Relatedness patterns and recapture records corroborate genetic evidence for female philopatry and male dispersal. Our study adds to growing evidence that many bats demonstrate preferred roosting associations, which has the potential to influence social information transfer.",

Multiple analyses of call features, including duration (ms), lowest frequency (kHz), highest frequency (kHz) and frequency with most energy (kHz), indicated signiﬁcant inter-individual variation. Discriminant function analysis of call features correctly classiﬁed the calls of individuals from four roosts > 70% on 19 of 28 times. Although other species of molossids (Chaerephon pumilus, Tadarida aegyptiaca, and one unidentiﬁed species) produced social calls as well as frequency-modulated sweep calls, O. martiensseni produced just the latter vocalizations and they were longer and lower in frequency than those of the sympatric molossids. Other species of molossids, but not O. martiensseni, produced feeding buzzes as they attacked ﬂying insects. The frequency-modulated sweep calls of O. martiensseni seem to serve a communication function, but they may not be used in echolocation unlike similar calls by other molossids. Individually distinct communication signals (frequency-modulated sweep calls) enhance communication in a species that lives in year-round social groups (one adult male, females and dependent young).",

This is unfortunate because the use of markers with contrasting modes of inheritance and rates of evolution might provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of a species’ history. Here we present a detailed study of the phylogeography of the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, using 1098 bp of the mitochondrial ND2 gene from 45 localities from across its Palaearctic range to infer population history. In addition, we re-analysed a large microsatellite data set available for this species and compared the results of both markers to infer population relationships and the historical processes influencing them. We show that mtDNA, the most popular marker in phylogeography studies, yielded a misleading result, and would have led us to conclude erroneously that a single expansion had taken place in Europe. Only by combining the mitochondrial and microsatellite data sets are we able to reconstruct the species’ history and show two colonization events in Europe, one before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and one after it. Combining markers also revealed the importance of Asia Minor as an ancient refugium for this species and a source population for the expansion of the greater horseshoe bat into Europe before the LGM.",

We recorded auditory receptor cell action potentials elicited in underwing moths (Catocala spp.) by echolocation calls emitted during gleaning attacks by Myotis septentrionalis (the northern long-eared bat) and during ﬂights by the aerial hawker Myotis lucifugus (the little brown bat). The moth ear responds inconsistently and with fewer action potentials to the echolocation calls emitted by the gleaner, a situation that worsened when the moth’s ear was covered by its wing (mimicking a moth resting on a surface). Calls emitted by the aerial-hawking bat elicited a signiﬁcantly stronger spiking response from the moth ear. Moths with their ears covered by their wings maintained their relative hearing sensitivity at their best frequency range, the range used by most aerial insectivorous bats, but showed a pronounced deafness in the frequency range typically employed by gleaning bats. Our results (1) support the prediction that the echolocation calls of gleaners are acoustically inconspicuous to the ears of moths (and presumably other nocturnal tympanate insects), leaving the moths particularly vulnerable to predation, and (2) suggest that gleaners gain a foraging advantage against eared prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Echolocating bats are exposed not only to the echoes of their own calls, but often the signals of conspecifics and other bats. For species emitting short, frequency modulated signals (e.g. vespertilionoids), adjustments in both the frequency and time domain have been observed in such situations. However, bats using long duration, constant frequency calls may confront special challenges, since these bats should be less able to avoid temporal and frequency overlap. Here we investigated echolocation call design in the high-duty cycle bat, Rhinolophus capensis, as bats flew with either a conspecific or heterospecific in a large outdoor flight-room. We compared these recordings to those made of bats flying alone in the same flight-room, and in a smaller flight room, alone, and hunting tethered moths. We found no differences in duty cycle or peak frequency of the calls of R. capensis across conditions. However, in the presence of a conspecific or the vespertilionoid, Miniopterus natalensis, R. capensis produced longer frequency-modulated downward sweeps at the terminus of their calls with lower minimum frequencies than when flying alone. In the presence of the larger high-duty cycle bat, R. clivosus, R. capensis produced shorter calls than when flying alone or with a conspecific. These changes are similar to those of vespertilionoids when flying from open to more cluttered environments. They are not similar to those differences observed in vespertilionoids when flying with other bats. Also unlike vespertilinoids, R. capensis used calls 15 dB less intense in conspecific pairs than when alone.",

Prior to the discovery of the bats in 1987, the house was broken into regularly and disturbance levels were quite high. Upon discovery of the roost, the house was fortified and vandalism was greatly reduced. The number of females and the number of volant young greatly increased during our study and was directly correlated with the decline in vandalism. Bats emerged from the house 43.6 (± 10.9 SD) min after local sunset. Bats emerged later in the evening during spring and fall, when it was warmer, and when it was windier. We also evaluated duration of emergence (47.11 [45.0–49.7] min), and seasonal patterns of re-entry into the roost. Several factors suggested that potential predation, most likely by owls, influenced both the timing and duration of evening emergences.",

However, little is known concerning how intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect animal daily rhythms in the field, especially in nocturnal animals. Here, we investigated the first emergence, mid-­emergence, and return times of Vespertilio sinensis, and also integrated environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) and biotic factors (reproductive status and predation risk) to determine causes of variation in the activity rhythms of the bats. We found that variation in the first emergence time, the mid-­emergence time, and the final return time were distinct. The results demonstrated that the emergence and return times of bats were affected by light intensity, reproductive status, and predation risk in a relatively complex pattern. Light intensity had the greatest contribution to activity rhythms. Moreover, we first investigated the effects of actual predators on the activity rhythms of bats; the results showed that the mid-­emergence time of bats was earlier as predators were hunting, but the final return time was later when predators were present. Finally, our results also highlighted the importance of higher energy demands during the lactation in bats to variation in activity rhythms. These results improve our understanding of the patterns and causes of variation in activity rhythms in bats and other nocturnal animals.",

The comparison of DNA sequence motifs, organization and kinetocore components from yeast to man is beginning to indicate that, although centromeres are highly variable DNA elements, a conserved pattern of sequence arrangement and function is emerging. We have identiﬁed and characterized the ﬁrst satellite DNA (P.k.SAT) from microbat species Pipistrellus kuhli. The presence of mammalian CENP-B box and yeast CDEIII box could indicate the participation of P.k.SAT in centromere organization.",

In the dry season, males show simultaneous testis regression and sperm storage in cauda epididymis, enabling them to mate during this season. In this study, we investigated seasonal variations in body mass, diameter and height of seminiferous tubules and nuclei of Leydig cells in a population of southeastern Brazil. We also determined the frequencies of the stages of the seminiferous epithelium cycle (SEC) of mature individuals of this population. Body mass and diameter of Leydig cell nuclei showed no signiﬁcant differences between dry and rainy seasons and stages of annual reproductive cycle; however, all other morphometric parameters varied signiﬁcantly. The relative cumulative frequency of pre-meiotic stages of the SEC (1–3) was 51%, of meiotic stage (4) was 2% and of post-meiotic stages (5–8) was 47%. We conﬁrmed that the yellowish myotis presents seasonal sperm production as revealed by testis regression and epididymal sperm storage during the dry season.",

The colony was monitored each month from November 2014 to December 2015 with 154 males and 117 females captured. Testicular and ovarian histological data from 31 adult males and 22 adult females were obtained. Body condition index of male and female, and gonadosomatic index, epididymis-somatic index and Sertoli cell efficiency were analyzed. Females with spermatozoa in uterine crypts, embryos in oviducts, gravid uteri, and pregnant females were registered during the rainy season (November–March) and into the beginning of the following dry season (April), indicating asynchrony of births. The ovaries showed all types of ovarian follicles, and a polarized ovary cortex was found, differing from the organization pattern of most mammals. The testes showed continuous spermatic activity, but testicular parameters analyzed showed significantly higher values during the rainy season. A shorter mating period during the beginning of this season was detected, when values of the gonadosomatic and epididymis-somatic indexes, and Sertoli cell efficiency showed more pronounced differences in relation to the remaining period of study. Unlike polyestry known for some Neotropical phyllostomids, the reproductive cycle of A. geoffroyi was characterized as seasonal monoestrous, with the main reproductive events occurring during the rainy season, as the best time for females to reproduce, but with offspring recruitment occurring predominantly during the dry season, a period with fewer food resources.",

            "abstractNote": "The use of alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) is widespread in animals. Males of some species may change tactics depending on age, body condition and social environment. Many bat species are polygynous where a fraction of males only have access to fertile females. For polygynous bats, knowledge of the reproductive success of males using different ARTs is scarce, and it remains unclear how age of males is related to switching decisions between social statuses. We studied a large captive population of Carollia perspicillata, where males are either harem holders, bachelors or peripheral males. Using a multistate procedure, we modelled the age-related switches in reproductive tactics and in survival probability. From the model, we calculated the reproductive success and the frequencies of males displaying different reproductive tactics. As in mammals, the switch between social statuses is often related to age, we predicted that the transition probability of bachelor and peripheral males to harem status would increase with age. We show, however, that social status transition towards a harem holding position was not related to age. Reproductive success changed with age and social status. Harem males had a signiﬁcantly higher reproductive success than bachelor males except between a short period from 3.8 to 4.4 years of age where success was similar, and a signiﬁcantly higher reproductive success than peripheral males between 2.6 and 4.4 years of age. Harem males showed a clear decrease in the probability of maintaining social status with age, which suggests that senescence reduces resource holding potential.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats of the genus Sturnira (Family Phyllostomidae) are characterised by shoulder glands that are more developed in reproductively mature adult males. The glands produce a waxy secretion that accumulates on the fur around the gland, dyeing the fur a dark colour and giving off a pungent odour. These shoulder glands are thought to play a role in their reproductive behaviour. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, we analysed solvent extracts of fur surrounding the shoulder gland in the northern-shouldered bat, Sturnira parvidens to (i) characterise the chemical composition of shoulder gland secretions for the ﬁrst time, and (ii) look for differences in chemical composition among and between adult males, sub-adult/juvenile males and adult females. Fur solvent extracts were analysed as liquids and also further extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction to identify volatile components in the odour itself. Odour ﬁngerprint analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling plots and multivariate analysis revealed clear and signiﬁcant differences (P < 0.001) between adult males vs both juvenile males and adult females. The chemical components of the shoulder gland secretion included terpenes and phenolics, together with alcohols and esters, most likely derived from the frugivorous diet of the bat. Many of the compounds identiﬁed were found exclusively or in elevated quantities among adult (reproductive) males compared with adult females and non-reproductive (juvenile) males. This strongly suggests a speciﬁc role in male–female attraction although a function in male–male competition and/or species recognition is also possible.",

Current lack of knowledge about the roosting ecology of these species in boreal forest limits our understanding of how they may be affected by logging. The main objective was to identify tree and forest stand features that were selected by bats for roosting within a balsam ﬁr (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) – paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall) forest of Quebec, Canada. Over 3 years, we captured and ﬁtted radio transmitters to 22 individual bats to locate their roost trees for 7–14 days following release. We measured tree and forest stand features in the ﬁeld and using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology. Roost trees were compared with random trees using generalized linear mixed models. Male Myotis bats selected larger and taller snags, within stands containing a higher proportion of canopy gaps and a larger number of snags compared with random trees. Vegetation clumps of 0.1 ha containing a minimum of 10 snags with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm should be maintained to preserve roosting habitat that is used by male Myotis bats in balsam ﬁr – paper birch forests.",

Additional information on the species, particularly its summer roosting ecology, is needed to inform appropriate management and conservation planning. While conducting a summer survey of multiple bat species using buildings as roosts in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, we discovered Eastern Small-footed Myotis roosting in 3 historic buildings on the northwest slope of Mount LeConte. At least 1 building contained a maternity colony. Humans used all 3 buildings on a daily basis.",

These species is included in the IUCN Red List list with Least Concern (LC) status or at the least information. This study was to describe of R. microphyllum as a new record in the southern of Lombok, and to examine the parasites and microbes that infest it. The study was carried out in the developed ecotourism area of southern Lombok Island of NTB during February-April 2017. A modified net and quadrant for cave ceiling was used to collect bat sample. Ectoparasite collection was done by combing the bat's hair and the falling specimens were collected. The endoparasite examination was done by the flotation methods of intestinal contents, while microbial examination was done by collecting the microbes from oral cavity and feces. The results showed the discovery of R. microphyllum in two ecotourism development sites, The Buwun Cave and The Gale Gale Bangkang Cave Prabu Village, Central Lombok. The endoparasit examination found 4 species of endoparasit, 1 species of Coccidia sp, 2 species of Trematodes from Lecithodendridae Family (Prosthodendrium sp and Acanthatrium sp) and 1 unidentified Nematode specimen. The ectoparasite examination found only 1 species, Ischnopsyllus hexactenus (The long Eared Bat Flea), and the microbes found from oral cavity analysis are the Gram positive Coccus (Stphylococcus aureus) and faecal analysis are the Coccobacil Gram negative (Providensia penneri).",

This behavior can be of public health concern where bats that may carry diseases (e.g., rabies) move among buildings occupied by people. We used passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) to mark individual bats and hoop PIT readers at emergence points to passively monitor the use of building roosts by marked adult females on a daily basis during the lactation phase of reproduction. Multi-strata models were used to examine movements among roosts in relation to ambient temperatures and ectoparasite loads. Our results suggest that high ambient temperatures inﬂuence movements. Numbers of mites (Steatonyssus occidentalis) did not appear to inﬂuence movements of female bats among building roosts. In an urban landscape, periods with unusually hot conditions are accompanied by shifting of bats to different buildings or segments of buildings, and this behavior may increase the potential for contact with people in settings where, in comparison to their more regularly used buildings, the bats may be more likely to be of public concern as nuisances or health risks.",

At birth young were altricial. By day five, their eyes had opened, and the pinnae become unfolded between sixth and ninth day of age. At the age of three days, the mean forearm length and body mass were equivalent to 42.2% and 18.2%, respectively of the values of postpartum females. The length of forearm increased linearly until 36 days and attained 94.1% of mean forearm length of postpartum females at the age of 219 days. Body mass of pups increased linearly until 60 days and attained 72.7% of mean mass of postpartum females at the age of 219 days. The length of total epiphyseal gap of fourth metacarpal-phalangeal joint increased until 15 days of age and subsequently decreased linearly, and closed at about 60 days of age. The age predicting equation based on the length of forearm is valid when its dimensions are between 29.4 mm and 52.4 mm (3–36 days of age). Similar equation but based on the length of total epiphyseal gap is valid when its dimensions range from 47.0 μm to 6.0 μm (15–60 days of age). Growth patterns of forearm length and body mass were best described by the logistic and Gompertz nonlinear growth models, respectively. There was no significant difference in the growth patterns of body mass and length of total epiphyseal gap with reference to lengths of forearm of captive and wild-grown pups.",

            "abstractNote": "The emergence of the disease chytridiomycosis caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been implicated in dramatic global amphibian declines. While many species have undergone catastrophic declines and/or extinctions, others appear to be unaffected or persist at reduced frequencies after Bd outbreaks. The reasons behind this variance in disease outcomes are poorly understood: differences in host immune responses have been proposed, yet previous studies suggest a lack of robust immune responses to Bd in susceptible species. Here, we sequenced transcriptomes from clutch-mates of a highly susceptible amphibian, Atelopus zeteki, with different infection histories. We found significant changes in expression of numerous genes involved in innate and inflammatory responses in infected frogs, despite high susceptibility to chytridiomycosis. We show evidence of acquired immune responses generated against Bd, including increased expression of immunoglobulins and MHC genes. In addition, fungal-killing genes had significantly higher expression in frogs previously exposed to Bd compared to Bd-naïve frogs, including chitinase and serine-type proteases. However, our results appear to confirm recent in vitro evidence of immune suppression by Bd, demonstrated by decreased expression of lymphocyte genes in the spleen of infected compared to control frogs. We propose susceptibility to chytridiomycosis is not due to lack of Bd-specific immune responses, but instead is caused by failure of those responses to be effective. Ineffective immune pathway activation and timing of antibody production are discussed as potential mechanisms. However, in light of our findings, suppression of key immune responses by Bd is likely an important factor in the lethality of this fungus.",

We studied whether the location of and landscape structure around nine nursery roosts and seven male-only roosts differed during the nursery period (15 May-31 July). Roosts were located by radio-tracking, and animal numbers and group composition were obtained by trapping and counting at roosts. Landscape structure was evaluated by a GIS-based habitat analysis. 2. Marked variation in animal numbers was observed both in nursery roosts (range: 6–144 individuals) and male roosts (range: 1–51 individuals). The surroundings of nursery and male roosts varied signiﬁcantly in the proportion of areas belonging to different landscape elements. The areas covered by ponds, lakes and rivers, as well as the area covered by coppices were larger in the surroundings of nursery roosts. Moreover, nursery roosts lay closer to a river and at lower altitudes than male roosts. Male Daubenton’s bats used more distant foraging sites than gravid or lactating females. 3. The differences in roost-site location between the two sexes are suggestive of intraspeciﬁc competition for access to productive foraging areas in the surroundings of the summer roosts, with females being dominant over males. We assume that breeding females defend climatically favourable areas with good food supply in order to increase the survival of their offspring.",

Cytogenetically, both species differ from other <i>Scotophilus</i> species in the subtelocentric morphology of chromosome 2 and a terminal heterochromatic segment on the X chromosome. Further, <i>Scotophilus</i> sp. nov. is characterized by a subtelocentric chromosome 4 not found in any other <i>Scotophilus</i> species. Comparing the <i>Scotophilus</i> karyotype with that of the vespertilionid genus <i>Myotis</i>, extensive conservation of whole chromosome arms has been found recently. However, out of 25 chromosomal arms six could not be identified in <i>Scotophilus</i>. Therefore, in the present study fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome painting probes from <i>Myotis myotis</i> was carried out on metaphase preparations from <i>Scotophilus dinganii</i> and <i>Scotophilus </i>sp. nov. These experiments revealed that three previously unidentified <i>Scotophilus</i> chromosomes (A, B, C) contain homologous sequences to <i>Myotis</i> chromosomes 18 plus 22, 19 plus 25, and 16/17, respectively.",

Franquet’s fruit bat (Epomops franqueti) is host to several parasites such as protozoa, bacteria, viruses and mites. Yet, studies exploring the values of its blood components with interest for research or food purposes are scarce. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate the hematological values of the adult E. franqueti.\nMethods: Seventeen (nine female and eight male) apparently healthy adult E. franqueti were captured from their roosting colony. Blood samples were collected for determination of erythrocyte indices [red blood cell count (RBC), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)] and leukocyte indices [total white blood cell counts (WBC), lymphocytes, eosinophil, monocytes, neutrophil count and erythrocytes osmotic fragility].\nResults: There were no significant (p ≥ 0.05) sex-related differences in RBC, PCV, Hb concentration, MCV, MCH, MCHC and total and differential WBC of E. franqueti. Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was significantly higher in female than in male E. franqueti at 0.1% NaCl.\nConclusions: These considerations are critical in establishing reference ranges of blood parameters for E. franqueti and may provide insight to why they serve as reservoir hosts for several microorganisms.",

The bats can detect and attack rapidly moving targets within the clutter, i.e. below grass panicles, by using prey motion as a cue. Stationary objects are attacked only above the grass, but still within the clutter overlap zone. To test if the bats were guided by flutter from moth wings or by vision when searching for stationary targets, they were presented with male ghost swifts mounted on top of steel wires. There was no difference in attack frequency on live, fluttering moths compared to dead and spread ones. However, when comparing white and dark moths, we found a significantly higher attack frequency on white ones. As the attacks always were guided by echolocation calls, we hypothesize that northern bats, at least in the initial search phase, use visual cues as a complement to detect stationary ghost swifts.",

Predation is typically understood to mean “capture, kill, and eat”. However, none of these aspects had been observed. Moreover, key aspects of bat biology were not taken into account, including that the bat in question was a ﬂightless newborn, the capture of which would require some explanation. We revisit this interesting observation considering both bat and spider ecology.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are ancient hosts of Trypanosoma species and their flying ability, longevity and adaptability to distinct environments indicate that they are efficient dispersers of parasites. Bats from Acre state (Amazon Biome) were collected in four expeditions conducted in an urban forest (Parque Zoobotânico) and one relatively more preserved area (Seringal Cahoeira) in Rio Branco and Xapuri municipalities. Trypanosoma sp. infection was detected by hemoculture and fresh blood examination. Isolated parasite species were identified by the similarity of the obtained DNA sequence from 18S rDNA polymerase chain reaction and reference strains. Overall, 367 bats from 23 genera and 32 species were examined. Chiropterofauna composition was specific to each municipality, although Artibeus sp. and Carollia sp. prevailed throughout. Trypanosoma sp. infection was detected in 85 bats (23·2%). The most widely distributed and prevalent genotypes were (in order) Trypanosoma cruzi TcI, T. cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma dionisii, T. cruzi TcIV and Trypanosoma rangeli. At least one still-undescribed Trypanosoma species was also detected in this study. The detection of T. cruzi TcI and TcIV (the ones associated with Chagas disease in Amazon biome) demonstrates the putative importance of these mammal hosts in the epidemiology of the disease in the Acre State.",

Here, we report seasonal, daily and inter-individual variation in three communicative behaviors engaged in by male bats. The frequency of male behaviors identified as scent-marking, vigorous wing-flapping and the making of an openwing gesture were found to vary seasonally, depending on the reproductive status of conspecific females in the study colony. The duration of scent-marking was markedly high during mating seasons, in comparison with wing-flapping and wing-gesturing. In mating seasons, the pattern to the daily variation in behavior correlated strongly with the gender of the responder present in the diurnal roost and/or colony. For instance, scent-marking and vigorous wing-flapping were more frequent during late-evening and early-morning hours, mostly when females were absent from the day roost, while male-male encounters were possible. In contrast, wing-gesturing was more frequent during morning and early-evening hours, when females were present in the day roost. The results from our study suggest that male scent-marking and wing-flapping are directed towards competitor males in the colony, with a view to resource-defense behavior being manifested. Furthermore, male wing-gesturing is predicted to be directed towards co-roosting females, with the aim in this case being for some form of social information to be communicated, particularly during the mating season. However, marginal inter-individual variation in the frequency of occurrence of behaviors between seasons was apparent, suggesting that these communicative behaviors could be tied to male-male competition in this species.",

Body mass and forearm length of pups increased monotonically until 20 days, when they achieved 72.37% and 91.70% of the values of postpartum females and thereafter growth rates decreased. Epiphyseal gap length increased to its maximum size at about 8–10 days after birth and subsequently decreased. Wing ­characteristics including wingspan, wing area, handwing length, handwing area, armwing length, and armwing area increased monotonically until the age of the first flight, after which growth rates significantly declined (all P < 0.05). Pups achieved sustained flight at 25–30 days of age. Wing loading of pups was 11.28 ± 1.27 Nm–2 and decreased monotonically to 5.99 ± 0.68 Nm–2, but aspect ratio remained fairly constant. Regression analysis indicates that handwing length and forearm length provide the most accurate estimate age of the young of My. emarginatus.",

This data set consisted of an X-linked nuclear intron (Bgn; 543 bp), mitochondrial DNA (cytb-tRNA-control region; 1630 bp) and eight variable microsatellite loci for up to 373 individuals from 86 localities. Using this data set of diverse markers, it was possible to determine the species’ demography at three temporal stages. Nuclear intron data revealed early colonization into Europe from the east, which pre-dates the Quaternary glaciations. The mtDNA data supported multiple glacial refugia across the Mediterranean, the largest of which were found in the IberoMaghreb region and an eastern location (Anatolia/Middle East)–that were used by R. hipposideros during the most recent glacial cycles. Finally, microsatellites provided the most recent information on these species’ movements since the Last Glacial Maximum and suggested that lineages that had diverged into glacial refugia, such as in the Ibero-Maghreb region, have remained isolated. These ﬁndings should be used to inform future conservation management strategies for R. hipposideros and show the power of using a multimarker data set for phylogeographic studies.",

However, increased human safety concerns have led to accelerated abandoned mine closure programs. To protect roosting sites in mines with significant bat activity, bat-compatible gates are installed that allow continued access to mine workings. Aside from ensuring public safety, these gates provide protection from disturbance to roosting bats. We evaluated the effects of gating on bat flight behavior at maternity colonies in 2 previously gated (control) and 2 ungated (treatment) mines that were gated during this study. We used an infrared video camera to record bat flight behavior at the entrances to each of the 4 study mines for 2 consecutive mornings and a single night each month during the warm season. Entrance (03:00–06:00) and emergence (21:00–24:00) surveys comprised 3 consecutive hours. Overall circling activity increased more than 6-fold at openings of treatment mines following gating (P < 0.001). Crowding during emergence was significantly higher (P = 0.023) in newly gated mines than in previously gated mines. Gates affect subadults during the initial-volancy periods, as detected through collisions with the gates. Increased activity of bats and collisions with the gate, which result in bats falling to the ground at mine openings, may amplify vulnerability to predators and increase energetic demands.",

            "abstractNote": "The presence of bats in caves, attics, ceilings, and roofs is important epidemiologically as they can increase the chance of human acquisition of pathogens, including Histoplasma capsulatum. Brazilian urban areas contain many species of bats, especially insectivorous bats, that are attracted by a wide range of readily available food and shelter. From August 2003 to December 2008, we analysed 2427 bats in the Sa˜ o Paulo State region. Homogenates of the livers and spleens of the bats were plated on speciﬁc medium to identify animals infected with H. capsulatum. The fungus was isolated from 87 bats (3.6%). The infected bats were identiﬁed as Molossus molossus (74), Nyctinomops macrotis (10), Tadarida brasiliensis (1), Molossus rufus (1) and Eumops glaucinus (1), all insectivorous species. The data presented are a relevant contribution to the epidemiology of H. capsulatum in densely populated urban areas such as in Sa˜ o Paulo State, especially since histoplasmosis is not included in the mandatory disease notiﬁcation system.",

We also compared the bleeding times of domestic sheep following a single defensive bite from a bat, before and after subjecting the animals to a series of feeding bites by Desmodus. Clotting time was significantly shorter in bat-attacked than in bat-na¨ıve livestock. Bleeding time after a provoked defensive bat bite was significantly shorter after sheep were exposed to a series of feeding bites from Desmodus. Bat predation induced increased resistance by the prey against the anticoagulants, suggesting an immune response.",

            "abstractNote": "Primary and secondary poisoning of nontarget wildlife with second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides has led to restrictions on their use and to increased use of firstgeneration anticoagulants, including diphacinone. Although first-generation anticoagulants are less potent and less persistent than second-generation compounds, their use is not without risks to nontarget species. We report the first known mortalities of threatened New Zealand lesser shorttailed bats (Mystacina tuberculata) caused by diphacinone intoxication. The mortalities occurred during a rodent control operation in Pureora Forest Park, New Zealand, during the 2008–2009 Austral summer. We observed 115 lesser short-tailed bat deaths between 9 January and 6 February 2009, and it is likely that many deaths were undetected. At necropsy, adult bats showed gross and histologic hemorrhages consistent with coagulopathy, and diphacinone residues were confirmed in 10 of 12 liver samples tested. The cause of mortality of pups was diagnosed as a combination of the effects of diphacinone toxicity, exposure, and starvation. Diphacinone was also detected in two of 11 milk samples extracted from the stomachs of dead pups. Eight adults and 20 pups were moribund when found. Two adults and five pups survived to admission to a veterinary hospital. Three pups responded to treatment and were released at the roost site on 17 March, 2009. The route of diphacinone ingestion by adult bats is uncertain. Direct consumption of toxic bait or consumption of poisoned arthropod prey could have occurred. We suggest that the omnivorous diet and terrestrial feeding habits of lesser short-tailed bats make them susceptible to poisoning with the bait matrix and the method of bait delivery used. We recommend the use of alternative vertebrate pesticides, bait matrices, and delivery methods in bat habitat.",

It is mostly mechanically transmitted by tabanids and stomoxes, initially to camels, in sub-Saharan area. The disease spread from North Africa towards the Middle East, Turkey, India, up to 53° North in Russia, across all South-East Asia, down to Indonesia and the Philippines, and it was also introduced by the conquistadores into Latin America. It can affect a very large range of domestic and wild hosts including camelids, equines, cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs and other carnivores, deer, gazelles, and elephants. It found a new large range of wild and domestic hosts in Latin America, including reservoirs (capybaras) and biological vectors (vampire bats). Surra is a major disease in camels, equines, and dogs, in which it can often be fatal in the absence of treatment, and exhibits nonspecific clinical signs (anaemia, loss of weight, abortion, and death), which are variable from one host and one place to another; however, its immunosuppressive effects interfering with intercurrent diseases or vaccination campaigns might be its most significant and questionable aspect.",

The two subspecies are thought to be geographically separated. Due to their cryptic morphology, this hypothesis has never been tested and can benefit from being examined within a molecular framework. In this study, mitochondrial sequence data from 38 D. intermedius and nuclear sequence data from 14 D. intermedius from across their range were used to test the hypothesis that genetically defined groups correspond geographically with the two morphologically defined subspecies. Although high levels of divergence of the mitochondrial sequence (11.6%) suggest genetically distinct clusters sympatric in southern Texas, no genetic structure was recovered with the nuclear marker. Moreover, the mitochondrial sequence data recovered a paraphyletic relationship between the two subspecies of D. intermedius with the Cuban yellow bat (D. insularis), whereas no such paraphyly was recovered from analysis of the nuclear marker. Divergence time based on analyses of mitochondrial sequence for the two subspecies was approximately 5.5 Ma. The patterns observed are hypothesized to be the result of past isolation of lineages and secondary contact that is currently contributing to gene flow.",

The thalamocortical connections in the pallid bat are organized as parallel pathways that may serve echolocation and prey localization behaviors. Thalamic inputs to the cortical echolocation call‐ and noise‐selective regions originate primarily in the suprageniculate nucleus (SG) and ventral division of medial geniculate body (MGBv), respectively. Here we examined the distribution of parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) expression in cortical regions and thalamic nuclei of these pathways. Electrophysiology was used to identify cortical regions selective for echolocation calls and noise. Immunohistochemistry was used to stain for PV and CB in the auditory cortex and MGB. A higher percentage (relative to Nissl‐stained cells) of PV\n              +\n              cells compared with CB\n              +\n              cells was found in both echolocation call‐ and noise‐selective regions. This was due to differences in cortical layers V–VI, but not layers I–IV. In the MGB, CB\n              +\n              cells were present across all divisions of the MGB, with a higher percentage in the MGBv than the SG. Perhaps the most surprising result was the virtual absence of PV staining in the MGBv. PV staining was present only in the SG. Even in the SG, the staining was mostly diffuse in the neuropil. These data support the notion that calcium binding proteins are differentially distributed in different processing streams. Our comparative data, however, do not support a general mammalian pattern of PV/CB staining that distinguishes lemniscal and nonlemniscal pathways. J. Comp.

Several species of bats have adapted to a variety of food resources and shelters in urban areas. This study aimed to detect Leishmania spp. DNA in bats present in forest fragments located in metropolitan areas endemic for leishmaniasis in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil. Blood samples were obtained from 80 individuals, including eight species of Phyllostomidae and one species of Vespertilionidae. Thirty of the 80 bats were positive for Leishmania spp. using conventional PCR, all belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. Eighteen samples tested by real-time PCR (qPCR) using speciﬁc primers for the kDNA of Leishmania infantum were positive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report detecting Leishmania spp. in Platyrrhinus incarum in addition to being the ﬁrst reported detection of L. infantum in the bat species Phyllostomus discolor, Platyrrhinus lineatus, Artibeus planirostris and Artibeus lituratus. Our results show that bats can host Leishmania spp. in areas endemic for leishmaniasis, which must be taken into account in disease control operations by public health authorities.",

The present study aimed to assess the presence of P. destructans in Northern Belgium, to describe the skin mycobiome of active bats during summer and autumn, and to analyze possible differences in fungal diversity among bat species, sampling sites, and seasons. In total, 114 bat specimens belonging to seven species were sampled from various localities. Culture-based methods revealed an important mycological diversity with 209 different taxa. Overall, a mean of 3.7 taxa per bat was recorded but significant differences were observed between sampling sites and seasons with a higher diversity in autumn as compared to summer. The mycobiomes were dominated by cosmopolitan and plant-associated species, in particular from the genera Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus. Other species known to be related to bats or their environment, like Apiotrichum otae, were also retrieved. Although P. destructans was not detected, the sampling of the hibernacula indicated that they can be inhabited by diverse fungal species including a yet undescribed Pseudogymnoascus species, distinct from P. destructans, namely P. cavicola, sp. nov.",

All cases were found during the day, in different neighborhoods, prostrate and unable to fly. No significant lesions were observed at necropsy or on histologic examination. The brains of the five bats showed strong immunohistochemical labeling for rabies virus in the form of large corpuscles or multiple clusters of granules within the perikarya of neurons in different areas of the brain, mainly in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Three bats tested by direct immunofluorescence and mouse inoculation were also positive for rabies. These data demonstrate that M. molossus may be infected with the rabies virus and develop rabies, even without histologic lesions in the central nervous system, and can be a source of infection for humans and domestic animals.",

A recent phylogeographical study using molecular markers described a scenario in which this species is formed by 5 distinct geographically circumscribed mitochondrial clades. Here we studied the craniometric variation of the common vampire bat to assess the amount of subdivision within this species and to test for the possibility of distinct morphological patterns associated with geographical lineages. We used 16 measurements from 1,581 complete skulls of adult D. rotundus representing 226 localities in South America and Mesoamerica. The assessment of morphological diversity between groups was done by the estimation of minimum FST values. Overall, the results show that most of the within-species variation is a result of the size component. Both shape data and size data are correlated with geographic distances. Our results favor the origin of biological diversity as the outcome of genetic drift and stepping-stone pattern of gene flow instead of local adaptations to local environmental conditions. The FST analyses also support male-biased dispersal. The results give little evidence to support previous suggestions that the common vampire bat may be composed of 2 or more species.",

On the basis of histological sections, the structures of a pair of testis containing the seminiferous tubules of adults were compacted in organization with spermatogenic cells. The epididymis has a thinner muscular region than the vas deferens with longitudinal folds on the mucosal lining. Two portions were observed in the prostate gland, while seminal vesicle has numerous trabeculae and bulbourethral gland was observed to have multiacini. There was increase in thickness of muscular region, epithelial height, and luminal diameter of epididymis and vas deferens between adults and juveniles.

            "abstractNote": "Since 2006, bat populations in North America have suffered devastating mortality from an emerging disease known as white-nose syndrome (WNS). The causal agent of WNS is the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. In April 2014, WNS was discovered in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in Michigan, US, and has since been documented in 12 counties. Because current surveillance for WNS focuses primarily on mine-hibernating species in winter, it is subject to geographic, species, and seasonal bias. To investigate species affected and potential associations of gender, seasonal life cycle, and region with P. destructans prevalence, 1,040 rabies-negative bats were sampled from May 2014 to May 2015 from animals submitted as part of statewide rabies surveillance. The vast majority (96%) of the sample population consisted of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), a noncavernicolous species. Two methods were used to detect P. destructans: fluorescence of the muzzle, wing, and tail membranes under ultraviolet light and PCR targeting genomic DNA on wing samples. Only five bats (0.5%), all M. lucifugus, were confirmed positive after nucleic acid sequencing of PCR amplicons. No other species were infected. All infected bats were collected from April to May, coinciding with their emergence from hibernation. As P. destructans and WNS spread westward, novel surveillance streams may provide a useful tool for wildlife management agencies seeking to detect the fungus where winter hibernacula such as caves and mines are absent or otherwise inaccessible.",

Wild mammals are the natural reservoirs of these parasites, which are transmitted by hematophagous arthropods. The present study aimed to detect the natural occurrence of trypanosomatids through serological diagnosis, PCR of whole blood and blood culture (hemoculture), and phylogenetic relationships using small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), cytochrome b, and glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes. Samples from 131 wild animals, including rodents, marsupials, and bats, were sampled in six areas in the state of Maranha˜o, in a transition zone of semiarid climates northeast of the equatorial humid Amazon. Serological analysis for Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi was performed in opossums by indirect ﬂuorescent antibody test (IFAT), and all animals were serologically negative. Nine positive hemocultures (6.77%) were isolated and cryopreserved and from mammals of the Didelphimorphia and Chiroptera orders and positioned in phylogenies on the basis of sequences from different genes with reference strains of Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and T. cruzi. From primary samples (blood and tissues) only one bat, Pteronotus parnellii, was positive to SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes and grouped with the L. infantum chagasi branch. The studies conducted in Maranha˜o State provide knowledge of parasite diversity. It is important to determine the presence of trypanosomatids in wild mammals with synanthropic habits.",

The species is under threat from anthropogenic pressure on the little that remains of its forest habitat, now restricted to the islands’ upper elevations and steepest slopes. We report the results of the most comprehensive survey of this species to date, and present recommendations for ongoing field conservation efforts and monitoring. Morning counts were conducted at roost sites in the wet and dry seasons during –. Habitat structure around the roosting sites was characterized and roost numbers compared, to investigate the potential effect of habitat loss and degradation. We estimate the population to comprise c. , individuals distributed across  roosts on the two islands. All occupied roosting sites were restricted to a narrow altitudinal range, and roosting populations in agroforestry areas were smaller than those found in degraded and undisturbed forest. Only one of the  roosts on Anjouan was found in undisturbed, old-growth forest with no nearby signs of clearance for agriculture or landslides following tree-felling upslope. Following a suspected severe population decline as a result of widespread and long-term forest loss Livingstone’s fruit bat has been recategorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.",

Assuming that (1: hypothesis of the effect of the decade) the addition of new occurrence records over time increases the potential size of the species distribution; and (2: Wallacean distance hypothesis) over the years, the new points added are increasingly distant from the research centers. Considering the geographic knowledge gap of this species, our objective is to report a new record of this species and estimate its potential distribution in South America through environment niche models (ENMs). For this, we compiled records of occurrence of species, selected from 1900 to 2015. We used 19 bioclimatic variables available in the WorldClim database to estimate the potential distribution of the species, and we used three modeling algorithms: Maximum Entropy (MXT), Random Forest (RDF), and Support Vector Machine. To test the Wallacean distance hypothesis, we calculated the Euclidian distance from occurrences to bat research centers in Brazil, located using a national researchers’ information dataset (“Plataforma Lattes”). To test the hypothesis of the decade effect, we used the beta regression analysis, taking conservative and non‐conservative approaches. The results showed that the predicted area expanded and retracted with the addition of new occurrences over the decades, with an improvement in the accuracy of models. Most records are located in the southeastern region of Brazil, but algorithms predicted areas in regions where there are no records. Only the conservative approach has had a positive relationship over the decades. The distance from new points does not increase over the years of research centers.",

After a secondary peak in September-October observed in both sexes in E. isabellinus, in males only in P. kuhlii, body mass reached a minimum value in winter when activity is low. Significant differences were also noticed between years in June for both species. Such pattern of seasonal variations of sexual size dimorphism is typical of hibernating vespertilionids.",

This bat species was captured throughout the year but only at water bodies and particularly at Nouh basin. Captures peaked in late spring — early summer, and declined in winter. Pregnant females were captured from April to June, and lactating females in May and June. Echolocation calls were recorded throughout the year, but not every month in all habitats. Most activity was reported at water bodies and street lamps. Activity peaked in late spring and early autumn, and declined during winter period. Terminal buzzes were mainly detected at basins, peaking in late spring — early summer and early autumn. Our study provided further insights on the importance of water bodies which should draw particular attention in the management plan of the national park and in the whole country.",

            "abstractNote": "The efficiency with which flying animals convert metabolic power to mechanical power dictates an individual's flight behaviour and energy requirements. Despite the significance of this parameter, we lack empirical data on conversion efficiency for most species as\n              in vivo\n              measurements are notoriously difficult to obtain. Furthermore, conversion efficiency is often assumed to be constant across flight speeds, even though the components driving flight power are speed-dependent. We show, through direct measurements of metabolic and aerodynamic power, that conversion efficiency in the migratory bat (\n              Pipistrellus nathusii\n              ) increases from 7.0 to 10.4% with flight speed. Our findings suggest that peak conversion efficiency in this species occurs near maximum range speed, where the cost of transport is minimized. A meta-analysis of 16 bird and 8 bat species revealed a positive scaling relationship between estimated conversion efficiency and body mass, with no discernible differences between bats and birds. This has profound consequences for modelling flight behaviour as estimates assuming 23% efficiency underestimate metabolic costs for\n              P. nathusii\n              by almost 50% on average (36–62%). Our findings suggest that conversion efficiency may vary around an ecologically relevant optimum speed and provide a crucial baseline for investigating whether this drives variation in conversion efficiency between species.",

Physical and ultrasound examinations were suggestive of an abdominal mass with free ﬂuid within the abdomen. Based on the poor and deteriorating clinical condition of the animal, euthanasia was elected. Gross necropsy revealed an irregular thickening at the root of the mesentery and a diffusely, dark-red liver with rounded hepatic margins. Histologic examination revealed extensive neoplastic effacement of the pancreas with invasion into the surrounding mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes and metastatic spread to the liver. Based on the morphology of the neoplastic cells, the involvement of the pancreas, and immunohistochemistry, a diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma was made. Additionally, two small neoplasms were identiﬁed in the lungs. These masses were distinct from the carcinoma, and their morphology was consistent with bronchioloalveolar adenomas. This is the ﬁrst known report of either benign pulmonary lesions or pancreatic carcinomas in the order Chiroptera.",

Carcasses of Hutton's shearwaters were collected over three field seasons, and where predation was probable, the bodies were autopsied. Paired bites identified stoats as the principal predator of Hutton's shearwater, but also revealed that a feral cat was present within the colony. Stoats killed their prey with a bite to the back of the neck or head, and commenced feeding on the neck or head. Despite the limited number of catkilled birds, cats appeared to feed on Hutton's shearwaters differently from stoats, starting on the breast muscles. Harriers and kea left sign that allowed birds killed or scavenged by these native birds to be distinguished from those killed by stoats or cats.",

            "abstractNote": "Phenology refers to the timing of events in the annual cycle of organisms. For temperate-zone mammals, hibernation is one such event, but little is known about its phenology. Hibernation consists of energy-saving torpor bouts interspersed with energetically expensive arousals to normothermic T b, and hibernators should benefit from mechanisms which reduce arousal costs and help them time arousals to coincide with foraging opportunities. In a previous study, we showed that, in contrast to hibernating bats from warmer climates, little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) from central Canada abandon a circadian pattern to arousal in the middle of winter when there is no chance of feeding. Here, we used temperature telemetry to test whether they would re-synchronize arousals with normal foraging time (i.e. sunset) during late winter as the chance of foraging or emergence opportunities improves, and whether they would synchronize arousals with conspecifics, possibly to exploit social thermoregulation. We also used passive transponders to test whether energy reserves and/or sex differences in reproductive timing influence phenology and the sensitivity of emergence timing to environmental cues. In contrast to patterns in mid-winter, after 7 April 2013, bats synchronized arousals with sunset and with conspecifics. Females emerged earlier than males, and females in the best condition emerged first while body condition had no influence on male emergence timing. Both male and female bats appeared to time emergence with falling barometric pressure, a cue that predicts favourable foraging conditions for bats but which, unlike outside temperature, would have been readily detectable by bats inside the hibernaculum. Our results highlight hibernation traits associated with extreme winter energy limitation for insect-eating bats in cold climates and illustrate the influence of reproductive timing and environmental conditions on hibernation energetics and phenology.",

The 1st new species was previously included in M. tubinaris (Scully, 1881) but is considered distinct due to differences in external and craniodental features. This new species is widespread in continental Southeast Asia and relatively well represented in museum collections, whereas the other new species are known only from a few specimens collected at scattered localities. The new taxa are known only from forested areas, which highlights the incompleteness of existing knowledge and strong potential for further discoveries in the region.",

This record expands the species’ distributional range in Mexico along the peninsula. We propose 2 plausible biogeographical explanations. First, the species has the ability to travel across the Gulf of California from the coast of Sonora to the eastern side of the Baja California peninsula and there establish. Second, there is a continuous distribution of the species throughout the mountain ranges that run longitudinally along the Baja California peninsula from the United States border down to the southern tip. We collected one male specimen of E. underwoodi in xeric-riparian habitat. We suggest a continuous distribution pattern of this species along the cliffs in the Baja California peninsula.",

Individuals of this species roost in tight clusters, and emit an acoustically rich repertoire of calls whose behavioral significance is largely unknown. We recorded their social and vocal behaviors within a colony housed under semi-natural conditions. We also quantified the spatial spread of each bat’s roosting location and discovered that this was relatively fixed and roughly confined to an individual’s body width. The spatial precision in roosting was accompanied by an equally remarkable match between specific vocalizations and well-timed, discrete, identifiable postures/behaviors, as revealed by logistic regression analysis. The bodily behaviors included crouching, marking, yawning, nipping, flicking, fighting, kissing, inspecting, and fly-bys. Two echolocation-like calls were used to maintain spacing in the colony, two noisy broadband calls were emitted during fights, two tonal calls conveyed fear, and another tonal call signaled appeasement. Overall, the results establish that mustached bats exhibit complex social interactions common to other social mammals. The correspondence of relatively low frequency and noisy, broadband calls with aggression, and of tonal, high frequency calls with fear supports Morton’s Motivation-Structure hypothesis, and establishes a link between motivation and the acoustic structure of social calls emitted by mustached bats.",

We present the first known observations of diurnal activity of Rhinolophus lepidus in forests on Tioman Island, Malaysia, recorded using visual surveys and acoustic monitoring. The bats were flying during the day and at night, and feeding buzzes detected suggest that they were actively foraging during the day. This appears to be a regular phenomenon on Tioman Island. The absence of resident diurnal avian predators that hunt below the forest canopy may account for the diurnal activity of R. lepidus in forests there.",

These parasites belong to the diverse group of malaria parasites, and Polychromophilus presents the only haemosporidian taxon that infects mammalian hosts in tropical as well as in temperate climate zones. This study provides the first information of Polychromophilus parasites in the lesser Asiatic yellow bat (Scotophilus kuhlii) in Thailand, a common vespertilionid bat species distributed in South and Southeast Asia. The gametocyte blood stages of the parasites could not be assigned to a described morphospecies and molecular analysis revealed that these parasites might represent a distinct Polychromophilus species. In contrast to Plasmodium species, Polychromophilus parasites do not multiply in red blood cells and, thus, do not cause the clinical symptoms of malaria. Parasitological and molecular investigation of haemosporidian parasites of wildlife, such as the neglected genus Polychromophilus, will contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of malaria parasites.",

This is only the third published dietary study of the species, considered to have a high conservation priority in Europe. Pond bats’ prey was dominated by non-biting midges (Chironomidae — both imagines and pupae) and caddis flies (Trichoptera). However, the spectrum of prey was relatively broad, with 16 taxa, including 12 recorded for the first time in the diet of M. dasycneme. Frequency of occurrence (O%) of particular taxa varied through the season. O% of caddis flies and non-biting midges in droppings were negatively correlated (rs = -0.75, P < 0.05); exceptionally high O% of caddis flies, being larger (and presumably more profitable) prey, occurred in late June and July, coinciding with high energy demands of lactating females. No evidence of piscivory was revealed.",

Animals can achieve omnivory using different strategies, for example opportunistic foraging, or switching between multiple trophic niches.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The Neotropical bat\n                    Glossophaga soricina\n                    (Pallas, 1766) is a common and widespread species known for nectar feeding, but it also eats fruit and insects. Approaching stationary objects (flowers and fruits) or moving objects (insects) poses different sensory tasks and should require different echolocation behaviours. Here we tested the contrasting hypothesis that\n                    G. soricina\n                    can approach both stationary and moving objects using the same echolocation behaviour, thus feeding at different trophic levels by a single sensory mechanism.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Using\n                    DNA\n                    barcoding, we demonstrate that\n                    G. soricina\n                    eats beetles (Coleoptera), flies (Diptera) and noctuid moths with bat‐detecting ears. Laboratory observations show that\n                    G. soricina\n                    actively hunts for prey so insect consumption does not appear to be opportunistic. After capture, individuals consumed prey while perched and manipulated them with jaw, thumb, wrist and wing movements, but food handling was longer and chewing rate slower than in obligate insectivores.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    In contrast to most insectivorous bats, the echolocation calls of\n                    G. soricina\n                    are of high frequency and low intensity, and\n                    G. soricina\n                    did not produce feeding buzzes when approaching insects. An acoustic model of detection distances shows that its low‐intensity calls fail to trigger the auditory neurons of eared moths, allowing\n                    G. soricina\n                    to overcome auditory prey defences.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Individuals achieved niche flexibility using a unique but generalist behavioural approach rather than employing two different specialist methods. Our findings provide a novel insight into the functional mechanisms of insect capture in\n                    G. soricina\n                    and highlight the importance of considering niche flexibility in classifying trophic links in ecological communities.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Small isolated populations are vulnerable to both stochastic events and the negative consequences of genetic drift. For threatened species, the genetic management of such populations has therefore become a crucial aspect of conservation. Flying foxes (\n              Pteropus\n              spp, Chiroptera) are keystone species with essential roles in pollination and seed dispersal in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Yet many flying fox species are also threatened, having experienced dramatic population declines driven by habitat loss and hunting. The insular Ryukyu flying fox (\n              Pteropus dasymallus\n              ) ranges from the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan through Taiwan to the northern Philippines and has undergone precipitous population crashes on several islands in recent decades. To assess the population genetic structure and diversity in\n              P. dasymallus\n              , and its likely causes, we analyzed mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA. Both markers showed significant genetic differentiation among most island populations, with mitochondrial haplotypes showing some mixing across the regions, likely reflecting historical colonization and/or dispersal events. In contrast, microsatellite markers showed an overall pattern of isolation by distance; however, this pattern appeared to be driven by the presence of deep ocean trenches between geographically distant populations. Thus, the current distribution of\n              P. dasymallus\n              and its subspecific diversity appear to have arisen through vicariance coupled with a long history of restricted gene flow across oceanic barriers. We conclude that isolated island subgroups should be managed separately, with efforts directed at reducing further declines in genetic diversity.",

All of the flying foxes were captured from the same roost, and GPS locations were collected for 1 month. The habitats used by each bat were characterized through ground‐truthing, and a spatial distribution model was developed of foraging sites.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  A total of 13,643 valid locations were collected during the study. Our study bats flew approximately 20 km from the roost each night to forage. The maximum distance traveled per night ranged from 6.88–105 km and averaged 28.3 km. Six of the 14 bats visited another roost for at least one night during the study, including one roost located 105 km away.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Most foraging locations were in residential areas (53.7%) followed by plantations (26.6%). Our spatial distribution model confirmed that residential areas were the preferred foraging habitat for\n                    P. lylei\n                    , although our results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of individuals studied.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    : Our findings suggest that the use of residential and agricultural habitats by\n                    P. lylei\n                    may create opportunities for bats to interact with humans and livestock. They also suggest the importance of anthropogenic habitats for conservation of this vulnerable and ecologically important group in Cambodia. Our mapping of the probability of occurrence of foraging sites will help identification of areas where public awareness should be promoted regarding the ecosystem services provided by flying foxes and potential for disease transmission through indirect contact.",
