            "abstractNote": "Bats act as a natural reservoir for many viruses, including coronaviruses, and have played a crucial epidemiological role in the emergence of many viral diseases. Coronaviruses have been known for 60 years. They are usually responsible for the induction of mild respiratory signs in humans. However, since 2002, the bat-borne virus started to induce fatal epidemics according to WHO reports. In this year, the first serious human coronavirus epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS) occurred (China, 8098 cases, 774 deaths [9.5% of the cases] in 17 countries). The case fatality was higher in elderly patients above 60 years and reached 50% of the cases. SARS epidemic was followed 10 years later by the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia (in 2012, 2260 cases, 803 deaths [35.5% of the cases] in 27 countries). Finally, in December 2019, a new epidemic in Wuhan, China, (corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19) emerged and could spread to 217 countries infecting more than 86,255,226 cases and killing 1,863,973 people by the end of 2020. There are many reasons why bats are ideal reservoir hosts for viral diseases such as the tolerance of their immune system to the invading viruses for several months. They can actively shed the viruses, although they develop no clinical signs (will be discussed in details later in the review). Bats were directly or indirectly involved in the three previous coronavirus epidemics. The indirect transmission takes place via intermediate hosts including civet cats for SARS and dromedary camels in the case of MERS. Although bats are believed to be the source of COVID-19 pandemic, direct pieces of evidence are still lacking. Therefore, coronaviruses’ role in epidemics induction and the epidemiological role of bats are discussed. The current work also presents different evidence (phylogenetic data, animal experiments, bats artificial infection studies, and computerized models of SARS-CoV2 evolution) that underline the involvement of bats in the epidemiology of the pandemic.",

We quantiﬁed foraging behavior of C. sphinx as individuals fed on fruits of Annona squamosa, leaves of Cassia ﬁstula and Mimusops elengi, and fruits and leaves of Coccinia indica. After making several circling ﬂights and engaging in brief hovering bouts, bats typically land directly on a single fruit and remove all or part of it with the mouth. In contrast, individuals remove leaves from trees during ﬂight, without landing or hovering. C. sphinx typically transports fruits and leaves to feeding roosts where it extracts soluble contents and expels ﬁbrous spats beneath day and feeding roosts. This bat consumes mostly fruits upon emergence from day roosts and feeds on leaves later in the night. These temporal differences in nightly foraging behavior may reﬂect the higher water and carbohydrate (energy) contents of fruits, compared with leaves, and help sustain ﬂight activity throughout the night.",

Fox), associated with the bats Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte) and Tadarida brasiliensis (I. Geof. St. Hilaire), respectively, are described. C. stanfordi has the second posterior-row seta on abdominal segments 1Ð5 at most one fourth the length of the Þrst and third setae, but it is unique among the Leptopsyllini with Þve short setae in abdominal segment 9 anterior row. E. faceta has the straight line of anterior-row setae 2Ð5 on abdominal segment 1, which is diagnostic for Phalacropsyllini. O. howardi and O. pseudarctomys have three anterior-row setae on the anal comb, three ventrolatera1 setae on the anal segment (abdominal segment 10), and a narrow mandible with Þve or more teeth as other Ceratopyl1inae, but O. pseudarctomys is distinguishable from O. howardi because the Þrst setae on the posterior row of the head is long (greater than one half the length of the third posterior-row setae), the ventral setae on abdominal segment 7 are different sizes, and the third anterior-row setae on abdominal segment 8 does not extend past the spiracle posterior to it. Bat ßea larvae have six posterior-row setae on abdominal segments 1Ð9 with the anal comb anterior row with two or more setae; M. insignis has eight mandible teeth and S. distincta texana three to four.",

This has important implications for conservation management. We present novel data on species diversity and composition for three taxa (bats, geometrid moths and plants) in forests at two stages of secondary growth located in the Aberdare Mountains in Central Kenya. We found no signiﬁcant differences in alpha diversity for any of the sampled groups between forest types. However, we found disturbance-driven differences of tree and herb community compositions and correlations between tree and moth –and tree and shrub community compositions. Changes in community compositions were more pronounced using an abundance-based indicator (Bray–Curtis) in comparison with an incidence based (Sørensen). Our results demonstrate that solely working with alpha diversity values can be misleading in conservation planning as they might not reﬂect compositional changes between habitats. Furthermore, abundance-based compositional measures appear to be superior to incidence-based measures for detecting subtle effects of disturbance on biodiversity.",

The head of this species is dorsoventrally ﬂattened, which is characteristic of this genus. Fleshy pads are present on the pollex and heel in members of this genus and are used in positioning the body inside the internodes of bamboo stalks. T. pachypus is intermediate in size between the larger T. robustula and the smaller T. pygmaeus. These species are sympatric throughout much of their ranges, which include South China, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Borneo, and the Philippines.",

Specimens of these species were divided into population samples based on geographic proximity. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that both species are sexually dimorphic. Results of principle components analysis illustrated interspecific differences. In areas of sympatry, specimens were subjected to discriminant analysis to confirm their identity. Based on this analysis, classification functions are provided as a useful aid for identifying the two species.",

The assessment has been performed following a methodology composed of information collection and compilation, expert judgement on each criterion at individual and, if no consensus was reached before, also at collective level. The output is composed of the categorical answer, and for the questions where no consensus was reached, the different supporting views are reported. Details on the methodology used for this assessment are explained in a separate opinion. According to the assessment performed, Ebola virus disease can be considered eligible to be listed for Union intervention as laid down in Article 5(3) of the AHL. The disease would comply with the criteria as in Sections 4 and 5 of Annex IV of the AHL, for the application of the disease prevention and control rules referred to in points (d) and (e) of Article 9(1). The animal species to be listed for Ebola virus disease according to Article 8(3) criteria are some species of non-human primates, pigs and rodents as susceptible species and some species of fruit bats as reservoir, as indicated in the present opinion.",

The two species are similar in diet and foraging-habitat use but differ in current roosting habitat, and exhibit contrasting regional population trends. Evening bat, Nycticeius humeralis (Rafinesque, 1818), populations are declining in central Indiana, whereas big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus (Beauvois, 1796), populations are increasing. We assessed habitat selection by 22 adult female bats using radiotelemetry and compositional analysis. Eptesicus fuscus used several roosts across the study area; all but one roosted in human-made structures. Nycticeius humeralis clustered roosts within a small group of woodlots; all roosted in tree cavities. Eptesicus fuscus foraged for longer periods of time and nonreproductive individuals of this species had larger foraging ranges than N. humeralis. Both species foraged primarily in agricultural and wooded areas. During foraging, N. humeralis showed greater foraging-site fidelity and a stronger selection for agricultural and wooded areas than E. fuscus. We suggest that N. humeralis in our study area is probably more sensitive to suburban development near their roosts than E. fuscus.",

            "abstractNote": "Ebola virus infection of human dendritic cells (DCs) induces atypical adaptive immune responses and thereby exacerbates Ebola virus disease (EVD). Human DCs, infected with Ebola virus aberrantly express low levels of the DC activation markers CD80, CD86 and MHC class II. The T cell responses ensuing are commonly anergic rather than protective against EVD. We hypothesise that DCs derived from potential reservoir hosts such as bats, which do not develop disease signs in response to Ebola virus infection, would exhibit features associated with activation. In this study, we have examined Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) infection of DCs derived from the Angolan free-tailed bat species, Mops condylurus. This species was previously identified as permissive to EBOV infection in vivo, in the absence of disease signs. This bat species has also been recently implicated as the reservoir host for Bombali ebolavirus, a virus species that is closely related to EBOV. Due to the absence of pre-existing M condylurus species-specific reagents, we characterised its de novo assembled transcriptome and defined its phylogenetic similarity to other mammals, which enabled the identification of cross-reactive reagents for bat-BMDC differentiation and immune cell phenotyping. Our results reveal that M condylurus bone marrow-derived DCs (bat-BMDCs) are susceptible to EBOV infection as determined by detection of EBOV specific viral RNA (vRNA). vRNA increased significantly 72 hours after EBOV-infection and was detected in both cells and in culture supernatants. Bat-BMDC infection was further confirmed by the observation of GFP expression in DC cultures infected with a recombinant GFP-EBOV. Bat-BMDCs upregulated CD80 and C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) transcripts in response to EBOV infection, which positively correlated with the expression levels of EBOV vRNA. In contrast to the aberrant responses to EBOV infection that are typical for human-DC, our findings from bat-BMDCs provide evidence for an immunological basis of asymptomatic EBOV infection outcomes.",

            "abstractNote": "This paper attempts to expand on the current knowledge regarding the evolutionary history of bat haemosporidian parasites. Using modern molecular tools as adjuncts to existing morphological descriptions, our understanding of the diversity of these parasites is discussed. The biogeography and host range distribution together with possible host-parasite interactions remain to be evaluated in more detail. Using a nested-PCR cytochrome b mitochondrial gene approach, we established a screening programme and survey of several months duration for haemosporidian parasites in four central African bat species living in an ecological community. The aim of the study was to describe parasites morphologically and molecularly, together with parasite prevalence variations over time, and evaluate parasite host-speciﬁcity in these sympatric cave bats. Over the survey period, Polychromophilus melanipherus was the only haemosporidian parasite identiﬁed in Miniopterus inﬂatus, with a continuous molecular prevalence of at least 60%. Molecular phylogenetic analyses show that P. melanipherus is a monophyletic group infecting Miniopterus bats which is, a sister group to P. murinus and Polychromophilus spp. This monophyletic group is composed of different cyt b haplotypes molecularly distantly related (but morphologically similar), circulating without geographic or host species distinction. This suggests that P. melanipherus is a species complex restricted to the family Miniopteridae. The phylogenetic analysis conﬁrms that Polychromophilus parasites are distributed worldwide and supports the view that they are more closely related to avian haemosporidian parasites.",

            "abstractNote": "Hillis (2006) recently published a rebuttal of my analysis (Dubois, 2006c) of a paper by Hillis and Wilcox (2005) on the taxonomy and nomenclature of American ranid frogs. His paper consists not only in a reply to my paper, as it contains in fact three distinct kinds of statements: (1) an attempt to ‘‘save’’ the new generic nomina proposed by Hillis and Wilcox (2005) from being considered nomina nuda under the Code; (2) another plea for the superiority of the Phylocode over the Code, especially as regards the absence of a Rule of Coordination and the substitution of ‘‘phylogenetic deﬁnition’’ of nomina to the use of onomatophores for the allocation of nomina to taxa; (3) a plea for ‘‘taxonomic stability’’ in order not to upset the traditional use of nomina and to please users of electronic data bases. These three points are here commented, as follows: (1) even with the best goodwill, under the rules of the Code it is possible to ‘‘save’’ only three or four of the seven new nomina of Hillis and Wilcox (2005), the others being indeed nomina nuda; furthermore, three of these seven nomina are deﬁnitively useless and redundant, being junior objective synonyms of other generic nomina; (2) the well-known arguments against the Phylocode do not need to be repeated in detail once again, the most important one being that replacement of a secular nomenclatural system by another one, whose theoretical and practical superiority is highly questionable, would cause considerable chaos and detract taxonomists from their urgent task of accelerating the collection, study and description of the living species of our planet; (3) the claim for taxonomic and nomenclatural stability ignores the importance of the taxonomic impediment and sends a misleading message to the scientiﬁc community and to society as a whole: in the present situation of our knowledge, taxonomic stability is ignorance, and the science of taxonomy would have much to lose to adapt its concepts and practices to the needs of databases at the expense of scientiﬁc quality. It is once again stressed that, for the quality and accuracy of communication between evolutionary biologists, and above all with other biologists and non-biologists, it is urgent that scientiﬁc periodicals impose the use of diﬀerent systems of notation of nomina following distinct nomenclatural systems, such as the Code and the Phylocode.",

Lyssavirus antigen was not detected in the brains, and isolation attempts in mice were unsuccessful. However, serologic tests demonstrated the presence of lyssavirus-neutralizing antibodies in bat sera. Of 140 sera tested, 27 (19%) neutralized Lagos bat virus, and two of these additionally neutralized Mokola virus. The positive samples originated from the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) and the Gambian epaulet bat (Epomophorus gambianus). No neutralizing activity was detected against other lyssaviruses including rabies, Duvenhage, and West Caucasian bat viruses.",

During the summers of 2002 and 2003, we used mist nets to capture bats (\n              Myotis yumanensis, M. californicus, M. evotis, M. thysanodes, Eptesicus fuscus, Lasionycteris noctivagans, Tadarida brasiliensis, Antrozous pallidus, Lasiurus borealis\n              , and\n              Lasiurus cinereus\n              ) in Whiskeytown National Recreation Area in north‐central California, USA. We used landscape‐scale variables, logistic regression, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC\n              c\n              ) to model species distributions and produce spatially discerning predictive occurrence maps. We developed a priori models that we used to determine which landscape‐scale variables best discriminated between capture sites and non‐capture sites. The odds of capturing a bat were 3.3 greater when total edge increased by 10,000 m, whereas for Yuma myotis (\n              Myotis yumanensis\n              ), the odds of predicting presence were 0.2 greater when distance to lakes and ponds decreased by 2,000 m. Elevation was important in predicting the distribution of silver‐haired bats (\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              ) and big brown bats (\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              ). Increasing elevation by 400 m decreased the odds of capturing a silver‐haired bat by 0.1 and a big brown bat by 0.4. Classification accuracy for our models ranged from 80.9% for all bat species combined to 72.3% for Yuma myotis and silver‐haired bats. Predictive occurrence models can be valuable to bat conservation efforts because they provide spatial data important for evaluating the effects of management activities on species distributions.",

The relationship between bite force and (gape angle) and the point along the tooth row at which bite point within each of seven species demonstrates that force is transferred to a food item (bite point). Despite the unilateral molar biting universally generates the highest widespread use of these models in comparative analyses, forces while the unilateral canine biting produces the experimental data documenting bite force in non-human lowest forces. Bilateral canine biting is intermediate. mammals are extremely limited. The goal of this study is Beyond these general patterns, differences among species to document variation in non-stimulated bite force suggest that bite force reﬂects variation in craniofacial associated with change in gape angle and bite point in architecture. Finally, these data suggest that behavioral a broad range of species. We focus on plant-visiting variation in gape angle and bite point may be important bats because they exhibit a relatively primitive cranial variables in comparative, functional analyses of feeding.",

            "abstractNote": "Gene ﬂow was estimated in the tropical tree Hymenaea courbaril using indirect measures based on the proportion of total genetic diversity from differences among populations (FST) and using direct paternity analyses. Outcrossing estimates (tm ¼ 1:07) are consistent with indications that H. courbaril is self-incompatible. Direct estimates of pollen gene ﬂow into two small (n < 6) stands of trees indicate that 42% and 62% of the pollen came from outside the stand. Despite this level of external gene ﬂow, genetic drift is expected to cause divergence of populations over time (migration rate Nem ¼ 0:40 and 0.63), mainly because of the small number of adult trees within each population. Indirect estimates of gene ﬂow based on nine larger populations of 21–48 trees gave estimates of 2.91 migrants per generation, but the absence of migration-drift equilibrium renders this estimate unreliable. Analysis of pollen movement among 21 adult trees indicated that the effective number of fathers was only 6.9, with the majority of pollinations coming from just three trees. Asynchronous ﬂowering, and perhaps restricted use of ﬂowering resources by bats, the primary pollinators of H. courbaril, is the likely cause of this low number. Genetic diversity values based on 31 allozyme loci were lower than those reported for other outcrossing, gravity-dispersed tree species. Few effective fathers, and a relatively low population density, are the likely reasons.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are excellent bioindicators and are increasingly used to assess ecosystem health and monitor changes in the environment. Due to increased awareness of the potential transmission of pathogens from bats to humans and recognizing the limitations of traditional bat sampling methods, the use of of non-invasive sampling techniques such as bat recorders were recommended for field-based monitoring studies. In the Philippines, however, bat bioacoustics is still a growing field, and the scarcity of acoustic data hinders the use of echolocation calls to conduct accurate inventories and population monitoring of echolocating bats. Here, we recorded and characterized echolocation calls of insectivorous bats from caves and karst areas located in southern Luzon Island, Philippines. In addition, we compared our results with other studies performed within and outside the country to identify possible regional and local variation in acoustic characters for some species. A total of 441 echolocation calls were recorded from six bat families: Hipposideridae (five species), Rhinolophidae (five species), Vespertilionidae (three species), Miniopteridae (two species), Megadermatidae (one species), and Emballonuridae (one species). Discriminant function analyses (DFA) with leave-one-out cross validation correctly classified bats emitting calls dominated with a constant frequency (CF) component (rhinolophids and hipposiderids) with >97% success and those producing frequency modulated (FM) calls (Miniopteridae and Vespertilionidae) with 88.9% success. We report echolocation calls for Philippine population of two species (Megaderma spasma and Hipposideros lekaguli) for the first time. Moreover, we present geographical variations in call frequencies for some species by comparing previously reported acoustic data elsewhere across the species’ range. This underscores the importance of establishing a readily accessible and comprehensive local reference library of echolocation calls which would serve as a valuable resource for examining taxonomic identities of echolocating bats, particularly those whose calls exhibit biogeographic variations.",

It is the first cause of adult acute meningitis in some sub-Saharan African countries with a mortality rate of about 100% in cases of inappropriate therapy. This study aimed at examining the occurrence and the antifungal patterns of Cryptococcus isolates from pigeon droppings and bat guanos in the west region of Cameroon.\n\nMethods\nA total of 350 samples were randomly collected from three selected localities of west region of Cameroon. The identification was performed based on capsule production assessed by Indian ink preparation. Additional tests performed were urea broth, glycine and tryptophan assimilation tests. The antifungal susceptibility test was performed by the broth microdilution method.\n\nResults\nMycological analysis led to the identification of 98 isolates, of which 57 isolates of C. neoformans var. gattii and 41 isolates of C. neoformans var. neoformans. All the isolates showed resistance to antifungals tested except nystatin which showed MIC mean values ranging between 0.5 µg/mL and 0.65 µg/mL.\n\nConclusion\nThe prevalence of C. neoformans in pigeons and bats excreta in the west region of Cameroon is 28.57 %. C. neoformans var. gattii and C. neoformans var. neoformans are the main serotypes. Isolates found to be resistant to fluconazole and ketoconazole. Our results emphasize the need for further study on the molecular epidemiology in comparison with clinical isolates.",

            "abstractNote": "Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis frequently reported worldwide, caused by a spirochete of the genus Leptospira. It is capable of infecting domestic animals, free-living animals, and humans. Among wild animals, the role of bats in the epidemiology of leptospirosis has been investigated but is far from being elucidated. The Amazonian biome has the ideal conditions for maintaining and disseminating leptospires and, despite efforts that have been made to better understand leptospires’ occurrence in wild animals in the region, few studies aimed to explore and genetically characterize leptospires in bats. Based on this, the aim of the present study is to deeper investigate and genetically characterize leptospires detected in bats from the southwest Amazon. Animals were trapped by mist netting at five sites in the state of Acre, Brazil. Kidney samples were obtained and stored for molecular analysis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted first based on the LipL32 gene, and positive samples were submitted to rrs and secY-PCR and sequencing. Sequences were then submitted to phylogenetic analyses through multiple bioinformatic tools. The rrs sequences from the present study formed one single haplotype, different from any other previously deposited, grouped in a highly supported cluster with sequences from bats from Madagascar and China. The initial secY screening revealed no identity with previously deposited sequences. The phylogenetic trees revealed the sequences from the present study in an isolated branch, clearly separated from all previously known pathogenic Leptospira spp., suggesting the existence of a potentially undescribed species. The haplotype network including only leptospires from the Amazon region confirmed two new haplotypes from the same taxon unity, isolated from the others, with a probable origin of the species from L. noguchii. The characterization of this potentially new species in bats reinforces the complexity of the transmission dynamics of leptospires, including wild, periurban, and urban environments, emphasizing the need for an integrative look at leptospirosis vigilance within the context of One Health.",

In this work, I present information related to the diversity of bat species in the Amazonian region of Iquitos, Peru, where nearly 60% of the 152 bat species known to Peru recorded. Unlike in previous investigations in this area, bat surveys were designed to detect species living in urban and rural areas. The results have added a new bat species (Eumops delticus) to the Peruvian fauna, eight new species for the region around Iquitos (Peropteryx macrotis, Peropteryx pallidoptera, Anoura caudifer, Lionycteris spurrelli, Vampyrum spectrum, Thyroptera lavali, Cynomops planirostris, and Molossus coibensis), and a new species for Northeast Peru (Eumops maurus).",

            "abstractNote": "Pteropus seychellensis comorensis is the only Pteropodidae bat species on the island of Mayotte (Comoros Archipelago), and most aspects of its biology are unknown. In order to catch this large bat, we used a simple and low-cost method, consisting of raised mist nets that were set close to foraging sites. Major factors driving catch success were high food availability, good positioning of mist nets, and careful observation of movement patterns to identify foraging sites where the chances of capture are high. Blood was collected from the alar and humeral veins, which appear to be more practical for this purpose than other parts of the venous system.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              In temperate regions, winter is characterized by cold temperatures and low food availability. Heterothermic animals can bridge this period by entering a state of torpor characterized by decreased body temperature and reduced metabolic rate. Hibernation site choice is crucial since temperature conditions in the hibernaculum will impact torpor. We analysed temperature-dependent hibernation site use of\n              Barbastella barbastellus\n              . Bats and temperature were monitored in an underground system (1999–2019) and standalone bunkers (2007–2019) in Western Poland. During the winter of 2017–2018 we analysed the thermal variability of the hibernacula. Seasonal variation is higher in bunkers and thus temperatures get colder in winter than in the underground system. On the other hand, short-term variability (thermal variability index) in the bunkers was lower than in the underground system. This makes bunkers a more stable environment to hibernate for cold dwelling bats in warm winters, when temperatures in the bunkers do not get below freezing. Bats use both the warm underground system and the colder bunkers. During the last decade, a continuous series of warm winters occurred and the population of barbastelle bats partly moved from the underground system to the bunkers. These present temperature increases broadened the range of potential hibernation sites for barbastelles. Our study indicates that long-term trends, seasonal variation and short-term variability in temperatures are all important and should be analysed to investigate hibernaculum use by bats. Our study shows that small hibernation sites may become more important in the future.",

A proposed environmental management option, primarily to save energy, is to alter the duration of night lighting. Using the greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum as an example of a photophobic species, we explored roadside behaviour patterns throughout the night to assess the potential impact of part-night lighting. We found a large primary peak in activity 1 h after sunset, followed by a smaller secondary peak before sunrise. Simulated part-night lighting scenarios reveal that to capture a large proportion of bat activity, streetlights should be switched off before midnight. Current proposed uses of part-night lighting are unlikely to capture natural peaks in activity for nocturnal species.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Reduced food availability is implicated in declines in avian aerial insectivores, but the effect of nutritional stress on mammalian aerial insectivores is unclear. Unlike birds, insectivorous bats provision their young through lactation, which might protect nursing juveniles when prey availability is low but could increase the energetic burden on lactating females. We analyzed a 15‐year capture–mark–recapture data set from 5312 individual little brown myotis (\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              ) captured at 11 maternity colonies in northwestern Canada, to test the hypothesis that nutritional stress is impacting these mammalian aerial insectivores. We used long‐bone (forearm [FA]) length as a proxy for relative access to nutrition during development, and body mass as a proxy for access to nutrition prior to capture. Average FA length and body mass both decreased significantly over the study period in adult females and juveniles, suggesting decreased access to nutrition. Effect sizes were very small, similar to those reported for declining body size in avian aerial insectivores. Declines in juvenile body mass were only observed in individuals captured in late summer when they were foraging independently, supporting our hypothesis that lactation provides some protection to nursing young during periods of nutritional stress. Potential drivers of the decline in bat size include one or both of (1) declining insect (prey) abundance, and (2) declining prey availability. Echolocating insectivorous bats cannot forage effectively during rainfall, which is increasing in our study area. The body mass of captured adult females and juveniles in our study was lower, on average, after periods of high rainfall, and higher after warmer‐than‐average periods. Finally, survival models revealed a positive association between FA length and survival, suggesting a fitness consequence to declines in body size. Our study area has not yet been impacted by bat white‐nose syndrome (WNS), but research elsewhere has suggested that fatter bats are more likely to survive infection. We found evidence for WNS‐independent shifts in the body size of little brown myotis, which can inform studies investigating population responses to WNS. More broadly, the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (e.g., disease, nutritional stress, climate change, and other pressures) on mammalian aerial insectivores require urgent attention.",

Brock Fenton’s research on bat ecology has always balanced clear communication of potential health risks associated with bats and the need to communicate these risks precisely to avoid unnecessary persecution of bats. Here, we integrate Brock’s work in the ﬁeld of disease ecology with that of his students and collaborators and consider the potential advantages of studying disease ecology of bats within the Canadian context. The broad distribution of a few common species across the vast landscape of present-day Canada provides an opportunity to untangle the impacts of environmental variation on host–pathogen interactions and disease severity, particularly in the context of climate change. The varying migratory strategies and social structure of the bat species found in Canada could also facilitate informative interspeciﬁc studies to better understand how bat health is affected by interactions among rapid environmental changes, physiological traits, and the social behaviour of different species. We propose a series of priority research questions and approaches that could further our understanding of bat health and disease ecology in Canada, inspired by the work of Brock, his colleagues, and students.",

            "abstractNote": "Coronaviruses play an important role as pathogens of humans and animals, and the emergence of epidemics like SARS, MERS and COVID-19 is closely linked to zoonotic transmission events primarily from wild animals. Bats have been found to be an important source of coronaviruses with some of them having the potential to infect humans, with other animals serving as intermediate or alternate hosts or reservoirs. Host diversity may be an important contributor to viral diversity and thus the potential for zoonotic events. To date, limited research has been done in Africa on this topic, in particular in the Congo Basin despite frequent contact between humans and wildlife in this region. We sampled and, using consensus coronavirus PCR-primers, tested 3,561 wild animals for coronavirus RNA. The focus was on bats (38%), rodents (38%), and primates (23%) that posed an elevated risk for contact with people, and we found coronavirus RNA in 121 animals, of which all but two were bats. Depending on the taxonomic family, bats were significantly more likely to be coronavirus RNA-positive when sampled either in the wet (Pteropodidae and Rhinolophidae) or dry season (Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae). The detected RNA sequences correspond to 15 alpha- and 6 betacoronaviruses, with some of them being very similar (>95% nucleotide identities) to known coronaviruses and others being more unique and potentially representing novel viruses. In seven of the bats, we detected RNA most closely related to sequences of the human common cold coronaviruses 229E or NL63 (>80% nucleotide identities). The findings highlight the potential for coronavirus spillover, especially in regions with a high diversity of bats and close human contact, and reinforces the need for ongoing surveillance.",

However, in recent years, it was shown that the taxonomic diversity within the genus Barbastella was underestimated, and B. darjelingensis sensu lato is highly variable, both morphologically and genetically. Transcaucasian and Central Asian populations were already raised to the species level as B. caspica. Populations from eastern and south-eastern Asia are still understudied and likely encompass undescribed species. Comparing results from mtDNA sequences, skull morphometry and baculum shape, we concluded that one of these putative species is represented by populations inhabiting Honshu, Hokkaido and Kunashir Islands, and provide a scientific description of this new species. Populations from Taiwan, southern China and Indochina represent a sister mitochondrial clade to this new species. However, available morphological material from these areas did not demonstrate a significant difference from the Himalayan B. darjelingensis. Therefore, we refuse to give this form any taxonomic status until further studies of more vast material are done.",

Studying collections of the Berlin Zoological Museum, I have found that three specimens from the Ph. swinhoei type series belong to H. armiger, while two other, including the holotype, to H. pratti. Since the Peters’ name is older, the species should be named H. swinhoei (Peters, 1871), and the whole species group should be renamed respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are the second largest mammalian order with an almost worldwide distribution. Bat taxonomy remained almost unchanged for decades, and the diversity of the order was underestimated. The advent of molecular methods brought change to chiropteran taxonomy. The number of families increased from 17–18 to 21, and the relationships between them were revised, as were the composition of suborders and superfamilies. The number of recognized species and genera went up by almost a third. As a discipline, bat taxonomy has changed much methodologically and conceptually. After its long reign, comparative morphology has faded into the background. It has become clear that characters can diverge and converge in related species, masking true phylogenetic relationships. Not writing morphology off entirely, it does necessitate resorting to finer structures or multivariate data analysis. Karyology is of limited use in bat taxonomy, but methods such as FISH add to the understanding of relationships between suprageneric taxa. Mitochondrial DNA sequences are easy to obtain, and their analysis yields well-supported phylogenetic trees, but reticular processes and other factors may mask taxon boundaries. To resolve the uncertainty, nuclear markers are used, and their number and choice depends on taxon characteristics. Overall, building a consistent chiropteran system calls for an integration of all mentioned approaches.",

            "abstractNote": "Hibernating animals deposit adipose tissue before hibernation to withstand long periods of reduced energy intake. Normally, adiposity is positively correlated with increased secretion from adipose tissue of the satiety hormone, leptin. During the prehibernatory phase of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, body mass and adiposity increased to a maximum within 12 days. Leptin secretion from adipose tissue in vitro and plasma leptin, however, increased before the increase in adiposity, then significantly decreased when adiposity increased. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) decreased when plasma leptin was increasing. This was followed by an increase in nonshivering thermogenic capacity and brown adipose tissue mass. We conclude that in the early prehibernatory phase, BMR decreases despite increasing plasma leptin levels, suggesting a state of relative leptin resistance at that time. At later stages, adiposity increases as BMR continues to decrease, and plasma leptin becomes dissociated from adiposity. Thus, in M. lucifugus, hibernation may be achieved partly by removing the metabolic signal of leptin during the fattening period of prehibernation.",

            "abstractNote": "Migration is widespread among vertebrates, yet bat migration has received little attention and only in the recent decades has a better understanding of it been gained. Migration can cause significant changes in behaviour and physiology, due to increasing energy demands and aerodynamic constraints. Dietary shifts, for example, have been shown to occur in birds before onset of migration. For bats, it is not known if a change in diet occurs during migration, although breeding season-related dietary preference has been documented. It is known that a diet rich in fats and the accumulation of fat deposits do increase the flight range of migratory bats. Some bat species can be regarded as long-distance migrants, covering up to 2000 km between summer and winter roosting areas. Pipistrellus nathusii (Vespertilionidae), a European long-distant migrant, travels each year along the Baltic Sea from north-eastern Europe to hibernate in central and southern Europe. This study presents data on the dietary habits of migrating Pipistrellus nathusii compared with those during the breeding season. We analysed faecal samples from bats on fall migration caught at the Ornithological Field Station in Pape, Latvia and from samples collected in North-Latvian summer roosts. We applied both morphological identification and molecular methods, as morphological methods also recognize life stages of prey and can contribute frequency data. The diets of bats on migration and breeding bats were similar, with Diptera and Lepidoptera comprising the major prey categories. However, certain prey groups could be explained by the different hunting habitats exploited during migration vs. summer residence.",
