            "abstractNote": "Bats are protected by national and international legislation in European countries, yet many species, particularly migratory aerial insectivores, collide with wind turbines which counteracts conservation efforts. Within the European Union it is legally required to curtail the operation of wind turbines at periods of high bat activity, yet this is not practiced at old wind turbines. Based on data from the national carcass repository in Germany and from our own carcass searches at a wind park with three turbines west of Berlin, we evaluated the magnitude of bat casualties at old, potentially poor-sited wind turbines operating without curtailment. We report 88 documented bat carcasses collected by various searchers over the 20-year operation period of this wind park from 2001 to 2021. Common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) and common pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) were most often found dead at these turbines. Our search campaign in August and September 2021 yielded a total of 18 carcasses. We estimated that at least 209 bats were likely killed during our field survey, yielding more than 70 casualties/wind turbine or 39 casualties/ MW in two months. Since our campaign covered only part of the migration season, we consider this value as an underestimate. The 20-year period of the wind park emphasises the substantial impact old turbines may have on bat individuals and populations when operating without cur­ tailments. We call for reconsidering the operation procedures of old wind turbines to stop the continuous loss of bats in Germany and other countries where turbine curtailments are even less practiced than in Germany.",

            "abstractNote": "Urbanization has significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems and acts as an environmental filter excluding certain species from local ecological communities. Specifically, it may be challenging for some animals to find enough food in urban environments to achieve a positive energy balance. Because urban environments favor small-sized bats with low energy requirements, we hypothesized that common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) acquire food at a slower rate and rely less on conspecifics to find prey in urban than in rural environments due to a low food abundance and predictable distribution of insects in urban environments. To address this, we estimated prey sizes and measured prey capture rates, foraging efforts, and the presence of conspecifics during hunting of 22 common noctule bats equipped with sensor loggers in an urban and rural environment. Even though common noctule bats hunted similar-sized prey in both environments, urban bats captured prey at a lower rate (mean: 2.4 vs. 6.3 prey attacks/min), and a lower total amount of prey (mean: 179 vs. 377 prey attacks/ foraging bout) than conspecifics from rural environments. Consequently, the energy expended to capture prey was higher for common noctules in urban than in rural environments. In line with our prediction, urban bats relied less on group hunting, likely because group hunting was unnecessary in an environment where the spatial distribution of prey insects is predictable, for example, in parks or around floodlights. While acknowledging the limitations of a small sample size and low number of spatial replicates, our study suggests that scarce food resources may make urban habitats unfavorable for large bat species with higher energy requirements compared to smaller bat species. In conclusion, a lower food intake may displace larger species from urban areas making habitats with high insect biomass production key for protecting large bat species in urban environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Urbanization is a major contributor to the loss of biodiversity. Its rapid progress is mostly at the expense of natural ecosystems and the species inhabiting them. While some species can adjust quickly and thrive in cities, many others cannot. To support biodiversity conservation and guide management decisions in urban areas, it is important to find robust methods to estimate the urban affinity of species (i.e. their tendency to live in urban areas) and understand how it is associated with their traits. Since previous studies mainly relied on discrete classifications of species' urban affinity, often involving inconsistent assessments or variable parameters, their results were difficult to compare. To address this issue, we developed and evaluated a set of continuous indices that quantify species' urban affinity based on publicly available occurrence data. We investigated the extent to which a species' position along the urban affinity gradient depends on the chosen index and how this choice affects inferences about the relationship between urban affinity and a set of morphological, sensory and functional traits. While these indices are applicable to a wide range of taxonomic groups, we examined their performance using a global set of 356 bat species. As bats vary in sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances, they provide an interesting case study. We found that different types of indices resulted in different rankings of species on the urban affinity spectrum, but this had little effect on the association of traits with urban affinity. Our results suggest that bat species predisposed to urban life are characterized by low echolocation call frequencies, relatively long call durations, small body size and flexibility in the selection of the roost type. We conclude that simple indices are appropriate and practical, and propose to apply them to more taxa to improve our understanding of how urbanization favours or filters species with particular traits.",

            "abstractNote": "The bat fauna of Australia comprises some 25% of all terrestrial species, yet we know very little of the demography, dispersal, and movement dynamics of most bat species. The Pilbara leaf-nosed bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia Pilbara form) is a threatened microbat that roosts exclusively in caves that occur in mineral rich deposits in the Pilbara region. Due to their specific roost microclimate requirements these bats cannot survive for long without a suitable roost and are sensitive to roost disturbance. Understanding the connectivity of roosts throughout the Pilbara is crucial for informed decisions to mitigate potential impacts to persistence of this species in areas under economic development. Along with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, we used reduced representation genomic sequencing of over 150 individuals from eight roost sites throughout the Pilbara and tested for landscape-scale population differentiation associated with the two major subregions — the Hamersley and Chichester, as well as finer-scale among roost variation. We found evidence of high rates of dispersal and low population structure within the Pilbara, indi­ cating one panmictic population, with mtDNA results suggesting evidence of some female phil­ opatry. Our results highlight the ongoing need for detailed genetic studies to provide critical insight to species dispersal, particularly in multi-use landscapes. We discuss the importance of identifying and retaining connectivity of key habitat to maintain genetic diversity and gene flow throughout panmictic populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Pituitary prolactin (PRL) shows an episodic pattern of evolution in mammals, with a slow underlying rate (near stasis) and periods of rapid change in some groups. PRL evolution in bats, the second most speciose mammalian order, has not previously been studied, and is examined here. Slow basal evolution of PRL is seen in some bats, particularly megabats, but in most microbat groups evolution of PRL is more rapid. Accelerated evolution of PRL is particularly notable in the family Vespertilionidae, where analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that it reflects adaptive evolution/positive selection. Remarkably, vespertilionid bats also show a large sequence insertion, of variable length, into exon 4 of PRL, giving a protein sequence 18–60 amino acids longer than normal, with the longest insertions in bats of the genus Myotis. An equivalent insertion has not been reported in PRL of any other vertebrate group. In the 3-dimensional structure of the complex between PRL and the extracellular domain (ecd) of its receptor (PRL:PRLR2) the inserted sequence is seen to be introduced in the short loop between helices 2 and 3 of PRL; it is far removed from the receptor-binding sites, and may not interfere with binding. The ecd of the receptor also shows variable rates of evolution, with a higher rate in the Vespertilionidae, but this is much less marked than for the hormone. The distribution of substitutions introduced into PRL during vespertilionid evolution appears to be non-random, and this and the evidence for positive selection suggests that the rapid evolution and insert sequence introduction were associated with a significant change in the biological properties of the hormone.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: In the past two decades, bats have emerged as an important model system to study host-pathogen interactions. More recently, it has been shown that bats may also serve as a new and excellent model to study aging, inflammation, and cancer, among other important biological processes. The cave nectar bat or lesser dawn bat (Eonycteris spelaea) is known to be a reservoir for several viruses and intracellular bacteria. It is widely distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India to Southeast Asia and pollinates several plant species, including the culturally and economically important durian in the region. Here, we report the whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, followed by subsequent de novo assembly, of the E. spelaea genome solely using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing platform. Findings: The newly assembled E. spelaea genome is 1.97 Gb in length and consists of 4,470 sequences with a contig N50 of 8.0 Mb. Identified repeat elements covered 34.65% of the genome, and 20,640 unique protein-coding genes with 39,526 transcripts were annotated. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the PacBio long-read sequencing platform alone is sufficient to generate a comprehensive de novo assembled genome and transcriptome of an important bat species. These results will provide useful insights and act as a resource to expand our understanding of bat evolution, ecology, physiology, immunology, viral infection, and transmission dynamics.",

Between species, the number of intact receptors can vary by orders of magnitude. However, the evolutionary processes behind variation in receptor number, and its link to ﬁtness-related behaviors are not well understood. From vomeronasal transcriptomes, we discovered the ﬁrst evidence of intact vomeronasal type-1 receptor (V1r) genes in bats, and we tested whether putatively functional bat receptors were orthologous to those of related taxa, or whether bats have evolved novel receptors. Instead of lineage-speciﬁc duplications, we found that bat V1rs show high levels of orthology to those of their relatives, and receptors are under comparative levels of purifying selection as non-bats. Despite widespread vomeronasal organ loss in bats, V1r copies have been retained for >65 million years. The highly conserved nature of bat V1rs challenges our current understanding of mammalian V1r function and suggests roles other than conspeciﬁc recognition or mating initiation in social behavior.",

However, the number of mammalian orders studied previously has been relatively limited, and the availability of sequence data via mammalian genome projects provides the potential for extending the range of GH gene sequences examined. Complete or nearly complete GH gene sequences for six mammalian species for which no data were previously available have been extracted from the genome databases—Dasypus novemcinctus (nine-banded armadillo), Erinaceus europaeus (western European hedgehog), Myotis lucifugus (little brown bat), Procavia capensis (cape rock hyrax), Sorex araneus (European shrew), Spermophilus tridecemlineatus (13-lined ground squirrel). In addition incomplete data for several other species have been extended. Examination of the data in detail and comparison with previously available sequences has allowed assessment of the reliability of deduced sequences. Several of the new sequences diﬀer substantially from the consensus sequence previously determined for eutherian GHs, indicating greater variability than previously recognised, and conﬁrming the episodic pattern of evolution. The episodic pattern is not seen for signal sequences, 50 upstream sequence or synonymous substitutions—it is speciﬁc to the mature protein sequence, suggesting that it relates to the hormonal function. The substitutions accumulated during the course of GH evolution have occurred mainly on the side of the hormone facing away from the receptor, in a non-random fashion, and it is suggested that this may reﬂect interaction of the receptor–bound hormone with other proteins or small ligands.",

ORs evolve via gene duplication in a birth-death fashion, neofunctionalizing and pseudogenizing over time. Olfaction is a primary sense used for food detection in plant-visiting bats, but the relationship between dietary specialization and OR repertoire diversity is unclear. Within neotropical Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae), many lineages are plant specialists, and some have a distinct OR repertoire compared to insectivorous species. Yet, whether specialization on particular plant genera is associated with the evolution of specialized, less diverse OR repertoires has never been tested. Using targeted sequence capture, we sequenced the OR repertoires of three sympatric species of short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia), which vary in their degree of specialization on the fruits of Piper plants. We characterized orthologous vs duplicated receptors among Carollia species, and explored the diversity and redundancy of the receptor gene repertoire. At the species level, the most dedicated Piper specialist, Carollia castanea, had lower OR diversity compared to the two generalists (C. sowelli and C. perspicillata), but we discovered a few unique sets of ORs within C. castanea with high redundancy of similar gene duplicates. These unique receptors potentially enable C. castanea to detect Piper fruit odorants better than its two congeners. Carollia perspicillata, the species with the most generalist diet, had a higher diversity of intact receptors, suggesting the ability to detect a wider range of odorant molecules. Variation among ORs may be a factor in the coexistence of these sympatric species, facilitating the exploitation of different plant resources. Our study sheds light on how gene duplication and changes in OR diversity may play a role in dietary adaptations and underlie ecological interactions between bats and plants.",

            "abstractNote": "The Honduran white bat, Ectophylla alba (Allen 1982), is one of eight species belonging to the family Phyllos­ tomidae that exclusively roosts in tents. Due to its restricted distribution, habitat specificity, and diet re­ quirements, E. alba has been strongly affected by habitat loss and fragmentation during the last decade. In this study, we developed the first genomic resource for this species; we assembled and analyzed in detail the complete mitochondrial genome of E. alba. The mitogenome of E. alba is 16,664 bp in length and is comprised of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and a putative Control Region (CR) 1,232 bp in length. Gene arrangement in the mitochondrial chromosome of E. alba is identical to that reported before in other species of co-familiar bats. All PCGs are under purifying selection, with atp8 experiencing the least selective pressure. In all PCGs, codons ending with adenine are preferred over others ending in thymine and cytosine. Except tRNA-Serine 1, all tRNAs exhibit a cloverleaf secondary structure. The CR of E. alba exhibits three domains commonly described in other mammals, including bats; extended terminal associated sequences (ETAS), central, and conserved sequence block (CSB). A ML phylogenetic reconstruction of the family Phyllos­ tomidae based on all 13 mitochondrial PCGs confirms the monophyletic status of the subfamily Sternoderma­ tinae and indicates the close relationship between E. alba and the genus Artibeus. This is the first genomic resource developed for E. alba and represents the first step to improving our understanding of the genomic underpinnings involved in the evolution of specialization as well as acclimatization and adaptation to local and global change of specialist bats.",

However, information on how teeth perform under natural conditions is rare, which limits the understanding of how dental morphology influences dietary ecology and niche partitioning within animal communities.\n                \n                \n                  Free‐tailed bats (Chiroptera: Molossidae) are a diverse clade of aerial insectivorous mammals that exhibit an outstanding variation in size and craniodental traits, which have been directly related to ecological segregation among sympatric species.\n                \n                \n                  We investigate the mechanisms that allow functional dietary specialization and trophic segregation among sympatric free‐tailed bat species inhabiting a Neotropical forest. To do so, we coupled data on 3D dental topographic metrics, head and skull dimensions, field‐collected feeding performance and dietary hardness measurements.\n                \n                \n                  We found that evolved differences in molar topography and skull size vary in tandem with the mechanical demands of prey items naturally consumed by sympatric molossid species. This may be explained by feeding performance capabilities resulting from both molar shape and the overall size of the feeding apparatus, which seem to allow efficient processing of prey items with specific mechanical properties. For instance, smaller bats with higher molar topographic values (sharper, more complex molars) and more gracile heads mainly feed on softer insects, whereas bigger bats with lower molar topographic values (blunter, less complex molars) and more robust heads mostly feed on tougher insects. Species with a broader range of sizes, craniodental morphologies and insect hardness are also present in the community.\n                \n                \n                  These results illustrate how the morphology and size of feeding structures, and how they perform, may facilitate trophic segregation among sympatric insectivorous bats. Similar mechanisms may help structure other communities of insectivorous mammals, therefore the approaches presented here could be used to generate a better understanding of the ecomorphological traits and processes that underlie their diversity.\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Read the free\n              Plain Language Summary\n              for this article on the Journal blog.\n            \n          , \n            Resumen\n            \n              \n                \n                  Estudios sobre función y forma han establecido una fuerte relación entre la morfología dental y las propiedades mecánicas de los alimentos, con animales que han evolucionado, teóricamente, formas dentales ideales para sus dietas. Sin embargo, es rara la información de como los dientes se desempeñan en condiciones naturales, lo que limita la comprensión de como la morfología dental influye la ecología de la dieta y la repartición de nicho entre las comunidades animales.\n                \n                \n                  Los murciélagos de cola libre (Chiroptera: Molossidae) son un diverso clado de mamíferos insectívoros aéreos que presentan una impresionante variación en tamaño y características craniodentales, lo cual ha sido directamente relacionado con la segregación ecológica entre especies simpátricas.\n                \n                \n                  Nosotros investigamos los mecanismos que facilitan la especialización funcional dietética y la segregación trófica entre murciélagos de cola libre que habitan en simpatría el bosque Neotropical. Para hacerlo, acoplamos datos sobre métricas topográficas dentales de objetos 3D, dimensiones de la cabeza y el cráneo, así como medidas sobre el desempeño alimentario y la dureza de la dieta obtenidas en el campo.\n                \n                \n                  Encontramos que las diferencias que han evolucionado en topografía molar y tamaño del cráneo varían en tándem con las demandas mecánicas de las presas naturalmente consumidas por las especies de molósidos simpátricos. Esto podría ser explicado por las capacidades de desempeño alimentario que resultan de ambos, la forma de los molares y el tamaño total del aparato de alimentación, lo cual parece permitir un procesamiento eficiente de presas con propiedades mecánicas específicas. Por ejemplo, los murciélagos más pequeños con valores más altos de topografía molar (molares más afilados y complejos) y cabezas más finas se alimentan principalmente de insectos más suaves, mientras que los murciélagos más grandes con valores más bajos de topografía molar (molares menos filosos y complejos) y cabezas más robustas se alimentan principalmente de insectos más duros. Las especies con un rango mayor de tamaños, morfologías craniodentales y dureza de los insectos también están presentes en la comunidad.\n                \n                \n                  Estos resultados demuestran como la morfología y el tamaño de las estructuras alimentarias, así como el desempeño de estas, podrían facilitar la segregación trófica entre murciélagos insectívoros que habitan en simpatría. Mecanismos similares podrían ayudar a estructurar otras comunidades de mamíferos insectívoros, por lo tanto, los enfoques presentados podrían ser utilizados para entender mejor las características ecomorfológicas y los procesos que subyacen esta diversidad.",
