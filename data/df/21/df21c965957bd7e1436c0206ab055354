            "abstractNote": "The Messel Pit Fossil Site (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) is located within the Sprendlingen Horst (SW Germany), a basement unit forming the northeastern shoulder of the Upper Rhine graben. The Messel Pit is interpreted as an isolated lake sediment occurrence created by phreatomagmatic activity. 4OAr/39Ar dating with stepwise heating via laser on a redeposited basalt fragment within a lapilli tuff recovered by the Messel research drilling of2001 yields a plateau age of 47.8 ± 0. 2 Ma (Middle Eocene). This age correlates with a major phase of volcanic activity in the Sprendlingen Horst during the short time span from 49 to 47 Ma. The 4OAr/39Ar date enables a numerical calibration of the Messel lake sedimentation. The contemporaneously deposited taphocoenosis corresponds to the marnmalian biostratigraphic reference level Mammal Paleogene MP 11. For phreatomagmatic activity associated with the maar crater collapse and contemporaneous onset of lake sedimentation, an age of 48 Ma might be derived. Frequency analyses along with sedimentol ogical criteria point to a subsequent phase of sedimentation lasting approximately 1 Ma. The age of the fossils excavated thus far from the uppermost part of the Messel sediments could thus be 47 Ma. Correspondingly, an estimate for the MP II time interval is 47.5 to 46.5 Ma. Since MP II represents the base ofEuropean Land Mammal Age (ELMA) Geiseltalian, the boundary with the older ELMA Grauvian can be estimated at 47.5 Ma.",

Very-high-resolution satellite imagery has been successfully used to detect and count a number of wildlife species in open, homogeneous landscapes and seascapes where target animals have a strong contrast with their environment. However, no research to date has detected animals in complex heterogeneous environments or detected elephants from space using very-high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning. In this study, we apply a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically detect and count African elephants in a woodland savanna ecosystem in South Africa. We use WorldView-3 and 4 satellite data –the highest resolution satellite imagery commercially available. We train and test the model on 11 images from 2014 to 2019. We compare the performance accuracy of the CNN against human accuracy. Additionally, we apply the model on a coarser resolution satellite image (GeoEye-1) captured in Kenya, without any additional training data, to test if the algorithm can generalize to an elephant population outside of the training area. Our results show that the CNN performs with high accuracy, comparable to human detection capabilities. The detection accuracy (i.e., F2 score) of the CNN models was 0.78 in heterogeneous areas and 0.73 in homogenous areas. This compares with the detection accuracy of the human labels with an averaged F2 score 0.77 in heterogeneous areas and 0.80 in homogenous areas. The CNN model can generalize to detect elephants in a different geographical location and from a lower resolution satellite. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of applying state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing and deep learning technologies for detecting and counting African elephants in heterogeneous landscapes. The study showcases the feasibility of using high resolution satellite imagery as a promising new wildlife surveying technique. Through creation of a customized training dataset and application of a Convolutional Neural Network, we have automated the detection of elephants in satellite imagery with accuracy as high as human detection capabilities. The success of the model to detect elephants outside of the training data site demonstrates the generalizability of the technique.",

            "abstractNote": "Abandoned mines now serve as important year-round sanctuaries for bats. Many of North America’s largest remaining bat populations roost in mines. These include more than half of the continent's 45 bat species and some of the largest populations of endangered bats. Bats have lost countless traditional roosts in caves and old tree hollows and many have gradually moved into abandoned mines, which can provide similar environments. Mine closures without first surveying for bats can have potentially serious ecological and economic consequences. Bats are primary predators of night-flying insects, and many such insects rank among North America’s most costly agricultural and forest pests. These include cucumber, potato, and snout beetles; corn-earworm, cotton-bollworm, and grain moths; leafhoppers; and mosquitoes. A single little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) can catch more than 1,200 mosquito-sized insects in an hour. A mine roosting colony of just 150 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) can eat sufficient cucumber beetles each summer to protect farmers from 33 million of these beetles’ root worm larvae, pests that cost American farmers an estimated billion dollars annually. And a colony of Mexican freetailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) living in the old Orient Mine consumes nearly two tons of insects nightly, largely crop-consuming moths. In the western states, pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) benefit ranchers by consuming large quantities of grasshoppers and crickets. Lesser and greater long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris curasoae and L. nivalis) and long-tongued bats (Choeronycteris mexicana) are believed to be important pollinators for some 60 species of agave plants and serve as both pollinators and seed dispersers for dozens of species of columnar cacti, including organ pipe and saguaro, which rank among the southwestern deserts’ most familiar and ecologically important plants. Despite their critical role in our environment and economy, available evidence suggests that millions of bats have already been lost during abandoned mine safety closures or renewed mining in historic districts. These actions could endanger even currently abundant species, forcing the need for Federal listing at considerable taxpayer expense. The loss of bats can increase our reliance on chemical pesticides (which often threaten both environmental and human health), jeopardize whole ecosystems of other plants and animals, and harm human economies. The cost of surveying and protecting key mine roosts is small compared to the benefits provided by these valuable night-flying allies.",

Here, we analyse 100 time-series from biomes across the Earth to ask how diversity within assemblages is changing through time. We quantified patterns of temporal α diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal β diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we do not detect systematic loss of α diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal α and β diversity. Monitoring and understanding change in species composition should be a conservation priority.",

Hickmania troglodytes is a prominent member of the Tasmanian cave fauna, a spider of phylogenetic, zoogeographic and ecological importance, but about which little has previously been known. Long-term monitoring has revealed many unusual life-cycle characteristics in this species, most of which occur over long periods of time and are dependent upon environmental stability. The species presents a potentially useful tool in the management and monitoring of cave fauna and karst, as it is large, conspicuous, numerous, ubiquitous, sedentary, functionally significant and potentially sensitive to various sources of disturbance. H. troglodytes may provide a visible and obvious measure of disturbance in and around cave entrances, and may also prove useful in detecting broader scale impacts affecting the entire cave. Many promising developments are being made in terms of cave management in Tasmania, but other issues are less well addressed and still need to be resolved. With further research, the use of indicator or sentinel species may prove to be well suited to the less complex and often sparsely populated subterranean environment, and may play an important role within larger management strategies for cave fauna and karst.",

            "abstractNote": "Precise estimates of population dynamics and social grouping patterns are required for effective conservation of wild animal populations. It is difficult to obtain such information on non-human great apes as they have slow reproductive rates. To gain a better understanding of demography in these populations, previous research has typically involved habituation\\, a process that requires years. Here, we collected data continuously over year-long periods to monitor an unhabituated population of critically endangered Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Moyen Bafing National Park, Guinea. We used two arrays of 100 camera traps that were placed opportunistically in two distinct 100 km2 sites, named Bakoun and Koukoutamba. We identified 227 individuals in Bakoun and 207 in Koukoutamba through their unique facial features. Our camera trap data make clear that these individuals belong to six and seven closed groups, respectively. Six of those groups were near-completely sampled with an average minimum size of 46.8 individuals (range: 37–58), and a mean adult sex ratio of 1.32 (range: 0.93–2.10). We described the demographic composition of these groups and use Bayesian social network analysis to understand population structure. The network analyses suggested that the social bonds within the two populations were structured by sex homophily, with male chimpanzees being more or equally likely to be observed together than other adult associations. Through estimation of minimum convex polygons, we described the minimum home range for those groups. Compared to other chimpanzee groups living in a similar environment (mosaic savanna-forest), the Moyen Bafing region seems to host a high-density of chimpanzees with small home ranges for their group size. Our research highlights the potential of camera traps for studying the demographic composition of chimpanzee populations with high resolution and obtaining crucial information on several groups in a time-efficient and cost-effective way.",

            "abstractNote": "The thesis investigates the socio-ecological factors driving human-leopard conflict due to livestock and game depredation in the Blouberg Mountain Range, South Africa. Local people’s perceptions of conservation are shaped by historical and contemporary relationships with protected areas and particularly, by conflicts of land and natural resource use. Legacies of disempowerment, marginalisation and stigmatisation manifest through people’s conservation discourses, social conflict and resistance towards protected area establishment, a process defined as traumatic nature. Traumatic nature elevates distrust of local people towards wildlife authorities and decreases support for wildlife conservation, aggravating humanleopard conflicts. Leopard predation on livestock and game is most strongly influenced by distance to village and distance to water, respectively, in addition to seasonal grazing patterns, the calving season and poor livestock husbandry practices. Livestock depredation represents significant economic costs for subsistence communal farmers’, which is exacerbated by the erosion of traditional cattle sharing systems and a lack of alternative livelihood strategies. Livestock depredation results in the loss of functional and material benefits, social capital, a spiritual resource, diminished wellbeing and perceived cultural decay. Camera trap results showed a lower leopard density of 0.7 leopards per 100km2 on commercial farms compared to the Blouberg Nature Reserve of 5.4 leopards per 100km2. Commercial farms may function as ecological traps because they represent areas with disproportionate leopard mortality that otherwise provide a high abundance of prey species for leopards. A male-biased sex ratio and a high number of sub-adult male leopards indicate high leopard mortality rates in the population. Camera trap results show low occupancy rates on communal land that may reflect a low large prey biomass, potentially caused by overhunting and habitat conversion. Farming communities ascribe a wide range of environmental values to the leopard that provide barriers and support for leopard conservation. Environmental institutions need to improve responses to reports of human-leopard conflicts and build trust and legitimacy in the eyes of local people by developing stronger working relationships with farming communities. The decentralisation of authority to local government actors to manage human-leopard conflicts and the devolution of responsibility to farmers to improve livestock husbandry practices is necessary to reduce depredation incidents. Incentive and education schemes are important for reducing lethal control measures and to improve tolerance of depredation incidents and leopard conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "My thesis addresses three key gaps in urban-ecology research, which lacks sufficient attention to (1) grassland biomes, (2) individual- and population-level effects, and (3) nonavian vertebrates. I hypothesized that in the fairly flat, homogeneous Prairies, the city (Calgary, Alberta) is like a structurally complex island, with increased availability of roosts and prey. Along with the urban heat island, these features of the urban environment would benefit Prairie bats, producing increased bat abundance, diversity and fitness in the city relative to outside. I acoustically monitored bat activity and captured bats in mist nets, and found that although urban bats were more abundant, they were not more diverse. Myotis lucifugus dominated bat assemblages throughout my study area, but nowhere more so than in Calgary. It appears that urbanization in the Prairies may create attractive habitat for one synanthropic species (M. lucifugus) but have the opposite effect for others. I sampled nocturnal insects to assess the potential availability of prey to bats, and acoustically monitored their foraging activity. Contrary to my predictions, neither insect abundance nor insect diversity was maximized in the city, and urban bats did not forage more than non-urban bats did. Thus, increased numbers of M. lucifugus in Calgary do not seem linked to an urban increase in prey availability. I assessed body condition, reproductive rates, spermatogenesis, production of juveniles, post-natal growth and population age structure in M. lucifugus. I found no support for predictions that urban bats have enhanced fitness relative to non-urban conspecifics. Instead, it appears that increased population density in the city may be detrimental to bats, perhaps by increasing intraspecific competition for food. Finally, I assessed the ectoparasite loads of urban and non-urban bats. The effects of urbanization in terms of modulating ectoparasitism were dependent on the bat species, bat group and parasite type, with no consistent pattern. Ultimately, I reject my overall hypothesis. Rather than benefitting Prairie bats, urbanization may be detrimental to them. This may reflect a more general negative effect of increased bat density and/or larger group size in the city.",

As many as 2,604 flying foxes were counted roosting on two Termina/ia cope/andii (Lanipaw) trees. Behavioral units were identified then categorized in an ethogram as general maintenance behavior and social behavior. Activities of bats were sampled using the Instantaneous Sampling Method. Sleeping was the most dominant occurring behavior (80.42%) on the roost. Sleeping positions by flying foxes were probably driven by environmental conditions Jike weather, temperature and sunflecks. Other general maintenance behaviors were grooming (9.88%), locomotion (1.13%) searching (0.29%), stretching (0.33%), urinating (0.40%), defecating (0.43%), flying (2.64%), and fanning (2.25%). Social behaviors showed percent occurrences as: aggression (1.22%), courting (0.87%), and copulating (0.14%). Their roost site is 2 km from human habitation in Malagos. Two T. cope/andii trees were found to be the primary roost trees. Endospermum pe/tatum (gubas) was also used by the flying foxes although less commonly. Both tree species have low canopy cover, and horizontal branching patterns and fissured barks. Flying foxes were not observed roosting on other big trees with high canopy cover and ascending branching patterns.",

            "abstractNote": "Field biology is an area of research that involves working directly with living organisms in situ through a practice known as “fieldwork.” Conducting fieldwork often requires complex logistical planning within multiregional or multinational teams, followed by collaborative research led by one or a few of the core team members. However, existing power imbalances stemming from geopolitical history, discrimination, and professional position perpetuate inequities in the context of these research endeavors. After reflecting on our own research programs, we propose four general principles to guide equitable, inclusive, ethical, and safe practices in field biology: Be Collaborative, Be Legal, Be Safe, and Be Respectful. Although many field biologists already structure their field programs around these principles or similar values, executing equitable research practices can prove challenging and requires careful consideration, especially by those in positions with relatively greater privilege. Based on experiences and input from a diverse group of global collaborators, we provide suggestions for action-oriented approaches to making field biology more equitable under these guidelines, with particular attention to how those with greater privilege can contribute. While we acknowledge that not all suggestions will be applicable to every institution or program, we hope that they will generate discussions and provide a baseline for training in proactive, equitable fieldwork practices.",

The discovery of these shrew-borne hantaviruses, named Ash River virus and Jemez Springs virus, respectively, challenges the long-held dogma that rodents are the sole reservoir hosts and forces a re-examination of their co-evolutionary history. Also, studies now underway are aimed at clarifying the epizootiology and pathogenicity of these new members of the genus Hantavirus.",

            "abstractNote": "The skin microbiome is an essential line of host defense against pathogens, yet our understanding of microbial communities and how they change when hosts become infected is limited. We investigated skin microbial composition in three North American bat species (Myotis lucifugus, Eptesicus fuscus, and Perimyotis subflavus) that have been impacted by the infectious disease, white-nose syndrome, caused by an invasive fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. We compared bacterial and fungal composition from 154 skin swab samples and 70 environmental samples using a targeted 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon approach. We found that for M. lucifugus, a species that experiences high mortality from white-nose syndrome, bacterial microbiome diversity was dramatically lower when P. destructans is present. Key bacterial families—including those potentially involved in pathogen defense—significantly differed in abundance in bats infected with P. destructans compared to uninfected bats. However, skin bacterial diversity was not lower in E. fuscus or P. subflavus when P. destructans was present, despite populations of the latter species declining sharply from white-nose syndrome. The fungal species present on bats substantially overlapped with the fungal taxa present in the environment at the site where the bat was sampled, but fungal community composition was unaffected by the presence of P. destructans for any of the three bat species. This species-specific alteration in bat skin bacterial microbiomes after pathogen invasion may suggest a mechanism for the severity of WNS in M. lucifugus, but not for other bat species impacted by white-nose syndrome.",

However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. We used a Bayesian statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission, and dispersal in China. We find that host-switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha-than beta-CoVs, and more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus\n            Rhinolophus\n            . Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance.
