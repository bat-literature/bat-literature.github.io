Although not yet identiﬁed, bats and rodents may be implicated in RVF virus (RVFV) epidemiology. In this study, we investigated the putative role of Egyptian frugivorous and insectivorous bats in RVFV epidemiology in Egypt.\nMethods: From 2019 to 2021, 200 bats of two different species from six Egyptian governorates were tested for phleboviruses using real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) and sequence analysis.\nResults: Screening through rRT-PCR showed evidence of the RVFV genome only in insectivorous bats. Partial sequence and phylogenetic analysis based on S and M genome segments showed that these viruses are genetically similar to those circulating (clade A) in livestock and humans during previously reported RVFV outbreaks in 1977/78 and 2003 in Egypt.\nConclusions: Our molecular data suggest that the bat Pipistrellus deserti could play a role in RVFV ecology in Egypt.",

            "abstractNote": "The loss of previously adaptive traits is typically linked to relaxation in selection, yet the molecular steps leading to such repeated losses are rarely known. Molecular studies of loss have tended to focus on gene sequences alone, but overlooking other aspects of protein expression might underestimate phenotypic diversity. Insights based almost solely on opsin gene evolution, for instance, have made mammalian color vision a textbook example of phenotypic loss. We address this gap by investigating retention and loss of opsin genes, transcripts, and proteins across ecologically diverse noctilionoid bats. We find multiple, independent losses of short-wave-sensitive opsins. Mismatches between putatively functional DNA sequences, mRNA transcripts, and proteins implicate transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in the ongoing loss of S-opsins in some noctilionoid bats. Our results provide a snapshot of evolution in progress during phenotypic trait loss, and suggest vertebrate visual phenotypes cannot always be predicted from genotypes alone.\n          , \n            Bats are famous for using their hearing to explore their environments, yet fewer people are aware that these flying mammals have both good night and daylight vision. Some bats can even see in color thanks to two light-sensitive proteins at the back of their eyes: S-opsin which detects blue and ultraviolet light and L-opsin which detects green and red light. Many species of bat, however, are missing one of these proteins and cannot distinguish any colors; in other words, they are completely color-blind.\n            Some bat species found in Central and South America have independently lost their ability to see blue-ultraviolet light and have thus also lost their color vision. These bats have diverse diets – ranging from insects to fruits and even blood – and being able to distinguish color may offer an advantage in many of their activities, including hunting or foraging. The vision genes in these bats, therefore, give scientists an opportunity to explore how a seemingly important trait can be lost at the molecular level.\n            Sadier, Davies et al. now report that S-opsin has been lost more than a dozen times during the evolutionary history of these Central and South American bats. The analysis used samples from 55 species, including animals caught from the wild and specimens from museums. As with other proteins, the instructions encoded in the gene sequence for S opsin need to be copied into a molecule of RNA before they can be translated into protein. As expected, S-opsin was lost several times because of changes in the gene sequence that disrupted the formation of the protein. However, at several points in these bats’ evolutionary history, additional changes have taken place that affected the production of the RNA or the protein, without an obvious change to the gene itself. This finding suggests that other studies that rely purely on DNA to understand evolution may underestimate how often traits may be lost. By capturing ‘evolution in action’, these results also provide a more complete picture of the molecular targets of evolution in a diverse set of bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The recent pandemic and other environmental concerns have resulted in restrictions on research and surveys involving capture and handling bats. While acoustic surveys have been widely used as an alternative survey method, in this study, we show how photographic surveys can offer an important contribution to study and survey bats. We outline approaches, using high speed flash and automated trip beams to obtain photos of flying bats of sufficient quality for reliable identification of species. We show, through a series of examples of setups and photographs, that photography is effective for surveying bats at a variety of sites, where bats roost, drink, and forage. We note, however, that photographic surveys cannot replace capture in all situations. In addition, although photographing bats is less invasive than capturing them, it can involve disturbance, so we stress the importance of minimizing the impact of such operations on bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The phenology of flowering and fruiting of trees was studied from June 1980 to the end of March 1982 in the lowland rain forest of Piste Saint Elie, French Guiana. All flowering and fruiting trees over 2 cm DBH overhanging a trail 1000 to 1500 m long and 1 m wide were noted every second week, and all flowers and fruits which fell on the trail were collected and weighed. The following results were obtained :\n            Fertility was always low, less than 50 % of the trees over 45 cm DBH bearing fruit during the two yearly cycles. Fertility also varied from one year to the next, being higher during the second yearly cycle. However, some trees which flowered normally never bore fruit.\n            Most tree species (from 76 to 80 %, depending on the year) flowered during the «dry» season and bore fruit during the rainy season (86 to 88 %). The seeds of most of the species (56 %) germinated in less than one month in experimental conditions, and 22,2 % in more than 4 months.\n            Seasonality in reproduction occured in all species of dicotyledonous trees, whatever their size or age (from 2 to > 60 cm DBH). It was far less marked in understorey trees, epiphytes and woody lianas. Seasonality in fruiting was particularly marked among species bearing fleshy fruits disseminated by animals, although some were produced at any time of the year. Seasonality was also marked among wind-dispersed and autochorous tree species. Among trees bearing fleshy fruits, those with the larger seeds were much more seasonal than those with smaller seeds. Finally, the species which were moderately abundant on the sampling transect were more seasonal than both the scarcer and the most abundant ones. Mast fruiting was observed in 8 species of Eschweilera and Lecythis (Lecythidaceae). In the rain forest studied, the fruiting peak mostly results, at the species level, from the adjustment of the maturation period to the flowering time.\n            Biotic factors undoubtedly play an important role in determining fruiting peaks at the community level.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract Bats are incredibly diverse, both morphologically and taxonomically. Bats are the only mammalian group to have achieved powered flight, an adaptation that is hypothesized to have allowed them to colonize various and diverse ecological niches. However, the lack of fossils capturing the transition from terrestrial mammal to volant chiropteran has obscured much of our understanding of bat evolution. Over the last 20 years, the emergence of evo-devo in non-model species has started to fill this gap by uncovering some developmental mechanisms at the origin of bat diversification. In this review, we highlight key aspects of studies that have used bats as a model for morphological adaptations, diversification during adaptive radiations, and morphological novelty. To do so, we review current and ongoing studies on bat evolution. We first investigate morphological specialization by reviewing current knowledge about wing and face evolution. Then, we explore the mechanisms behind adaptive diversification in various ecological contexts using vision and dentition. Finally, we highlight the emerging work into morphological novelties using bat wing membranes.",

            "abstractNote": "A majority of viruses that have caused recent epidemics with high lethality rates in people, are zoonoses originating from wildlife. Among them are filoviruses (eg. Marburg, Ebola), coronaviruses (eg. SARS, MERS), henipaviruses (eg. Hendra, Nipah) which share the common features that they are all RNA viruses, and that a dysregulated immune response is an important contributor to the tissue damage and hence pathogenicity that results from infection in humans. Intriguingly, these viruses also all originate from bat reservoirs. Bats have been shown to have a greater mean viral richness than predicted by their phylogenetic distance from humans, their geographic range, or their presence in urban areas, suggesting other traits must explain why bats harbour a greater number of zoonotic viruses than other mammals. Bats are highly unusual among mammals in other ways as well. Not only are they the only mammals capable of powered flight, they have extraordinarily long life spans, with little detectable increases in mortality or senescence until high ages. Their physiology likely impacted their history of pathogen exposure and necessitated adaptations that may have also affected immune signalling pathways. Do our life history traits make us susceptible to generating damaging immune responses to RNA viruses or does the physiology of bats make them particularly tolerant or resistant? Understanding what immune mechanisms enable bats to coexist with RNA viruses may provide critical fundamental insights into how to achieve greater resilience in humans.",

            "abstractNote": "Recently diverged taxa are often characterised by high rates of introgressive hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting, both of which can complicate phylogenetic reconstructions of species histories. Here we use a sequence capture approach to obtain genome-wide data to resolve the evolutionary relationships, and infer the extent and timescale of hybridization and introgression events, among six recently diverged taxa of the horseshoe bat species complexes Rhinolophus sinicus and R. thomasi. We show that two diﬀerent methods of species tree reconstruction applied to a set of ~1500 nuclear loci all recover species trees with similar topologies, diﬀering from the previous phylogeny based on two nuclear loci. By comparing the tree topology obtained from the nuclear loci with that inferred from the mitochondrial genome, we observed at least three cases of conﬂict, each of which likely results from past introgression. Of these, the occurrence of a highly similar mitogenome sequence shared by individuals of two taxa in a sympatric region points to very recent mtDNA introgression. The other cases are characterised by greater divergence and strong phylogeographic structure among putative introgressed individuals and their source populations, and thus likely reﬂect more ancient hybridization events. These results also suggest that two of the subspecies (R. s. septentrionalis and the undescribed taxon R. s. ssp) are likely to represent full species, warranting full taxonomic descriptions. This work adds a growing number of studies showing the potential problems of relying solely on mitochondrial sequences, or a limited number of loci, to infer phylogenetic relationships among recently diverged taxa.",

In contrast, populations of the reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens often appear to tolerate these infections with little evidence of disease. Why are viruses more dangerous in one species than another? Immunological studies investigating quantitative and qualitative differences in the host-virus equilibrium in animal reservoirs will be key to answering this question, informing new approaches for treating and preventing zoonotic diseases. Integrating an understanding of host immune responses with epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary insights into viral emergence will shed light on mechanisms that minimize fitness costs associated with viral infection, facilitate transmission to other hosts, and underlie the association of specific reservoir hosts with multiple emerging viruses. Reservoir host studies provide a rich opportunity for elucidating fundamental immunological processes and their underlying genetic basis, in the context of distinct physiological and metabolic constraints that contribute to host resistance and disease tolerance.",

Phyllonycteris is endemic to the Greater Antilles and P. poeyi is endemic to Cuba and Hispaniola. P. poeyi is characterized by a rudimentary nose leaf, median groove on lower lip ridged with papillae, and ears that are moderately large and separate. P. poeyi shows marked sexual dimorphism in size, with males being larger than females in some cranial and body dimensions. It is a gregarious and obligate cave dweller that usually inhabits the innermost parts of blind galleries. P. poeyi has been captured in evergreen forest, secondary forest, and ravines. P. poeyi is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.",

            "abstractNote": "The ability to extract pollen contents may be related to the extent to which animals use this item as a regular part of their diet. In spite of the broad diversity of taxa that feed on pollen, comparative studies to test this hypothesis are scarce. We compared the extraction efﬁciency of pollen grains of Blue Mahoe (Talipariti elatum) by Antillean nectar bats (Brachyphylla nana) and Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis). Antillean nectar bats extracted the contents of a higher percentage of pollen grains than Jamaican fruit bats, even though processing time in the gut was lower in the nectarivorous bats. Pollen extraction efﬁciency increased with time spent in the gut in each species. The gastrointestinal tract in both species resembled the functioning of a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) equivalent to the stomach, in series with a plug-ﬂow reactor (PFR) equivalent to the intestine with varying degrees of longitudinal mixing. Accordingly, pollen grains ﬂowed continuously out of the stomach and moved out through the intestine where they were mixed longitudinally. Our results support previous ﬁndings of higher extraction efﬁciencies in nectarivorous bats than their frugivorous relatives, and suggest that these differences may be the result of differences in the level of activity of the enzymes responsible for pollen wall degradation. Identiﬁcation of enzymatic mechanisms of pollen degradation would allow a direct test of this hypothesis.",

In Brazil, records are mainly concentrated in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes, although there are scattered occurrences in the Pantanal, Caatinga, and Amazonian biomes. In this study, we report the first occurrence of M. bennettii in the Amazonas State, Brazil. We compare these Amazonian specimens to a sample from the Atlantic Forest and discuss morphological differences. This record extends the Brazilian distribution westward by 1350 km. Amazonas is now the richest Brazilian state, with 128 bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Little research on coronaviruses has been conducted on wild animals in Africa. Here, we screened a wide range of wild animals collected in six provinces and five caves of Gabon between 2009 and 2015. We collected a total of 1867 animal samples (cave-dwelling bats, rodents, non-human primates and other wild animals). We explored the diversity of CoVs and determined the factors driving the infection of CoVs in wild animals. Based on a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, only bats, belonging to the Hipposideros gigas (4/156), Hipposideros cf. ruber (13/262) and Miniopterus inflatus (1/249) species, were found infected with CoVs. We identified alphacoronaviruses in H. gigas and H. cf. ruber and betacoronaviruses in H. gigas. All Alphacoronavirus sequences grouped with Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Ecological analyses revealed that CoV infection was significantly found in July and October in H. gigas and in October and November in H. cf ruber. The prevalence in the Faucon cave was significantly higher. Our findings suggest that insectivorous bats harbor potentially zoonotic CoVs; highlight a probable seasonality of the infection in cave-dwelling bats from the North-East of Gabon and pointed to an association between the disturbance of the bats’ habitat by human activities and CoV infection.",

            "abstractNote": "The rising incidence of emerging infectious diseases (EID) is mostly linked to biodiversity loss, changes in habitat use and increasing habitat fragmentation. Bats are linked to a growing number of EID but few studies have explored the factors of viral richness in bats. These may have implications for role of bats as potential reservoirs. We investigated the determinants of viral richness in 15 species of African bats (8 Pteropodidae and 7 microchiroptera) in Central and West Africa for which we provide new information on virus infection and bat phylogeny. We performed the first comparative analysis testing the correlation of the fragmented geographical distribution (defined as the perimeter to area ratio) with viral richness in bats. Because of their potential effect, sampling effort, host body weight, ecological and behavioural traits such as roosting behaviour, migration and geographical range, were included into the analysis as variables. The results showed that the geographical distribution size, shape and host body weight have significant effects on viral richness in bats. Viral richness was higher in large-bodied bats which had larger and more fragmented distribution areas. Accumulation of viruses may be related to the historical expansion and contraction of bat species distribution range, with potentially strong effects of distribution edges on virus transmission. Two potential explanations may explain these results. A positive distribution edge effect on the abundance or distribution of some bat species could have facilitated host switches. Alternatively, parasitism could play a direct role in shaping the distribution range of hosts through host local extinction by virulent parasites. This study highlights the importance of considering the fragmentation of bat species geographical distribution in order to understand their role in the circulation of viruses in Africa.",

This herb colonizes disturbed swampy sites in clearings and forest edges, blooming year-round. Its greenish white flowers open at dusk and attract phyllostomid bats and hawkmoths. The long-tongued bat Glossophaga soricina is the major pollinator of I. alata at the study site, with its trapline visits promoting crosspollination of this herb. The small flowers and the delicate stem of L alata match the small size and the manoeuverable flight of glossophagine bats.",

Change in colouration was recorded in January when 62% of A. jamaicensis captured (n=50) appeared yellow. All faecal samples collected from atypically coloured individuals consisted mainly of Ceiba pentandra pollen, which was also recovered from the fur. Carotenoid pigments contained in pollen ingested during peak Ceiba flowering appear to be incorporated into the hairs of A. jamaicensis. Further investigations are required to understand how pigment is transferred between the pollen and the hairs of A. jamaicensis.",

            "abstractNote": "Taxonomy and species conservation are often assumed to be completely interdependent activities. However, a shortage of taxonomic information and skills, and confusion over where the limits to ‘species’ should be set, both cause problems for conservationists. There is no simple solution because species lists used for conservation planning (e.g. threatened species, species richness estimates, species covered by legislation) are often also used to determine which units should be the focus of conservation actions; this despite the fact that the two processes have such different goals and information needs. Species conservation needs two kinds of taxonomic solution: (i) a set of practical rules to standardize the species units included on lists; and (ii) an approach to the units chosen for conservation recovery planning which recognizes the dynamic nature of natural systems and the differences from the units in listing processes that result. These solutions are well within our grasp but require a new kind of collaboration among conservation biologists, taxonomists and legislators, as well as an increased resource of taxonomists with relevant and high–quality skills.",

Although at a global level, such persecution is relatively uncommon, even a few misguided actions have the potential to cause irrevocable damage to already vulnerable species. Here, we draw on the latest findings from psychology, to explain why some conservation messaging may be reinforcing misleading negative associations. We provide guidelines to help ensure that conservation messaging is working to neutralize dangerous and unwarranted negative-associations between bats and disease-risk. We provide recommendations around three key areas of psychological science: (i) debunking misinformation; (ii) counteracting negative associations; and (iii) changing harmful social norms. We argue that only by carefully framing accurate, honest, and duly contextualized information, will we be able to best serve society and present an unbiased perspective of bats. We hope this guidance will help conservation practitioners and researchers to develop effective message framing strategies that minimize zoonotic health risks and support biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services.",

            "abstractNote": "Blood analyses have great potential in studies of ecology, ecotoxicology and veterinary science in wild vertebrates based on advances in human and domestic animal medicine. The major caveat for field researchers, however, is that the 'rules' for human or domestic animal haematology do not always apply to wildlife. The present overview shows the strengths and limitations of blood analyses in wild vertebrates, and proposes a standardisation of pre-analytical procedures plus some suggestions for a more systematic examination of blood smears to increase the diagnostic value of blood data. By discussing the common problems that field researchers face with blood variables, we also aim to highlight common ground enabling new researchers in the field to accurately collect blood samples and interpret and place their haematological findings into the overall picture of an ecological or eco-toxicological study. Besides showing the practicality and ecological relevance of simple blood variables, this study illustrates the suitability of blood samples for the application of cutting-edge analytical procedures for expanding the current repertoire of diagnostic tools in wildlife monitoring and ecosystem health assessment.",

Despite the ecological and economic importance of bats and birds in tropical forests, agroforestry systems, and agricultural systems mixed with natural forest, a systematic review of their impact is still missing. A growing number of bird and bat exclosure experiments has improved our knowledge allowing new conclusions regarding their roles in food webs and associated ecosystem services. Here, we review the distribution patterns of insectivorous birds and bats, their local and landscape drivers, and their effects on trophic cascades in tropical ecosystems. We report that for birds but not bats community composition and relative importance of functional groups changes conspicuously from forests to habitats including both agricultural areas and forests, here termed ‘forest‐agri’ habitats, with reduced representation of insectivores in the latter. In contrast to previous theory regarding trophic cascade strength, we find that birds and bats reduce the density and biomass of arthropods in the tropics with effect sizes similar to those in temperate and boreal communities. The relative importance of birds\n              versus\n              bats in regulating pest abundances varies with season, geography and management. Birds and bats may even suppress tropical arthropod outbreaks, although positive effects on plant growth are not always reported. As both bats and birds are major agents of pest suppression, a better understanding of the local and landscape factors driving the variability of their impact is needed.",

Data were analyzed temporally and geographically to assess trends in domestic animal and wildlife rabies cases.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              During 2018, 54 jurisdictions reported 4,951 rabid animals to the CDC, representing an 11.2% increase from the 4,454 rabid animals reported in 2017. Texas (n = 695 [14.0%]), Virginia (382 [7.7%]), Pennsylvania (356 [7.2%]), North Carolina (332 [6.7%]), Colorado (328 [6.6%]), and New York (320 [6.5%]) together accounted for almost half of all rabid animals reported in 2018. Of the total reported rabies cases, 4,589 (92.7%) involved wildlife, with bats (n = 1,635 [33.0%]), raccoons (1,499 [30.3%]), skunks (1,004 [20.3%]), and foxes (357 [7.2%]) being the major species. Rabid cats (n = 241 [4.9%]) and dogs (63 [1.3%]) accounted for > 80% of rabid domestic animals reported in 2018. There was a 4.6% increase in the number of samples submitted for testing in 2018, compared with the number submitted in 2017. Three human rabies deaths were reported in 2018, compared with 2 in 2017.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE\n              The overall number of animal rabies cases increased from 2017 to 2018. Laboratory diagnosis of rabies in animals is critical to ensure that human rabies postexposure prophylaxis is administered judiciously.",

Scales from at least three species of small ﬁsh were found in the droppings, together with fragments of insects from six orders. This study demonstrates that M. ricketti is a ﬁsh-eating bat. As with other trawling bats in the genus Myotis, M. ricketti emits short, broadband echolocation sounds. The sounds recorded from bats released from the hand swept downward from c. 70 to 28 kHz in 4 ms, and contained most energy at 41 kHz.",

By examining an extensive data set covering a period of 2 years, the present study identifies the dietary composition of three sympatric insectivorous bat species in rural areas of Beijing municipality. Each species clearly has different preferences for particular food items. Greater horseshoe bats,\n              Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\n              , preferred to catch nocturnal, actively flying insects, mostly moths (Lepidoptera), and to a lesser percentage flies (Diptera), beetles (Coleoptera), and flying ants and termites (Hymenoptera). Other nocturnal insects which do not exhibit any perceptible wing movements, such as true bugs (Homoptera), or strictly diurnal insects that hardly ever fly in the dark, such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera) and dragon‐ and damselflies (Odonata), were never found in droppings of horseshoe bats. Large mouse‐eared bats,\n              Myotis chinensis\n              , preferentially glean relatively large terrestrial prey of the order Coleoptera (mostly carabid beetles) and Orthoptera, whereas greater tube‐nosed bats,\n              Murina leucogaster\n              , consume predominantly smaller, diurnal Coleoptera (mostly soldier beetles, Cantharidae, and ladybugs, Coccinellidae). Our findings also indicate previously not described, significant spectro‐temporal differences in the echolocation signals of\n              M. chinensis\n              and\n              M. leucogaster\n              . The results suggest that in our study area the dramatic differences in the dietary composition of these three bat species are mainly based upon differences in their foraging behaviors, including differences in their echolocation signal structure. The dietary data provide important background information for conservational efforts, such as habitat protection.",

An insectivorous species (Pteronotusparnelliu)was also included for comparison. We found constant patterns in stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition in blood that separatedthe two species of frugivorousbats from the insectivorous bat. When we used these isotopic values (combined with those of dietary fruits and insects) to estimate the percent contribution of fruits and insects to the diet of the bats, we obtained different results, depending on assumptions and model adopted. We tested models using both b15N and 813C results simultaneously and separately and further used diet-tissue fractionation factorsof 3%0for nitrogen and 1 and 3.5%o for carbon. We found that a carbonbased model with a diet-blood enrichment factor of 3.5%o produced the most parsimonious results. The model estimated that A. jamaicensisand S. lilium obtained most of their protein requirementsfrom fruits, whereas P.parnellii fed mostly on insects. No sexual or seasonal variations in the diet of the two frugivorous species were detected. We found no evidence that the diet of sexually active females differed from that of nonsexually active females in the two species of frugivorous bats. We suggest that future studies better define isotopic fractionation between diet and tissues of bats using captive rearing and controlled diets.",

            "abstractNote": "This study characterised muscle fibres in trunk, forelimb and hindlimb muscles of three bat species: little Japanese horseshoe (Rhinolophus cornutus), greater horseshoe (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and Egyptian fruit (Rousettus aegyptiacus). Twenty-­seven muscles from trunk, forelimb and hindlimb were dissected, weighed and analysed by immunohistochemistry and sodium didecyl sulphate-­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-­PAGE) and determined their cross-­sectional areas (CSA). Results showed that Type IIa and Type IIa/x made the highest proportion of total muscle mass. Moderate proportion was formed by Type IIb. Type I and IIx appeared at very low levels in all bats. Type IIb was the only fibre type detected in patagial muscles in wing membrane of greater horseshoe while other fibre types were not observed. Type I muscle fibres were very few and appeared infrequently in fifteen muscles of Egyptian fruit and in only one muscle in each, greater horseshoe and little Japanese horseshoe. Type IIx was also detected in three muscles in greater horseshoe and only one muscle in Egyptian fruit but none in little Japanese horseshoe. The highest average CSA μm2 was detected in Type IIb and values were 734.2μm2 for LHB; 1537.9μm2 for GHB and 1,720.9μm2 for EFB. Lowest and undetermined values were observed for Type I and IIx. These data demonstrate that Type IIa, IIa/x and IIb form significant proportion of adult bat muscle mass and Type IIb is the largest fibre type. The distribution pattern is suggestive of specialised functions of the fibres in relation to orientation and speed of bats during flight.",

Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to estimate bat richness in the restinga of Praia das Neves (state of Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil) and to analyze species abundance. Ten sampling nights were carried out in May and July 2008, resulting in a sampling effort of 21,847.5 h.m2. We captured 125 individuals from 17 bat species. In this study, Tonatia saurophila was recorded for the first time not only in the state of Espírito Santo but also in the restinga ecosystem. The most abundant species was Artibeus lituratus with 32% of all captures. Surveys in coastal restingas are urgently needed in order to obtain more information about the bats living in this environment.",

            "abstractNote": "Phylogenies of parasites provide hypotheses on the history of their movements between hosts, leading to important insights regarding the processes of host switching that underlie modern-day epidemics. Haemosporidian (malaria) parasites lack a well resolved phylogeny, which has impeded the study of evolutionary processes associated with host-switching in this group. Here we present a novel phylogenetic hypothesis that suggests bats served as the ancestral hosts of malaria parasites in primates and rodents. Expanding upon current taxon sampling of Afrotropical bat and bird parasites, we ﬁnd strong support for all major nodes in the haemosporidian tree using both Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Our analyses support a single transition of haemosporidian parasites from saurian to chiropteran hosts, and do not support a monophyletic relationship between Plasmodium parasites of birds and mammals. We ﬁnd, for the ﬁrst time, that Hepatocystis and Plasmodium parasites of mammals represent reciprocally monophyletic evolutionary lineages. These results highlight the importance of broad taxonomic sampling when analyzing phylogenetic relationships, and have important implications for our understanding of key host switching events in the history of malaria parasite evolution.",

The habitat mosaic is formed by 4.3 percent tropical dry forest and 3.3 percent farmland, leaving exotic grasslands and stands of Leucaena leucocephala to overrun the vast majority of land. Pteropus tonganus abundance was high (5757 bats) despite deforestation and hunting. Roosting sites were restricted to native forest fragments. Grasslands and stands of L. leucocephala were completely void of bats at all times. The mean foraging density in farmland was four times higher than in forests and foraging competition was routinely observed in farmland but was extremely rare in forests. The author suggests that during the study, extensive foraging in farmland was supporting the high P. tonganus population. Additionally, the preferential foraging in farmland was responsible for the low foraging densities within forests and dramatically less intraspecies competition for forest resources. Further research is needed on seed dispersal within forests and to test for seasonal variations in bat abundance and feeding.",

Within Asia, Eyndhovenia was only recorded from two countries, China and Thailand. Between 2018 and 2020, we conducted a series of bats surveys and recorded of this genus from intermediate horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus affinis, in Vietnam. The present study exhibits the new record in both parasitological and geographical aspects.",

            "abstractNote": "Previous studies indicated that fruit bats carry two betacoronaviruses, BatCoV HKU9 and BatCoV GCCDC1. To investigate the epidemiology and genetic diversity of these coronaviruses, we conducted a longitudinal surveillance in fruit bats in Yunnan province, China during 2009-2016. A total of 59 (10.63%) bat samples were positive for the two betacorona-viruses, 46 (8.29%) for HKU9 and 13 (2.34%) for GCCDC1, or closely related viruses. We identified a novel HKU9 strain, tentatively designated as BatCoV HKU9-2202, by sequencing the full-length genome. The BatCoV HKU9-2202 shared 83% nucleotide identity with other BatCoV HKU9 stains based on whole genome sequences. The most divergent region is in the spike protein, which only shares 68% amino acid identity with BatCoV HKU9. Quantitative PCR revealed that the intestine was the primary infection organ of BatCoV HKU9 and GCCDC1, but some HKU9 was also detected in the heart, kidney, and lung tissues of bats. This study highlights the importance of virus surveillance in natural reservoirs and emphasizes the need for preparedness against the potential spill-over of these viruses to local residents living near bat caves.",

            "abstractNote": "Subterranean environments are essential for the survival of many bat species and other cave fauna but these places are subject to increasing human disturbance. To examine the signiﬁcance of subterranean habitats for the conservation of bats in China we surveyed bat species in 225 underground sites during 2003–2011. Our results show that 77% of bat species in China, including 30 nationally Endangered or Vulnerable species and nine endemic species, roost in caves and other subterranean habitats. The number of species in occupied roosts was 1–15. Almost 90% of the roosts surveyed contained signs of human disturbance, most of which was from recreational activities. One hundred and twenty-one roosts merit special concern because they harbour $ 6 species or . 1,000 individuals, or species of special concern (threatened or endemic species). Generally, larger roosts support more species and a greater abundance of bats than smaller roosts but there is no direct correlation between the presence of species of special concern and roost size. Disused tourist caves have signiﬁcantly more bat species than other types of roosts. Our data demonstrate that roost disturbance by recreational activities has pronounced detrimental eﬀects on the number of bat species and the presence of species of special concern. We discuss the social, economic and political issues that could adversely aﬀect bat conservation in caves in China, and we recommend that protection of subterranean habitats should be a high priority for bat conservation.",

These bats have long, wide auricles, each with a prominent tragus. The length of each auricle is about the same as that of a forearm. Hairs on the ventral fur have a dark base with mixed grey and yellowish tips; those on the dorsal fur also have a dark base and are bicolored with brown tips. The thumbs are very short. A concavity is present in the front of the dorsal side of the cranium. Based on morphological characteristics and phylogeny using Cyt b gene sequences, these bats were identified as P. homochrous, thus confirming the existence of Himalayan long-eared bats in China.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats, the second largest order of mammals worldwide, harbor speciﬁc characteristics such as sustaining ﬂight, a special immune system, unique habits, and ecological niches. In addition, they are the natural reservoirs of a variety of emerging or re-emerging zoonotic pathogens. Rhabdoviridae is one of the most diverse families of RNA viruses, which consists of 20 ecologically diverse genera, infecting plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, and ﬁsh. To date, three bat-related genera are described, named Lyssavirus, Vesiculovirus, and Ledantevirus. However, the prevalence and the distribution of these bat-related rhabdoviruses remain largely unknown, especially in China. To ﬁll this gap, we performed a large molecular retrospective study based on the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of lyssavirus in bat samples (1044 brain and 3532 saliva samples, from 63 different bat species) originating from 21 provinces of China during 2006–2018. None of them were positive for lyssavirus, but six bat brains (0.6%) of Rhinolophus bat species, originating from Hubei and Hainan provinces, were positive for vesiculoviruses or ledanteviruses. Based on complete genomes, these viruses were phylogenetically classiﬁed into three putative new species, tentatively named Yinshui bat virus (YSBV), Taiyi bat virus (TYBV), and Qiongzhong bat virus (QZBV). These results indicate the novel rhabdoviruses circulated in different Chinese bat populations.",

Only the unlogged gullies provided the species of trees\nrequired by the bats for roosting. Of these, the bats showed strongest preference for those trees with\na diameter greater than 80 cm. As the first logging cycle removed many suitable roosts, we conclude\nthat the second logging cycle, due before the turn of tbe century, will have a major deleterious impact\non the local survival of N. gouldi unless gullies remain unlogged. This would require the redefinition\nof gullies in the forest management plan to include all drainage lines.",
